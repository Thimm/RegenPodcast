**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:02:34):**  Continuing with this series of exploring natural building materials, design techniques, and  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:02:39):**  traditions, I spoke with my friend Trey Abernethy, a long time builder and now a bamboo craftsman.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:02:45):**  For over a decade, Trey worked in the industrial building trades before moving to Costa Rica  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:02:50):**  where he took a bamboo building course with Bridolfo Sainz that changed his trajectory.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:02:55):**  Trey now co-teaches bamboo building techniques with Bridolfo and designs and builds for clients  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:00):**  in Costa Rica.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:01):**  In this interview we cover a bit of every part of bamboo as a construction material,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:05):**  from the environmental benefits of planting bamboo columns, to selecting varieties for  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:10):**  construction to treatment methods, joinery techniques, design considerations, and long  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:15):**  term maintenance.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:16):**  Now I've been passionate about the potential of bamboo for a while now and even did an  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:20):**  internship with my friend and mentor Charlie Rendell, which led to designing and building  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:24):**  a few hybrid structures and homes around Guatemala.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:28):**  So if any of you are looking for more information on bamboo after you've listened to this  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:31):**  episode, I would really recommend the previous interview I did with Charlie Rendell, which  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:36):**  you can find links for in the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:39):**  We refer to a handful of other natural building materials and techniques in this session,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:43):**  so don't forget to have a look at the archives of the Abundant Edge podcast, including articles  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:47):**  on various earthen building techniques.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:49):**  Gradually I intend to build an audio library of natural building, so stay tuned in the  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:53):**  future and keep a lookout for previous episodes on these topics.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:03:58):**  Now I'll hand things over to Trey.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:00):**  Hey Trey, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:04):**  How are you doing buddy?  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:05):**  Hey Oliver, very good man.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:06):**  Excited to do this interview with you.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:08):**  Look, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:09):**  You and I have been in touch kind of off and on ever since you reached out to me via the  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:13):**  podcast and I'm really excited to finally dive in deep about all the experience and  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:18):**  the knowledge that you have around bamboo.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:20):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:22):**  Sounds great man.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:23):**  Alright, so do us a favor and tell me a little bit about your personal background and how  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:28):**  you became interested in bamboo building specifically.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:32):**  Sure, so I'm originally from Florida.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:35):**  I've been living in Costa Rica the last five and a half years.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:40):**  I've been a builder and a contractor for the last 16 years.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:44):**  Most of my adult life I started in the construction industry and trade building new homes when  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:51):**  I was 21 years old in Florida and worked in the conventional construction industry for  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:04:59):**  12 years or so before I moved to Costa Rica.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:05):**  A lot of that time building new homes, spec homes, just like cookie cutter box traditional  
**[0:05:10-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:10):**  wood frame construction houses in Florida and then got into remodeling and worked with  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:19):**  a contractor there that was kind of like a master of all trades and learned everything  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:25):**  from plumbing to electric to AC and high vac.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:30):**  We built docks and sheds and additions and that was a great learning experience to work  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:36):**  with that guy for three years and really put a lot of valuable skills and knowledge under  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:41):**  my belt.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:43):**  And then the last four years I was in Florida, I had my own company contracting.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:49):**  So yeah, I worked with this local contractor in Florida for about three years, got a lot  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:05:55):**  of experience in all facets of construction and remodeling with him.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:00):**  And then the last four years I was in Florida, I held my own company, mostly doing remodel  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:06):**  work, a lot of painting and tile and flooring work.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:12):**  And yeah, I was just very dissatisfied with the conventional construction methods and  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:18):**  just the waste and the toxicity of a lot of the materials and things I was using.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:24):**  So in Florida, I had always been interested in organic gardening and farming and had my  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:31):**  own gardens and stuff and then really got into permaculture.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:35):**  And with that exploration into permaculture, went hand in hand with natural building and  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:40):**  got very interested in cob and plasters and things in Florida and took some workshops  
**[0:06:46-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:46):**  there and really got involved in some cool projects, some cob and adobe and plaster projects  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:55):**  in Florida.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:06:56):**  And that really sparked my interest in the natural building world.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:00):**  And I was curious and interested in bamboo, there just wasn't a lot of opportunity to  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:04):**  explore that in Florida.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:06):**  But so when I moved to Costa Rica, I took my permaculture design course here a few weeks  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:13):**  after moving to Costa Rica at the end of 2013.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:18):**  And directly following that, there was an opportunity to take a week long bamboo and  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:24):**  cob and plaster course with a master, Tico, a Costa Rica builder.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:31):**  And yeah, I took that right after my permaculture design course.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:34):**  And that's really where my love for bamboo and excitement for bamboo started.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:40):**  And that was the beginning of my journey into the world bamboo.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:43):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:44):**  I love this story because it has so much kind of in parallel with my own.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:48):**  Like I worked in conventional building for about eight years all around the US and Canada  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:53):**  before I started to get interested in natural building and all the things that you can do  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:57):**  with local and processed materials.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:07:59):**  And that sort of went hand in hand with an understanding of the local ecosystem, how  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:02):**  to produce your own food, permaculture design in general.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:06):**  And the way that those two interrelate has always been really inspiring to me.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:11):**  So I'm wondering, with that very fast learning track that you hit when you got to Costa Rica,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:17):**  what were some of the connectors between permaculture design and your love of natural materials  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:22):**  that you started to explore?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:25):**  Well, when I moved to Costa Rica, I moved to a 175 acre off-grid permaculture farm that  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:35):**  was a budding intentional community.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:38):**  And so luckily, after taking my PDC and then the bamboo course, I was able to put all that  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:45):**  directly into practice on the farm, implementing some permaculture systems and gardens.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:52):**  And then starting, luckily there was a lot of bamboo on the farm and actually the owner  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:08:57):**  had a lot of cured and treated bamboo stockpiled.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:01):**  So we dove right into some building, some bamboo projects, and it was great to be able  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:07):**  to put it directly into practice.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:09):**  A lot of times people take PDCs or even natural building courses and then they just go back  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:15):**  to their nine to five job and don't really have the opportunity to put it right into  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:20):**  practice.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:21):**  And I was lucky in that regard that I was on a permaculture farm with a lot of bamboo  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:25):**  and some building projects to implement.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:29):**  And so I was able to take that knowledge and that experience and put it right into practice.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:34):**  And yeah, I mean, I've been a builder all my life, so a lot of working with bamboo is  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:41):**  pretty intuitive.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:43):**  There's a lot of specialty techniques and cuts and joinery and lashing and things, but  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:49):**  I was able to just dive right in and we built some really cool rancho structure on the farm.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:09:57):**  And then it was actually the next year that I was able to put on a little course with  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:05):**  my mentor, Rodolfo Sainz, who I took the bamboo course with and we did a little course on  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:11):**  the farm there that I was living at.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:13):**  And that was my intro into teaching.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:15):**  He was the main instructor.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:16):**  That was in 2015.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:18):**  That was the first course that I organized with Rodolfo being the main instructor and  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:24):**  me being an adjunct instructor.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:26):**  And that was my intro into teaching bamboo.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:30):**  Having worked with it for a little over a year on a consistent basis, I saw that there  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:38):**  was so much interest in the local area and bamboo and not a lot of people working with  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:42):**  it.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:44):**  So that's when I contacted Rodolfo, who was my mentor and who I had been studying with.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:50):**  He had actually come and helped with a project locally in the valley.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:10:57):**  That was my intro into teaching and now I've been teaching with Rodolfo the last three  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:02):**  years.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:03):**  We just put on a course back in May, which was our fifth course we've done together.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:09):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:10):**  Now look, I really want to explore the whole side of bamboo building and how this industry  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:17):**  affects so many different parts of a community and an ecosystem.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:21):**  But let's start with the potential of bamboo building.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:25):**  Tell me about some of the things that you can do with it, obviously focusing first on  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:30):**  buildings, and also what some of the limitations of bamboo are.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:34):**  Sure.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:35):**  Yeah, so in my mind, bamboo is the most regenerative building product on the planet.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:42):**  It's beyond sustainable in the fact that it's a large grass that shoots up new columns every  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:48):**  year.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:49):**  So unlike comparative to a hardwood tree, it may take 40, 60, even 80 years to mature  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:55):**  to be able to cut down and use for a building.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:11:59):**  A typical bamboo clump can produce 20 to 40 new columns every year for 100 to 150 years.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:09):**  There's a lifespan of bamboo, it goes to seed one time in its life and then the clump will  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:13):**  die.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:16):**  But you can plant a bamboo plant from a cutting or from a rhizome cutting and within four  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:23):**  years to four to five years, depending on the species, you can start to harvest columns.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:28):**  And then every year you're going to have new ones shoot up.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:31):**  So it's a beyond sustainable, it's a regenerative building product.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:35):**  And the applications for bamboo are extreme.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:40):**  There's thousands of industrial usage for bamboo.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:43):**  I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with bamboo flooring and bamboo kitchen implements  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:50):**  and bowls and plates and all kinds of things like that.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:12:54):**  But in the building world, I think there's a lot of misconceptions with bamboo around  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:00):**  the world.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:01):**  It's kind of considered a poor men's building product because it is very susceptible to  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:07):**  bug infestation and has a high sugar and starch content.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:11):**  So bugs do want to eat it, termites and beetles.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:14):**  But when it's properly treated, it can and is a lifetime building product.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:21):**  And we treat bamboo with a solution of borax and boric acid, which is naturally occurring  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:27):**  compounds that are pretty harmless to the environment.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:32):**  Even in a high concentration you could pour it out on, it's basically a naturally occurring  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:37):**  salt is what borax is.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:39):**  And it's a very inert solution to use to treat bamboo and it's very effective.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:46):**  So basically, we use a butary system, which is a pressurized treatment system that you  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:13:55):**  have a rubber boot and hoses in a tank and you strap it onto the bamboo and you tighten  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:02):**  down your rubber fitting and you force the solution into the wall of the bamboo at 16  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:09):**  PSI, pounds per square inch.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:12):**  And what it does is it basically pushes out the sugar waters in the bamboo and replaces  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:17):**  it with the borax boric acid water.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:19):**  Now do you have to perforate each of the nodes before you force that through?  
**[0:14:25-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:25):**  Not in the, you do in a dunk tape scenario where you're soaking the bamboo in a vat or  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:34):**  a tank of solution.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:36):**  But in the butary method, it actually percolates through the cell walls, the fiber walls of  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:44):**  the bamboo and it doesn't actually fill each nodal cavity.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:49):**  It just percolates and pushes it through the capillary of the bamboo outer walls.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:14:56):**  So bamboo is hollow and it has separate nodal sections and there's a solid little wall in  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:05):**  between each nodal section.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:07):**  And yes, you are correct if you are doing a dunk tape, a dunk tank solution or treatment,  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:14):**  you do have to perforate each nodal wall with a long piece of sharpened rebar or something  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:20):**  from each end so that the solution will percolate into it and fill each nodal cavity.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:27):**  But with the butary system, which is very efficient and uses a lot less solution, in  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:33):**  a dunk tank you have to imagine if you're doing eight meter pieces, you have to have  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:38):**  a huge dunk tank and hundreds of gallons of solution, which can be very expensive to,  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:43):**  to put together.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:46):**  But the butary system that my friend has created and I've implemented or copied with my, my  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:52):**  system is very effective and uses a very small amount of solution comparatively.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:15:59):**  All right.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:01):**  So tell me a little bit more about kind of the building potential of bamboo, what it  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:05):**  can be used for, but also some applications where it's not appropriate.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:11):**  So bamboo doesn't like direct sun exposure or water.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:17):**  So you know, you don't want to use bamboo in a scenario where it's going to be getting  
**[0:16:22-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:22):**  direct rain on it a lot or direct water exposure or a lot of direct sun exposure because it  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:29):**  can, the sun can make it crack.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:33):**  So you know, bamboo can be used in conjunction with cob, in conjunction with hempcrete and  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:41):**  in conjunction with, you know, earthen materials and plasters.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:45):**  It could be the framing of the walls.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:47):**  It can even be used as wattle, you know, for the wattle and daub cobbing.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:54):**  It can be, you can split bamboo and make it into estuary, which is like, you know, the  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:16:59):**  split bamboo that you fold out flat.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:01):**  Yeah, we've used that a lot.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:03):**  It's like making it into panels, right, that are still mostly stuck together, but there's  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:07):**  a lot of splits in between.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:10):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:11):**  So you can split it at each node with a, like a hatchet and then you're not doing contiguous  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:19):**  lines.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:20):**  So it's not like a separate splits that makes like little, you know, like two inch or one  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:27):**  inch splits that are separated.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:29):**  It's leaving the whole piece of bamboo together.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:32):**  And then once you break each nodal cavity with a hatchet, then you do a continuous cut  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:37):**  down one seam and then it folds out flat.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:40):**  And then that can be used, you know, directly on walls and left exposed as a decorative  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:49):**  element, a finished element, or it can be used on the framing of a bamboo wall as a  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:54):**  substrate to apply cob to.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:17:58):**  So you know, here in the tropics, we don't need the thermal mass that thick cob walls  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:03):**  give in the temperate climates.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:06):**  So what we typically do when we're utilizing cob and plasters here is do waddle and daub  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:10):**  style.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:11):**  And so, you know, you can have like a very thin wall, four to six inches, or the width  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:16):**  of the bamboo.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:18):**  And then that can be, you can leave the bamboo exposed, the studs exposed, or you can cover  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:24):**  them completely with the cob as well.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:26):**  But typically we like to leave the bamboo exposed, the studs, and then cob between them  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:33):**  with waddle and daub plaster.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:35):**  Yeah, I agree.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:36):**  I've done that a few times and I find it useful to at least be able to see the main support  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:41):**  columns just in case you're worried about how they might be weathering over time.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:46):**  True.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:47):**  And I think it's more aesthetically pleasing to leave the bamboo showing.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:51):**  That's true.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:52):**  It can be really gorgeous.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:53):**  Yeah, so I mean, you know, the applications for bamboo can be anything from a small little  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:18:58):**  hut to a five story building like they're doing in Bali in the green village, in the  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:03):**  green school.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:04):**  They're really on the cutting edge of bamboo design and architecture there in Bali and  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:10):**  are doing some really amazing things.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:11):**  They're building million dollar homes with bamboo that are completely made of bamboo.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:16):**  Everything from the flooring to the cabinets to the walls to pretty much every element,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:21):**  and the roof is bamboo shingled roofs.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:24):**  And I've got a lot of inspiration from the Ibuku firm, I'm sure you're familiar with  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:30):**  in Bali.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:33):**  And you know, here, a lot of people are moving to Costa Rica, buying land, trying to break  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:42):**  free of the matrix, get back to nature, you know, want to have a self-sufficient homestead,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:48):**  grow a lot of their own food.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:50):**  And there's a big growing interest in natural building materials and to live in a more harmonious  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:19:56):**  environment, you know, with natural materials, more connected to nature.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:01):**  Here in the tropics here in Costa Rica, a lot of people live in an open air style house,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:08):**  or you know, at least partial part of their house is open air, and letting natural breezes  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:13):**  and things through like, you know, for instance, I live in a 19 year old bamboo house that  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:18):**  was built by my friend here on the farm I live on.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:23):**  And the bamboo is in great shape, you know, it was treated.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:26):**  And you know, it's an open air house, got a nice breeze coming through, I'm on a hillside,  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:33):**  and it's an elevated platform.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:36):**  And you know, I don't deal with a lot of the mold and mold and mildew issues that a lot  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:41):**  of my friends deal with, that, you know, have fully enclosed houses.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:46):**  Really in that kind of ecosystem and that kind of climate, having an open air design  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:53):**  and with as much ventilation and, you know, not needing to batten down the hatches to  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:20:57):**  get away from, you know, the weather of most of the year is a huge advantage.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:01):**  Do you think that there are applications outside of that climate for bamboo?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:06):**  Oh, for sure, yeah.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:08):**  I mean, I think that, you know, the only thing is that a lot of the construction grade bamboos  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:15):**  are tropical species.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:17):**  But there are some temperate species of bamboo from Japan and other places that will grow  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:24):**  in even freezing temperatures and are suitable to build with.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:31):**  So there's, you know, I've heard of people, the thing is with the carbon footprint, like  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:36):**  if you're importing bamboo to Canada or the US from South America or Central America,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:41):**  maybe it doesn't make as much sense.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:43):**  And that's why I encourage people to build with local materials and what's suitable for  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:49):**  their climate, their environment and where they're at locally.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:21:55):**  You know, I don't really believe in importing things from China and other countries to build  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:00):**  with, which is the norm for your typical Lowe's, Home Depot, Box Store scenario in the States  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:06):**  or Canada or Europe is a lot of those products, those wood products are coming from other  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:12):**  countries, you know, a lot of the manufactured stuff is coming from China or wherever.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:18):**  And there's a big carbon footprint involved with that.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:20):**  And, you know, I really want to encourage people to, you know, build locally from the  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:27):**  materials that are most suitable for their environment and are coming from pretty close  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:33):**  by.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:34):**  For sure.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:35):**  Now, let's start at the beginning of this.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:36):**  I know you already talked a little bit about your treatment methods and how you make sure  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:41):**  that the bamboo will last for as long as possible.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:44):**  But even before that, when you're growing bamboo in commercial context, it has a lot  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:51):**  of advantages for the land itself.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:53):**  Can you talk a little bit about some of the environmental advantages and some of the economics  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:22:59):**  for the integration with other farming practices?  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:02):**  Sure.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:03):**  So bamboo has a lot of capacity, you know, to for soil erosion.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:09):**  It can be planted on banks, you know, to mitigate erosion.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:15):**  It can actually help to increase the water table in areas.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:22):**  It can be utilized for flood control.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:23):**  You know, it can be planted along rivers and streams that may have an issue of annual swelling  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:31):**  and flooding.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:32):**  And it actually can like trap the sediments and silts and things that are coming down  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:38):**  river in a flood situation and like end up building up a terrace behind the bamboo of  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:45):**  rich organic matter that can eventually be planted on when it reaches a high enough spot  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:51):**  above the floodplain.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:23:55):**  And you know, it has a lot of capacity for, I think that's one of the main things is the  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:05):**  erosion control.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:06):**  There's also, there's, you know, there's over 1500 species of bamboo in the world.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:13):**  Everything from, you know, a very spindly looking like grass, like, you know, quarter  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:19):**  inch bamboos all the way up to like dendrocalamus giganteus species, which can get up to nine  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:26):**  inches diameter and have a two inch thick wall at the base, which is, you know, massively  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:32):**  strong incredible, incredible bamboo.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:35):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:36):**  And bamboo is very, you know, it's an incredibly strong material to build with it actually  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:43):**  certain species of bamboo have more compression strength than concrete and more tensile strength  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:48):**  than steel by weight, which is pretty incredible to think about.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:54):**  Especially for how fast it regenerates as well.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:56):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:24:57):**  You know, and it is a big solution for the, you know, many parts of the world to, you  
**[0:25:07-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:07):**  know, because concrete is a very carbon intensive material to produce and build with.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:15):**  And that's, you know, the norm here in Costa Rica.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:18):**  They have these prefabricated concrete wall houses that the government will actually build  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:24):**  for people for free or, you know, if they apply, if they are applicable for it.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:30):**  And you know, that's the typical construction here is concrete and with the, the 10 roofs  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:36):**  and they're like little sweat boxes here.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:39):**  Oh man, I've seen them all over what we would call developing countries or underdeveloped  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:44):**  countries.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:45):**  And it's, it's certainly not just Central America.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:48):**  I've seen it in Asia.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:49):**  I've seen it in Africa, all around the world.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:51):**  And my goodness, the living conditions that this is creating for such a large portion  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:25:56):**  of the population, I've constantly been looking for alternatives, especially because in many  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:01):**  places, I don't know if this is a case in Costa Rica, but you're often very close to  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:05):**  communities or villages that were built in traditional ways with vernacular materials,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:11):**  Adobe.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:12):**  We did a lot of Bahreke in Guatemala.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:15):**  Have you seen that kind of contrast in the communities you've worked in in Costa Rica?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:19):**  Definitely.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:21):**  I mean, in the traditional indigenous communities here in Costa Rica, you know, they build with,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:28):**  they do utilize some bamboo, but it's more wood.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:32):**  Like in the, in the Talamanca and the Bribri villages here, they build a lot with wood  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:38):**  and thatched roofs and you know, all materials gathered from the jungle.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:45):**  They're not buying anything from, and there still are traditional villages here.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:49):**  They're becoming a little bit more westernized and influenced, but they still have their  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:56):**  traditional values and ways of building.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:26:59):**  And there is a definite, like, I'd say a growing interest and resurgence in bamboo here in  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:05):**  Costa Rica.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:06):**  And we're trying to be on the cutting edge of that.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:10):**  And also to, you know, we want to be able to make it an affordable option for people,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:17):**  for the locals and, you know, for low income people that may not have the money to, you  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:23):**  know, to build a $50,000 house or $100,000 house to be able to, you know, I'm working  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:29):**  with an architect here to come up with some designs and plans for very small structures,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:35):**  one bedroom with a simple kitchen and a compost toilet that can be built very cheaply with,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:41):**  you know, mostly bamboo and wood.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:45):**  And, you know, we want to be able to give people an option that's cheap and affordable  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:50):**  and you know, built with natural materials and there can be wildland, cob options and  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:27:58):**  you know, I don't use gypsum, I don't use drywall, I don't use, we don't even use a  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:03):**  lot of metal.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:05):**  We like to make bamboo pens and nail everything together with bamboo pens and lash it together.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:11):**  Of course we will use steel, all threads and whatever when it's applicable if it's a very  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:16):**  structural component that needs to be super secure and you know, you know, want to, because  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:22):**  we already have our things on.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:23):**  Yeah, there's appropriate applications for all of these things, but I've always respected  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:27):**  the way that you've gone sort of the extra mile and the way that you build to incorporate  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:32):**  as many of the natural materials or solutions as possible.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:36):**  Definitely.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:37):**  You know, and we like to also, you know, we don't like to build such a square rectangle  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:44):**  structures.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:45):**  We like to build rounded curved walls when we're working with cob and plasters and to,  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:53):**  we also, you know, do incorporate some sacred geometry into some of our designs.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:28:57):**  You know, I've built a lot of octagon, yoga decks and sextagons and like, I really, I  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:05):**  work with a very talented biomimicry and sacred geometry architect here named Michael Cranford  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:11):**  who is down in the ocean.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:13):**  He's actually part of my morpho design team.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:16):**  And you know, he's been studying biomimicry and you know, everything from the way that  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:25):**  a wasp designs its honeycomb, you know, and just incorporating what he sees and observes  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:33):**  in the forest and in nature, how animals and insects and different things and incorporating  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:39):**  that into, you know, because a bee's honeycomb is like, you know, it's a sacred geometry  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:45):**  design.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:46):**  It's very strong that you can replicate a lot of this stuff you see in nature into the  
**[0:29:50-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:50):**  design elements of a house or to make it very strong and beautiful.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:29:58):**  Well, let's explore that even further.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:01):**  What sort of design possibilities does bamboo specifically open up with the properties that  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:08):**  it has, which are different from other materials, perhaps you might be more accustomed to working  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:12):**  with in conventional construction.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:15):**  What kind of possibilities are available with this material?  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:19):**  Well, you know, in say, let's compare it to milled wood.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:25):**  You know, when you mill a hardwood, you cut it into a two by four, two by six, two by  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:31):**  eight, you know, four by four, whatever that is, it's a very square, rigid, you know, piece  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:39):**  of material that doesn't have a lot of movement and flexibility.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:44):**  Bamboo, depending on the diameter and the species, does have some flexibility.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:50):**  You know, you can curve and conform bamboo.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:53):**  But the great thing about bamboo is that every piece of bamboo is unique.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:30:57):**  You know, you're not going to have, a lot of bamboos do grow very straight and strong,  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:01):**  but you know, a lot of bamboo has a curvature to it, which we like to utilize those curves.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:07):**  And you know, you can have a handrail that might have quite a bit of a curve to it and  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:13):**  you just go out and select the bamboo that has that curve you're looking for.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:17):**  So you know, you can utilize bamboo in a lot of different applications that maybe aren't  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:23):**  an exactly straight line, you know.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:27):**  And you can also, there's ways to like cut high wedges into bamboo and make a complete  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:37):**  circle or a square with one piece of bamboo.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:40):**  And you've probably seen that in furniture designs and things where they, you know, they  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:43):**  cut out a piece of the bamboo and wrap it around the leg of a chair and the, you know,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:48):**  the seat of the chair can be one continuous piece of bamboo.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:31:53):**  So you know, bamboo has a lot of ability to put it into applications that you wouldn't  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:00):**  be able to do with wood or steel or other materials.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:06):**  Now with this biomimicry like you were talking about and some of the sacred geometry, what  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:12):**  are some of the energy flows and the spaces that you've learned how to make kind of collaborating  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:18):**  with other designers with Morfo?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:21):**  I'm sorry, can you repeat that?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:24):**  Like what do you mean?  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:25):**  Well so how has it shaped the way that you look at how you make spaces, facilitate functions  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:30):**  or open up energy flows throughout your buildings by integrating in concepts from the natural  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:37):**  world and the way that natural systems sort of function or facilitate other forms of life?  
**[0:32:42-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:42):**  Sure, I mean to me bamboo and cob and plasters, they just have a more of a feng shui and good  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:54):**  energetic feeling of the house when you're inside of it.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:32:58):**  You know, with natural materials in general, but especially bamboo with the round structure  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:04):**  of it, you know, and like to put your hand on it, it just feels good, you know, and it  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:09):**  looks good.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:10):**  And it's aesthetically pleasing.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:13):**  You know, there's not a lot of square corners and things in nature.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:16):**  You don't see a lot of 90 degree edges and things out in the forest or in nature in general.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:24):**  And so for me, like bamboo is a beautiful material.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:30):**  You know, there's multiple species and colors of bamboo.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:33):**  There's some beautiful black bamboos that we utilize for construction that can retain  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:38):**  their color if treated properly and sealed.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:42):**  They will some have a tendency to brown a bit if they're, you know, exposed to UV, a  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:47):**  lot of UV and sun exposure.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:51):**  But the application for bamboo are, you know, go way beyond building as well.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:33:56):**  It can be a food, you know, you can eat bamboo shoots.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:00):**  Certain species are, you know, been used in cuisine all around the world for thousands  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:05):**  of years.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:07):**  The textile uses of bamboo for clothing.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:10):**  I don't know if you've ever owned any bamboo clothing, but it's super soft.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:13):**  It's like, you know, softer than cotton.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:16):**  And it's a really feel, feels good to wear bamboo clothing.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:22):**  And obviously, I don't know if you how much you know, you're the listeners know about  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:26):**  cotton, it's a very intensive sprayed and water intensive crop to grow, whereas bamboo  
**[0:34:32-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:32):**  is not and it can be a solution and replace of cotton and for textiles and whatnot.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:41):**  And then, you know, of course, there's a lot of engineered bamboo products, flooring, you  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:46):**  know, tongue and groove flooring is sold throughout the world, bamboo flooring, and then they're  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:50):**  actually making bamboo laminated beams that are very strong, you know, can be a two by  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:34:56):**  12 beam that's actually separate tablets, pieces of bamboo that are glued and pressed  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:03):**  together in a heat form.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:05):**  And and they're very strong.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:07):**  They're like laminated beams.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:09):**  I would imagine those would have better tensile strength per weight than equivalent ones with  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:14):**  wood just because the interior fibers are significantly longer.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:18):**  And that's usually what gives it its flexibility.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:20):**  And even when it does break, it tends not to fail catastrophically.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:22):**  That was one of the really important things I learned about working with bamboo in Guatemala  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:26):**  is like, it can still fail without losing the building like you can get it to crack  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:32):**  or buckle a little bit, but it'll still hold a lot of weight even in its failed form.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:39):**  Because, you know, the like, for instance, like a termite damage piece of bamboo, which  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:45):**  I've seen a lot here, where, you know, the bugs have gotten in there and eaten most of  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:51):**  the interior wall of the bamboo, but the outer skin is what they don't actually eat.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:35:58):**  And it has crushed, I've seen like bamboo rafters on a roof that are crushed, and but  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:05):**  still holding together because it has that outer skin that hasn't.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:09):**  But unlike wood, like, you know, if it cracks, it's usually going to snap and collapse the  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:13):**  roof.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:15):**  So yeah, I mean, the outer skin of the bamboo and like you said, the fibers run continuously  
**[0:36:21-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:21):**  all the way up the bamboo along the whole continuous piece of bamboo.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:28):**  So yeah, you're correct in that, that the engineered, laminated pieces of bamboo, I  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:34):**  feel are stronger and safer to use than wood.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:38):**  Well, so let's go back for a minute and talk about some of the maintenance and increase  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:43):**  of lifespan options that there are.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:46):**  Like you said, the proper treatment from the bamboo that you order or that you source is  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:52):**  probably the first step that you can take in really ensuring a long lifespan in your  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:36:56):**  bamboo with the borac, the boracic acid treatment method that you mentioned.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:01):**  I've also heard of saltwater or seawater treatment options.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:06):**  And then from there, you said the others were sun damage and moisture damage.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:11):**  What can you do to prevent or mitigate those risks?  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:14):**  Sure.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:16):**  So yeah, if we want, I can just kind of run through some of the other treatment options.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:20):**  Yeah, by all means.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:23):**  And there, you know, there are multiple ways like in Japan, they do, they actually soak  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:27):**  bamboo for six weeks or more in the, you know, tie it with ropes or chains down to weights  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:33):**  in the ocean.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:34):**  And actually what, it's very similar in the end result of what you do with borax and boric  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:40):**  acid because you know, those are our salt based products that are basically pushing  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:46):**  out the sugars, sugar water and replacing it with saltwater.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:49):**  And so what you're doing in the, in the saltwater ocean scenario is you're just soaking it in  
**[0:37:55-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:37:55):**  there, freshly cut bamboo, and it's, you know, taking in the saltwater and soaking it into  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:02):**  the fibers and, you know, leaching out the sugar waters.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:07):**  You know, there's also another easy method for treating, and especially a more economical  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:15):**  one without having to put together a bootry system or have a dump tank, is you can actually  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:19):**  use the natural processes of photosynthesis and transpiration.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:24):**  So you can cut bamboo in the field and, you know, have buckets with your borax and boric  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:30):**  acid solution in the bucket.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:32):**  And you can cut the bamboo, just take the, take it while it's still alive and full and  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:39):**  lean it up into the clump and just put the base of the bamboo in the bucket.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:43):**  Depending on the diameter of the bamboo, you may do three or four per bucket or maybe just  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:47):**  one per bucket if it's a really large piece of bamboo.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:50):**  But the bamboo is still alive when you first cut it.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:54):**  The leaves are still attached and the branches and the photosynthesis is still actually happening  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:38:58):**  for a few hours.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:01):**  And so when you put it in that bucket, what it actually does is it'll draw up that solution  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:05):**  and percolate it all the way up through the entire piece of bamboo.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:10):**  And you know, we've done that in the field where I've, you know, in trials and like experimentation,  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:16):**  where we took like a seven inch diameter Guadua and had a five gallon bucket with about three  
**[0:39:22-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:22):**  and a half gallons of solution in it.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:24):**  We put that one cane in there and left it for 24 hours.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:27):**  We came back the next day and there was maybe less than a gallon of solution in there.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:32):**  So you know, that cane had sucked up about two and a half gallons or more of the solution  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:37):**  and we dyed it, you know, with a little bit of blue food coloring.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:41):**  And this was, you know, like a, I don't know, it was like a 15 meter piece of bamboo, maybe  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:47):**  a little more.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:48):**  When we dropped it and cut off the top, there was all of the fiber walls were blue.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:53):**  So you know, it had drawn up that solution and percolated it through the entire cane.  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:57):**  That's impressive.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:39:59):**  That's an easy way to do it.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:01):**  And a lot of what when we're, when we're butchery treating in the field, you know, we'll cut  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:05):**  the canes down to the size we want, put them on the machine and then we'll leave the top,  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:11):**  I don't know, five to seven meters of it, of the comb.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:16):**  And we'll put those in the buckets because there's still a lot of usable pieces there,  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:20):**  but they're, you know, a little smaller than we want to attach to the butchery.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:23):**  And we leave the branches and the leaves on and we'll put those in the bucket and leave  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:28):**  those for a day or two out in the field in the bucket.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:31):**  And then we can process and cut those branches down.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:34):**  The branches can be utilized for furniture, you know, the small branches, the, and then  
**[0:40:39-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:39):**  the ends can be utilized for small rafters on small structures or whatnot.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:46):**  So that's the transpiration method.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:48):**  It's pretty effective and easy to do and very cheap way to treat bamboo.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:40:56):**  You can also do smoke curing of bamboo that a lot of people in Asia, they have some like  
**[0:41:02-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:02):**  more industrial style setups where they put the bamboo in a big enclosed like shed and  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:09):**  they do it vertically usually.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:11):**  And then they'll have like a big oven or rocket stove and they'll channel the smoke in into  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:17):**  the chamber and it'll smoke cure the bamboo, which I don't have a lot of experience or  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:23):**  knowledge of, but that is a method that's utilized in Asia.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:28):**  But one of the, I think probably the most effective, but it's a very expensive to invest  
**[0:41:34-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:34):**  in is the oil pressure treatment systems where they actually, they have a pressurized oil  
**[0:41:42-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:42):**  tank that the bamboo goes in and you're putting in whatever type of oil it is that they use.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:50):**  I'm not exactly sure, but they actually, it impregnates the whole bamboo by pressure treatment  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:56):**  of the, it's like a vacuum chamber, I guess.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:41:59):**  And they pressure treat the bamboo with impregnating oil directly into the fibers of the bamboo.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:07):**  But I think the two main ways to treat bamboo throughout the world and the most common are  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:13):**  the butchery system, which is the pressure treatment system where you have an individual  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:18):**  piece, like a rubber connection that goes over the bamboo with the hose clamps.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:23):**  We have different sizes from two inch to six inch that for the, to match the size of the  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:28):**  bamboo you're treating.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:30):**  And then that's connected to PVC system that holds the solution.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:38):**  And then we have an air hose and a compressor that attaches to the top of this PVC setup  
**[0:42:46-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:46):**  that pushes the solution into the bamboo at 16 PSI is the ideal pressure that we've found.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:42:56):**  And within a couple of minutes after hooking it up and turning it on, you will start to  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:01):**  see water drip out the other side of the bamboo.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:06):**  And that's pushing out the sugar waters that are in the bamboo.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:10):**  And depending on the species, it can take 20 minutes to up to an hour to treat a cane.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:15):**  Depending on the length of the cane and the fiber density and the species, like black  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:20):**  bamboo treats very quickly.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:23):**  You can do six or eight meter pieces in like 20 minutes.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:26):**  And you can test the pH of the bamboo, the water coming out with like a little pH like  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:33):**  paper test strip.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:35):**  That's one way to determine that all the sugar waters have been pushed out because the sugar  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:42):**  water that is naturally in the bamboo will have a certain pH and then the saltwater will  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:47):**  have a different pH.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:48):**  And so that's one way to check it or a lot of times we use a dye to dye the solution.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:43:56):**  And then once you see like the dyed solution start to drip out the other side, you know  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:00):**  it's finished.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:01):**  Well, certainly in the case of treating with oil, does that start to affect its flammability  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:07):**  rating?  
**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:08):**  If it's impregnated with oil, does it become more flammable?  
**[0:44:13-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:13):**  It probably does.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:14):**  I mean, you know, we do like to seal bamboo, you know, after we treat it and then we start  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:24):**  we build with it.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:26):**  We do like to put a natural lacquer.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:28):**  I use linseed oil a lot.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:32):**  And that is to preserve the bamboo and to retain the color of the bamboo and to mitigate,  
**[0:44:40-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:40):**  you know, to preserve it, to make the longevity of the bamboo increase.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:48):**  One thing I'd like to dive into real quick that I didn't talk much about is, you know,  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:44:54):**  besides the insects like the beetle borers and the termites that like to eat bamboo,  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:01):**  the other big thing that you have to watch out for is fungal attack.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:07):**  And that's why it's very critical to make sure that after you treat and dry the bamboo,  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:14):**  you cure it and dry it to a certain percentage of dryness and then keep it at that percentage  
**[0:45:20-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:20):**  and don't let humidity and moisture build up on or in the bamboo because fungus can  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:26):**  grow inside of the bamboo.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:29):**  And then once you start to see the signs of fungus on the outside of the bamboo, it's  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:32):**  already compromised, you know, because it grows from the inside out.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:36):**  It'll start in the nodal chamber.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:40):**  And then it'll, once you start to see black fungus on the outside of the bamboo, you know  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:45):**  it's already impregnated.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:48):**  And so those are the two main concerns with bamboo is the propensity for fungus.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:45:56):**  But you can mitigate those issues by, you know, drying and curing it properly.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:02):**  So once you treat the bamboo, if you're doing a dunk tank or you're doing a butchery pressure  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:09):**  treatment system, then you want to properly dry the bamboo.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:13):**  And so we like to vertically dry it for a week to two weeks, depending on the species.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:21):**  And then we'll put it under shelter horizontally on racks and then further cure it for another  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:27):**  four to six weeks.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:29):**  And the color will change in the green bamboos.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:33):**  It'll start to lose the chlorophyll and turn more like a brown or tan in the curing process.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:43):**  And you know, that's very important.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:45):**  It's a very important step because a lot of people, you know, build with bamboo, they  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:50):**  just use it green.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:52):**  They'll cut it and just immediately build with it.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:46:56):**  And you know, yeah, those structures can last three, four, five, even 10 years I've seen.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:01):**  But you know, the insects will attack it usually and compromise the bamboo.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:11):**  And then, you know, if it's if it has any direct moisture exposure, then you can have  
**[0:47:17-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:17):**  that problem with with the fungal issues and mold.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:23):**  But you know, when it's treated properly, and it's dried and cured properly, it really  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:28):**  can and is a lifetime building product.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:31):**  And in Colombia, man, they have houses that are 150 or more years old that are multi generational  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:37):**  bamboo houses.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:38):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:39):**  Yeah, so like the traditional some of the traditional methods of curing bamboo in Colombia,  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:49):**  they actually do not use borax or boric acid or anything is what they do is they actually  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:54):**  cut the bamboo in the field.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:47:58):**  Leave it, you know, just leaning up into the existing bamboo clump and set the base on  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:03):**  a piece of rock or a piece of wood and leave it for four to six weeks.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:07):**  And what happens is it dries and cures and has like a vinegar vinegarization process,  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:12):**  where it naturally dries out the sugars and whatnot.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:17):**  I don't know the whole science behind it, but I do know that it does work.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:23):**  I have had a friend here in Costa Rica that has done that process with the bamboo he's  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:28):**  used to build his structures and most of the structures on his farm are about 12 years  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:32):**  old.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:34):**  There's no signs of insects or or, you know, fungal issues.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:38):**  He just lets it dry naturally in the in the clump with the branches and the leaf still  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:43):**  on it.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:44):**  And I think what it is is, you know, photosynthesis is still happening.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:49):**  And for a while, a little while after you cut it.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:51):**  And so it's utilizing up a lot of the sugars and starches that are in the bamboo before  
**[0:48:56-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:56):**  it like fully dies.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:48:57):**  So that's kind of my theory on it.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:00):**  So that's been shown to work so effectively in the past.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:03):**  How come there's not more, I guess, use of those methods in the more industrial or construction  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:10):**  industries for bamboo?  
**[0:49:12-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:12):**  Yeah, I mean, that's a good question.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:16):**  You know, there are a lot of industrial treatment processes that use a lot of harmful chemicals  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:23):**  in Asia and in South America where they use, you know, all kinds of different things.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:30):**  Sodium pentanate, like copper sulfate is one that's utilized a lot that does, you know,  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:38):**  is a harmful byproduct to put out into into the environment.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:43):**  And I don't even know what they do with the spent solution and stuff, but probably not,  
**[0:49:47-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:47):**  you know, getting into waterways and things.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:50):**  So that's why like I really like borax and boric acid.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:55):**  It's a proven effective treatment solution.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:49:58):**  They've been, I think it was pioneered originally in Bali, you know, maybe in the 70s.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:05):**  And they've been doing it there for, you know, decades.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:10):**  And that's what they do with the green school and which is like a huge bamboo school that  
**[0:50:18-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:18):**  they built in Bali.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:19):**  And then they have a whole green village community that they've built around it.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:23):**  That, you know, there's some five story incredible houses there.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:29):**  And they're treating with boric and boric acid and it's, you know, it's a proven treatment  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:33):**  solution that is effective and works.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:35):**  And you know, it's pretty cheap.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:38):**  You can buy a 50 kilo sack of it fairly cheap.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:42):**  And you know, and if it's done properly, either by a dunk tank solution or a butary system,  
**[0:50:51-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:51):**  you know, it can really be a lifetime building product and a sustainable regenerative solution  
**[0:50:57-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:50:57):**  to, you know, cutting down hardwood trees to build with and utilizing a lot of these  
**[0:51:04-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:04):**  other materials that have a high carbon footprint and a negative impact.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:09):**  For sure.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:10):**  Now let's go back to one of the things that you said that you used to seal the bamboos  
**[0:51:14-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:14):**  with once you started to build and that's linseed oil.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:17):**  Now I've used that in some of my own bamboo projects back in Guatemala and I was always  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:22):**  a little bit disappointed with how it performed, especially for UV protection, making sure  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:27):**  that sunlight didn't come in and damage it.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:29):**  And you also said that you use it to preserve the color of the bamboo a little.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:33):**  However, in my experience, it's often left almost like a burnt or an oxide type of a  
**[0:51:38-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:38):**  color once it gets in contact with the sun.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:41):**  Are you using any other types of solvents or additives to get it to work better?  
**[0:51:46-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:46):**  There is another product.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:49):**  Well, I should say like if there's any direct sun exposure, you're right.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:53):**  It's not the best solution.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:51:56):**  There is a product that we use here that's water-based called Laramax that I've used  
**[0:52:03-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:03):**  a lot on bamboo that is going to have some sun exposure.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:07):**  It's a clear lacquer.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:11):**  I'm not sure of exactly what it's made of, but I have actually been talking to a friend  
**[0:52:19-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:19):**  that's been using a new hemp oil-based wood sealer product for wood that he's been using,  
**[0:52:27-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:27):**  and he's having good results with it.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:29):**  I'm interested to explore that.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:33):**  And certainly if anybody's listening to this on the podcast, please feel free to reach  
**[0:52:37-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:37):**  out to us if you know of any good ecologically responsible products that help with the UV  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:43):**  protection of bamboo or wood.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:45):**  That's something that I'm always on the lookout for, mostly because though I may find one  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:49):**  in a certain region, it's not always available everywhere.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:52):**  So getting a poll from people who've worked with materials like this and products that  
**[0:52:57-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:52:57):**  they've found useful would be great to hear from too.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:00):**  So please get in touch with us if you know of any.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:03):**  Exactly.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:05):**  I mean, I'm definitely on the lookout for more ecologically friendly sealers, lacquers,  
**[0:53:12-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:12):**  and products.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:13):**  And I have experimented on some wood with an iron oxide-based sealer, but it kind of  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:22):**  turned the wood almost like a dull orange color.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:27):**  So it did change the color of the wood.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:30):**  But it's a powder.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:32):**  It's like an iron oxide-based wood sealer and preservative that you mix with five gallons  
**[0:53:39-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:39):**  of water.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:40):**  And I did have good results with that for wood, but I haven't experimented with it yet  
**[0:53:46-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:46):**  for bamboo because I was a little worried about it changing the color of the bamboo.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:51):**  I've always found that tricky too.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:52):**  You kind of got to do some test patches.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:53:54):**  But unfortunately, especially the more organic compounds or the ones that aren't too chemically  
**[0:54:00-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:00):**  based, they can change significantly in tints and color over time.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:04):**  So it takes a while to figure out exactly how it'll perform wherever you might be.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:08):**  I love linseed oil, like you mentioned, but I've always found it better for interior applications.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:16):**  And it does kind of either weather or kind of be a little bit inadequate in exterior  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:21):**  applications, especially when you're trying to overcome UV damage.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:26):**  Definitely, definitely.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:29):**  I mean, that's the thing is like, you know, bamboo will have the propensity to crack when  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:36):**  it's got a lot of direct UV exposure.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:40):**  You can mitigate some of that with proper curing methods and making sure it's fully  
**[0:54:45-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:45):**  dry and cured before you build with it, which is very important.  
**[0:54:51-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:54:51):**  But bamboo also, like when it's in a, say a roof rafter scenario where you have metal  
**[0:55:01-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:01):**  directly on the bamboo or just with like a three quarter inch per limb right above it,  
**[0:55:09-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:09):**  with that heat of the metal heating up and being close to the bamboo, it can sometimes  
**[0:55:17-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:17):**  have the tendency to crack the bamboo as well.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:20):**  But the thing about bamboo is even if you get these cracks in it, it's still structurally  
**[0:55:26-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:26):**  very strong and it's not in any danger of failing or collapsing as we mentioned earlier.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:37):**  I found the issue with cracking like that is it becomes an inviting place for pests  
**[0:55:42-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:42):**  and insects to live in.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:44):**  So it might not be causing any issue for the structure itself.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:48):**  It's not going to fail, but it can attract pests because it's a perfect little environment  
**[0:55:52-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:52):**  for them to live in.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:53):**  Sure.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:55:56):**  And bamboo does have some maintenance involved as most all building products do.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:01):**  You have a lot of maintenance with wood as well.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:05):**  But you definitely want to, I think that's really one of the most critical elements is  
**[0:56:13-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:13):**  in the treatment and the curing process so that you can mitigate any chances of fungal  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:19):**  growth in the bamboo.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:22):**  Make sure that you get out all the sugar and starches so that the termites and the beetles  
**[0:56:28-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:28):**  aren't attracted to it and going to eat it.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:30):**  And once you actually impregnate it and flush all that out and impregnate it with the borax  
**[0:56:34-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:34):**  acid, borax water, they actually can't eat it.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:37):**  It'll kill them when they take a bite of it.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:40):**  The salts are palatable to those insects.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:45):**  And they have that kind of a hive mentality.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:47):**  So they'll probably take a bite out of it and warn their buddies.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:50):**  Kind of my thoughts on it, stay away from this bamboo.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:53):**  Sure.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:55):**  I mean, go ahead.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:56):**  No, no, to change gears just a little bit.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:56:58):**  I'm wondering since you've been teaching courses on bamboo building for quite some time, could  
**[0:57:03-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:03):**  you tell us kind of what the learning curve in getting started is and the types of tools  
**[0:57:08-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:08):**  or machinery one would need to be effective as a bamboo builder?  
**[0:57:13-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:13):**  Sure.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:14):**  Yeah, so you can really build most things with bamboo with some simple tools, simple  
**[0:57:20-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:20):**  hand tools.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:21):**  It does of course help to have some specialty tools which I can outline.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:26):**  But you can really do most basic bamboo construction with a hand saw, a chisel, and a drill bit.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:41):**  You can build basic bamboo structures with not a lot of tools.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:46):**  We use pruning saws that have fine teeth that aren't specifically manufactured for bamboo,  
**[0:57:54-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:54):**  but there are some that actually are.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:56):**  We get from Japan.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:57:57):**  Silky is a really good tool brand that most of my bamboo saws are silky.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:02):**  It's a Japanese tool company.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:05):**  They make really quality tools.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:09):**  So you want a good hand saw with a fine tooth.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:13):**  For basic bamboo cutting, it needs to have at least seven and a half teeth per inch.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:19):**  And then you get into the 14 teeth per inch for the more finer tooth saws that we use  
**[0:58:25-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:25):**  for bamboo furniture making and more detailed cuts and things.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:31):**  Yeah, I think that often overlooked is because of the longer fibers and that silica content,  
**[0:58:39-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:39):**  especially on the outside of the bamboo, it can be really easy to leave frayed edges if  
**[0:58:43-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:43):**  you have a much larger tooth saw.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:48):**  And so I think what you're stressing right there is important to highlight that if you  
**[0:58:51-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:51):**  want to have clean cuts on your bamboo, if you don't want to have strips coming out that  
**[0:58:55-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:58:55):**  can cause unsightly marks on the outside, having those smaller teeth is really useful.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:01):**  Definitely.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:02):**  And when you're cutting a larger diameter bamboo, if you're cutting a piece that's got  
**[0:59:08-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:08):**  a lot like the end cut that's going to fall away, it's pretty large.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:12):**  You definitely want to have someone supporting that, like catching it.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:15):**  So that, you know, cause if you're just cutting it, it'll definitely have the propensity to  
**[0:59:20-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:20):**  like peel out a peel of fiber layer on the outside.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:24):**  And another good point is you want to underscore your cuts for those larger pieces of bamboo  
**[0:59:29-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:29):**  where you underscore the bottom side with a few cuts and then match up that line and  
**[0:59:35-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:35):**  that cut from the top.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:37):**  And that will mitigate the peeling aspect a lot.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:41):**  Line that up perfectly.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:43):**  But yeah, we use like, you know, chisels, spoon chisels, which are curved gouged chisels  
**[0:59:50-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:50):**  a lot to make holes in bamboo.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:53):**  You know, for inserting another piece of bamboo when you're doing furniture and things.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=0:59:58):**  We harvest bamboo with chainsaws.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:01):**  You know, you can of course harvest it with a machete.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:04):**  You can harvest it with a sawzall with a nice pruning saw blade on it.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:11):**  But for, you know, ease of use and like the more efficient and quick to harvest with a  
**[1:00:17-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:17):**  chainsaw.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:19):**  And you know, you do have some bamboo canes, you know, a big piece of ginger calamus at  
**[1:00:24-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:24):**  60 meters tall could weigh 400 pounds.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:27):**  So you really want to be careful of not pinching your blade, you know, when you're making that  
**[1:00:33-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:33):**  cut.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:34):**  You want to make a relief cut in the front and like maybe a pie wedge cut and then come  
**[1:00:38-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:38):**  from the other side at an angle so that you don't, you know, pinch your chainsaw blade.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:44):**  And I actually use, I have two Makita 36 volt battery powered chainsaws that are quite sufficient  
**[1:00:52-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:52):**  to work with.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:54):**  And you know, don't require any fossil fuels and can just be, you know, recharged on your  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:00:59):**  solar battery bank.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:00):**  And so I use those to harvest bamboo.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:04):**  And then we'll use just a machete to chop the branches off and then a sawzall with a  
**[1:01:09-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:09):**  nice pruning blade that's got like fine teeth on it to like process the branches and you  
**[1:01:16-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:16):**  can cut the bamboo down to size with that as well.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:20):**  And then another basic tool that you, that we utilize in bamboo is a hatchet.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:26):**  But it's not your like typical wood hatchet that you're, that people would probably envisioning  
**[1:01:30-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:30):**  when I say hatchet.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:31):**  It's more of a long, slender hatchet.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:34):**  And we use that for splitting bamboo, you know, for trimming branches off.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:41):**  And there's a lot of applications that we utilize the hatchet for.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:47):**  But a handsaw, a good bamboo hatchet, a few chisels, you know, you can do most bamboo  
**[1:01:54-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:54):**  construction with those simple tools.  
**[1:01:56-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:56):**  And then we have a lot of specialty tools that we use.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:01:59):**  You know, we have bamboo splitters that are like steel, high wedge pieces that either  
**[1:02:06-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:06):**  like are four, six or eight segments.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:09):**  And you can start that on one end of a bamboo and utilize, you know, wooden mallet or something  
**[1:02:15-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:15):**  and hit it into the bamboo and it's going to push through the bamboo and cut it into  
**[1:02:22-1:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:22):**  perfectly even segments for bamboo splits.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:27):**  And that's for, there's a lot of applications for bamboo splits.  
**[1:02:32-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:32):**  We utilize those tools.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:34):**  The other main thing that we use is a drill with a drill bit to make bamboo connections.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:41):**  So where you can pin two pieces of bamboo together with a bamboo nail or an all thread  
**[1:02:47-1:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:47):**  piece of steel with nuts and bolts, washers and nuts, I mean.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:53):**  And you know, that's one way to connect bamboo.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:02:57):**  So we utilize hole saws for making what's called a fish mouth connection on bamboo.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:03):**  It's basically a half circle, you know, where you'll cut through, drill through the whole  
**[1:03:08-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:08):**  piece of bamboo with a hole saw and it leaves, you know, half circle that the connecting  
**[1:03:15-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:15):**  piece of bamboo will sit in.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:17):**  So for instance, on an upright post in a wall, you can put a fish mouth cut.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:24):**  You want to do it right above a node where it's most strong, you know, within like five,  
**[1:03:28-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:28):**  six centimeters above a node.  
**[1:03:30-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:30):**  And you make that half circle cut and then your beam, your other piece of bamboo that's  
**[1:03:35-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:35):**  going to sit across your post will sit perfectly in that.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:39):**  And it's going to be a, you know, very close to the same diameter bamboo.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:44):**  So it actually sits in there perfectly.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:46):**  It's got a nice aesthetic connection point.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:49):**  And then, you know, you can underneath that, that post, you can put in a bamboo pen or  
**[1:03:55-1:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:03:55):**  a piece of steel, and then you can lash over the the beam to make a lashing connection  
**[1:04:03-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:03):**  with like, it can be multiple different types of box lashings with a frat or there's, you  
**[1:04:09-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:09):**  know, multiple styles of lashings that we use.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:12):**  But that's we do that a lot.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:16):**  And I mean, that's the lashing techniques that I most want to come back and work with  
**[1:04:20-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:20):**  bamboo to learn.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:21):**  I did a lot of steel connections.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:24):**  And like you said, the all thread rods to to make those connections strong for the houses  
**[1:04:29-1:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:29):**  that I built in Guatemala.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:30):**  But the lashing I mean, the history of that goes much further.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:33):**  And I feel like there's much more artistry in it to say nothing of the fact that it can  
**[1:04:36-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:36):**  often be stronger if it's done correctly.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:39):**  No, I think so.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:41):**  For sure.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:42):**  So you, you do want to, you know, typically, the best lashing, unfortunately, is not like  
**[1:04:51-1:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:51):**  supernatural style of lashing.  
**[1:04:54-1:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:54):**  It's like a polyester nylon cordage.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:04:58):**  But those are the ones that last, you know, the longest with like natural hemp rope or  
**[1:05:05-1:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:05):**  like other type of natural fibers.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:08):**  They just, especially here in the tropics, they don't last, you know, they'll  
**[1:05:12-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:12):**  really have you worked at all with the McGade, the stuff from the cactus?  
**[1:05:16-1:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:16):**  You know, I haven't I haven't.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:18):**  And that's one that we had in Guatemala.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:20):**  And that rope lasts for a really long time.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:22):**  I don't know if you've worked with Manila rope to for coconut fibers.  
**[1:05:25-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:25):**  I would imagine that there's some way to make that or get access to it in Costa Rica.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:29):**  Both of those I found though the the the Manila fibers tend to lend themselves to kind of  
**[1:05:35-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:35):**  thicker grade rope and maybe wouldn't would be too large of a diameter for lashing and  
**[1:05:40-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:40):**  bamboo.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:41):**  But if you get a McGade, you can get a really thin and those fibers are extremely strong  
**[1:05:46-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:46):**  and they don't really fall apart in heavy weather either.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:50):**  You know what, one one thing that we've been experimenting with and having good results  
**[1:05:54-1:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:54):**  with is actually banana fibers.  
**[1:05:57-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:57):**  No kidding.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:05:59):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:00):**  My you know, my mentor Rodolfo showed me this.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:04):**  And basically, you know, the the bananas like it's like a layers, you know, there's there's  
**[1:06:10-1:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:10):**  an herbaceous plant and it's there has the what you do is you peel off some of the layers  
**[1:06:16-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:16):**  of the stock of the bamboo.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:17):**  I mean, I'm sorry of the banana.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:20):**  And then you cut it into strips and you dry it in the sun.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:24):**  And then it can be woven together to make incredibly strong lashing and rope.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:30):**  And you know, we, we actually demonstrated that in our last course using it in a piece  
**[1:06:36-1:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:36):**  of furniture.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:37):**  And you know, according to Rodolfo, you know, he's he's built with it and seen it last 20  
**[1:06:43-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:43):**  years or longer.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:46):**  And so I am doing some experimentation with that and braiding these banana fibers together  
**[1:06:53-1:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:53):**  and experimenting with with lashing techniques with it.  
**[1:06:57-1:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:57):**  You know, just really diving into that now.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:06:59):**  But yeah, I'm always on the lookout for a more more natural lashing materials.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:06):**  And you know, because it's, it's definitely the way to go if it can last and if it can  
**[1:07:14-1:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:14):**  be durable, and if it can withstand the test of time.  
**[1:07:18-1:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:18):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:19):**  And then, you know, I think it's important as well to once you do lash everything and  
**[1:07:23-1:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:23):**  get it since down tight is to lacquer over the lashings to, you know, mitigate any stretching  
**[1:07:31-1:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:31):**  from the sun or once they're lacquered over and kind of like locks it all together and  
**[1:07:36-1:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:36):**  keeps it from loosening up ever.  
**[1:07:40-1:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:40):**  And then we do a lot of what's called frat lashings where you'll do like a box style  
**[1:07:45-1:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:45):**  lashing where if you have a perpendicular pieces of bamboo that you're connecting together,  
**[1:07:53-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:07:53):**  you will do what's called a box lashing and go over it and then you'll frat the lashing  
**[1:08:00-1:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:00):**  around the rope itself to tie it up against itself, which creates an incredibly strong  
**[1:08:09-1:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:09):**  connection and super, super tight.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:14):**  And there's there's really no moving it once once you lock that down and tie it off.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:19):**  Yeah, that's the only one I'm familiar with.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:21):**  I'm really looking forward to learning about the others.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:23):**  I really got into knot tying and lashing when I was working as a maritime engineer.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:28):**  We had to actually pass some of our tests on all the knots that we learned during school.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:32):**  So ever since then, I saw those as like cool puzzles, but also ways of attaching things  
**[1:08:37-1:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:37):**  like bamboo is a really cool application.  
**[1:08:39-1:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:39):**  Now before we wind down on this session, Trey, can you tell our listeners how they can come  
**[1:08:45-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:45):**  out and see you and learn for themselves how to work with bamboo?  
**[1:08:50-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:50):**  Sure.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:51):**  So you know, every year we're putting on bamboo building immersions here in Costa Rica.  
**[1:08:56-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:08:56):**  We just wrapped up a course back in May and we also did one in in January.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:01):**  We had such a great response for our January course.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:04):**  I really wasn't planning to do another one this year, but we had 27 students for the  
**[1:09:08-1:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:08):**  course in January.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:10):**  And right after the course, I had a lot of emails asking when the next course would be.  
**[1:09:14-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:14):**  So we went ahead and decided to do another one in May.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:17):**  And there's just been a great response to the courses.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:21):**  And yes, so we're going to be putting on our next bamboo course in January 2020 down at  
**[1:09:28-1:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:28):**  my friend's farm down in the Oso Peninsula, Finca Morfou.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:34):**  And then, you know, we also do teach other courses in cob and plaster and looking at  
**[1:09:41-1:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:41):**  bringing a friend down to teach a rammed earth course.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:46):**  And so but you know, we are focused mostly in bamboo.  
**[1:09:51-1:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:51):**  That is my preferred building method and material and really want to empower and inspire people  
**[1:09:59-1:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:09:59):**  to build with bamboo.  
**[1:10:01-1:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:01):**  So yeah, we have our next course be putting together the dates and getting it up on my  
**[1:10:08-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:08):**  website by the time this this podcast comes out, our website will be updated with the  
**[1:10:13-1:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:13):**  new dates and everything and people can check out our videos on the main page of my website.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:19):**  We have, you know, very nice video on our bamboo immersions and then some testimonial  
**[1:10:24-1:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:24):**  videos.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:27):**  And yeah, my website is naturalbuildingcr.com.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:32):**  They can they can contact me there if they have any questions about any natural building  
**[1:10:37-1:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:37):**  projects that you know, we also do contract services.  
**[1:10:42-1:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:42):**  You know, so I do offer I have a crew and you know, we we build bamboo houses we build  
**[1:10:48-1:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:48):**  cob Adobe plasters, stone and wood.  
**[1:10:52-1:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:52):**  And you know, we also have a full scale permaculture design firm that we started last year called  
**[1:10:58-1:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:58):**  Morf design.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:10:59):**  I'm working on a new website for that.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:03):**  Hopefully that'll be up pretty soon.  
**[1:11:06-1:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:06):**  But you know, we offer full scale permaculture master plan design services and implementation.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:12):**  So we're starting a big nursery as well.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:13):**  I'm starting a bamboo nursery and you know, tropical fruit tree and all the support species,  
**[1:11:20-1:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:20):**  the mineral accumulators, nitrogen fixers, ground covers.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:26):**  We're starting a big nursery project here to be able to supply the plants for our permaculture  
**[1:11:31-1:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:31):**  design projects and to also supply bamboo plants.  
**[1:11:36-1:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:36):**  And the other big project I wanted to mention is I'm starting a you know, a big bamboo treatment  
**[1:11:42-1:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:42):**  operation soon hiring and training five guys to harvest and treat bamboo five days a week  
**[1:11:49-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:49):**  so that I can have bamboo for all my building projects that we produce and supply ourselves  
**[1:11:56-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:11:56):**  and then be able to sell to the general public as well.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:00):**  Very exciting stuff, man.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:01):**  Trey, it's such a pleasure getting to explore this topic with you further.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:04):**  I really hope that I can coincide or like schedule the next trip that I have to Central  
**[1:12:10-1:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:10):**  America with one of these courses.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:12):**  I'd love to dive in deeper about bamboo.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:14):**  Awesome, man.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:15):**  Yeah, we would love to have you.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:17):**  Yeah, man, my mentor and who the other main instructor that I teach with Rodolfo Sainz  
**[1:12:23-1:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:23):**  is really an incredible bamboo master and artisan who's been working with bamboo for  
**[1:12:29-1:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:29):**  over 30 years.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:31):**  And I'm just very grateful to be able to teach these courses with him.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:35):**  He's a master bamboo furniture builder.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:37):**  You know, he worked almost exclusively building bamboo furniture for over 15 years.  
**[1:12:42-1:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:42):**  And then the last you know, 15 years he's been working as a natural building contractor  
**[1:12:47-1:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:47):**  and working a lot with mostly bamboo but with cob and plasters and Adobe and is just an  
**[1:12:54-1:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:12:54):**  incredible master of so many disciplines and I'm very grateful and thankful for his mentorship  
**[1:13:00-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:00):**  and to be able to teach these courses with him.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:04):**  And you know, we brought on a third instructor, my friend Joshua Daniels, who is also a master  
**[1:13:10-1:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:10):**  bamboo builder, who I've worked with at the Envision Festival here in Costa Rica the last  
**[1:13:17-1:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:17):**  five years.  
**[1:13:18-1:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:18):**  And he added a huge element to the last course, bringing him on board.  
**[1:13:23-1:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:23):**  He's a master treehouse builder and timber framer as well.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:26):**  And I worked on a few treehouse projects with him.  
**[1:13:30-1:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:30):**  And we're excited to start working on some bamboo treehouse designs and projects here  
**[1:13:34-1:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:34):**  in Costa Rica.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:35):**  But yeah, those are the three main instructors for our bamboo course.  
**[1:13:40-1:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:40):**  And then I also bring in my friend Henry Glenn, who is the expert in the bamboo treatment.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:47):**  And so he comes in, demonstrates, you know, in the seven day bamboo course, it really  
**[1:13:52-1:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:52):**  is a deep immersion into the world of bamboo where, you know, we harvest and treat bamboo  
**[1:13:57-1:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:57):**  with the students.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:13:58):**  So they see that process.  
**[1:14:00-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:14:00):**  And then we always have a main building project during the course.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:14:04):**  The last course, we just built a six by six meter greenhouse during the course.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:14:09):**  And in the last course in January, we built a black bamboo shower structure.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:14:13):**  I think a morpho that will be limestone plastering and finishing this coming year.  
**[1:14:19-1:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:14:19):**  Super exciting.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:14:20):**  Sounds like you've got a great team together there.  
**[1:14:22-1:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-trey-abernethy/#t=1:14:22):**  Well, again, Trey, thanks so much for taking time to break all of that down for us today.

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:30:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:40):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that anyone  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:06):**  can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves, their families  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:10):**  and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:19):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:21):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:25):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:39):**  Alright, hello everybody and welcome to the first episode in a brand new series focusing  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:45):**  on waterway regeneration.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:46):**  In the last few years of hosting this show, it's become vividly clear to me just how important  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:52):**  and yet overlooked an issue that the health of our water cycles are.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:01:57):**  While the climate change narrative has mostly focused on the concentration of CO2 and other  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:01):**  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution, we've ignored the essential  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:06):**  role that the water cycle plays in regulating global temperatures.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:11):**  In this series, I'll be speaking to an incredible list of scientists, farmers, and restorationists  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:15):**  who are dedicated to reviving the precious waterways of the world.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:20):**  From the urban environment to the deep seas, our actions will determine whether or not  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:24):**  we preserve our aquatic resources and all the life that depends on them for future generations.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:30):**  Now in this first episode, I got to speak with Enric Sala, a renowned ecologist making  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:34):**  a clear case for why protecting nature is our best health insurance and why it makes  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:39):**  economic sense.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:41):**  Enric is the director of National Geographic's Pristine Seas Project, which has succeeded  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:46):**  in protecting over 5 million square kilometers of ocean and created 22 marine reserves.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:52):**  Dr. Sala has received the Young Global Leader Award by the World Economic Forum, a Research  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:02:58):**  Award from the Spanish Geographical Society, the Lowell Thomas Award from the Explorers  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:03):**  Club and a Hero Award from the Environmental Media Association.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:07):**  In his new book, The Nature of Nature, Why We Need the Wild, he tells the story of his  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:12):**  scientific awakening and his transition from academia to activism.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:17):**  More importantly, he shows the economic wisdom of making room for nature, even as the population  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:22):**  becomes more urbanized, and how saving nature can save us all by reversing conditions that  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:27):**  led to the coronavirus pandemic and preventing other global catastrophes.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:32):**  Now in this interview, we begin by unpacking the changes that have occurred in our oceans  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:36):**  in the last few decades and how this is affecting people all over the world, even if you don't  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:41):**  live anywhere near the sea.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:43):**  NRECC also offers a lot of hope that our oceans can recover if we act swiftly and give them  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:48):**  the space and protection to regenerate, as well as ways to do that.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:52):**  I learned a lot from this talk and as I begin to learn more about how marine health is closely  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:03:56):**  linked to terrestrial health, I would encourage those of you listening to examine how your  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:01):**  own habits and lifestyle choices are connected to ocean health in ways that can be hard to  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:06):**  see.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:07):**  So, let's get this series started and I'll hand things over to NRECC.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:10):**  Dr. NRECC, thank you so much for taking time to be with me today.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:13):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:14):**  I'm fine.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:15):**  Thank you so much for having me.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:16):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:17):**  Look, this is the episode that is going to kick off this new series on regenerating waterways.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:22):**  And I'm thrilled to speak to you about this because you have quite a lot of experience,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:27):**  especially when it comes to ocean ecosystems.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:29):**  Now, you started out as a research scientist and in the past, you've said that you got  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:34):**  tired of, what you'd say, writing the obituaries of the oceans and decided to finally do something  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:41):**  about it instead.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:43):**  Could you start off by sharing a little about what led to the founding of Pristine Seas  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:48):**  and what their mission is?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:50):**  Yeah, you're right.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:51):**  I used to be a professor at the University of California in San Diego.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:04:58):**  And my job was to conduct scientific research to understand what are the impacts of human  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:03):**  activities in the ocean, the impacts of fishing, global warming.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:07):**  And one day I realized that all we were doing was just refining the obituary of the ocean  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:13):**  with more and more precision.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:16):**  And that day I decided to quit academia.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:19):**  And I went back to Catalonia, where I'm from.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:23):**  I think where you're based right now.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:25):**  That is where I am, yeah.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:26):**  We're not far at all from where you got started.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:30):**  But farther north from where you live, I went back there for a year to think.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:35):**  And I came up with this idea of why don't we go to the most remote places in the ocean,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:42):**  places that are still near Pristine, and try to protect them before it's too late.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:47):**  So I came to National Geographic Society in Washington DC in 2008 and made a proposal  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:54):**  to them.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:55):**  So let's do expeditions to the most remote places.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:05:59):**  Let's conduct scientific research.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:01):**  Let's produce films.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:02):**  Let's try to inspire the leaders of these countries that own these places to protect  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:09):**  them in large marine reserves, in large national parks in the sea.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:13):**  And in their infinite wisdom, they love the idea.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:17):**  And I moved to Washington in July 2008.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:20):**  And so since that founding with this mission that you've had, what have been some of the  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:24):**  things that you've been able to accomplish and the work that's gotten done since the  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:28):**  beginning?  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:29):**  Yeah, the goal, our goal was to help to protect places in marine reserves, places without  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:36):**  fishing, drilling, mining, without any extractive activity.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:42):**  And we have been very fortunate to have been involved in the creation of 22 of the largest  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:47):**  marine reserves on the planet in the last 12 years.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:51):**  And when you put all the surface together, it's over half the size of the United States.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:06:58):**  Yeah, that's not an insignificant amount of space.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:02):**  Now let's start by getting a bit of a rundown of some of the major changes in the ocean  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:07):**  ecosystems over the past 100 years and what this tells us about what the future will look  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:13):**  like for the health of these ecosystems if we continue down this path.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:17):**  Yeah, you know, humans have been using the ocean for thousands of years, but that probably  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:23):**  what happened in the last 100 years has had an impact that has been much larger than the  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:28):**  ocean throughout all previous human history.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:31):**  In the last 100 years, we have lost 90% of the large fish in the ocean, sharks, tuna,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:39):**  jacks, grouper, cod.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:42):**  Global fisheries have increased their catch after the Second World War, but we reached  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:48):**  big fish in 1996.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:51):**  And the global catch of wild fish has been declining since.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:07:55):**  Two thirds of the fish stocks are experiencing overfishing, which means that we are taking  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:00):**  fish out of the ocean faster than they can reproduce.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:03):**  So the news are not good when it comes to our exploitation of the ocean, which except  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:10):**  for a few exceptions, it's not sustainable.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:15):**  We cannot continue this way.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:17):**  There is another study that we published in 2006, projecting that if we continue fishing  
**[0:08:24-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:24):**  the ocean at this rate, most fisheries will collapse by 2050.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:31):**  In addition to that, we have global warming, which is making the ocean warmer and more  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:36):**  acidic, killing coral reefs, melting the polar caps and affecting fish and other species  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:43):**  all around the world's oceans.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:46):**  And finally, we have pollution.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:48):**  And right now, what is more conspicuous than our plastic pollution that has reached all  
**[0:08:55-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:08:55):**  of the ocean from the shallows to the deepest part of the ocean and the most remote places.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:03):**  So we have to do three main things.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:04):**  One is we need to stop throwing plastic into our environment.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:10):**  We need to find alternatives to solve the pollution issue.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:13):**  Two, we need to face off fossil fuels and shift to a renewable energy economy so we  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:20):**  can reverse the warming of the planet and the warming of the ocean.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:25):**  And three, we need to reduce the effort that we are putting into fishing if we want to  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:31):**  continue fishing in the future.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:33):**  And we have to complement this with at least 30% of the ocean in marine reserves.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:40):**  So those are all very big and broad things that we need to change.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:45):**  And those have been echoed through a lot of organizations and businesses and governments.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:49):**  It's fairly understood that all of those things need to be advanced in order for all ecosystems  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:56):**  to recover.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:09:57):**  What have you found that are actual, I guess, metrics or solutions that you've seen work  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:04):**  and have started to move anything in the right direction?  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:07):**  Because as a whole, those things that you mentioned are not at all happening yet.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:12):**  Some are happening faster than others.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:15):**  None is making the progress that we need.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:16):**  But the solution that is most cost effective, that has a faster response is ocean protection.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:27):**  We have seen, I have seen it with my own eyes, off the Medas Islands, a little farther north  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:34):**  from Barcelona and many other places around the world where we protect places from our  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:39):**  activities from extraction and destructive activities, marine life comes back spectacularly.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:46):**  We did a study using data from marine reserve from all around the world.  
**[0:10:51-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:10:51):**  And we saw that the abundance of fish inside these marine reserves is 600% greater.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:00):**  It's over six times greater than in unprotected areas nearby.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:05):**  Not only the fish in these areas are more abundant, but also they are larger.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:10):**  They, and I used to joke about this, but it's serious.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:16):**  When you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:18):**  They grow larger.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:20):**  They have more sex and they produce many more eggs, which helps to replenish the areas around.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:26):**  So these protected areas, if they are well managed, they will recover the abundance of  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:32):**  fish within their boundaries and they will replenish the areas around.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:39):**  So we will have increased economic opportunities through ecotourism inside the reserves.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:45):**  People want to dive where there are fish, of course.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:48):**  And then outside the boundaries of these reserves, the fishermen will also benefit because they  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:53):**  will have more fish to catch.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:11:55):**  So this is the fastest, most cost effective solution that we have seen in the ocean.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:00):**  Now that can sometimes seem a little counterintuitive because all of the seas and the oceans are  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:06):**  connected.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:08):**  And some people, including myself, previously before looking into some of the work that  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:12):**  you did, would think that because all of these are connected, that they're equally at risk.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:19):**  Some of the things that you talked about, the acidification of oceans, I would imagine  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:23):**  is not just happening in certain spots, it's a larger trend.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:27):**  But are there areas that are more at risk than others and certain parts of the world  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:31):**  at higher risk as well?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:32):**  Or do these trends mostly affect the wider area?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:37):**  You are absolutely right that the threats are not happening at the same intensity everywhere.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:44):**  There are areas that are warming faster, like the Arctic, for example.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:49):**  Other areas are also more prone to acidification of the ocean.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:12:56):**  And when it comes to fishing, we have done something that when you look at it, makes  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:03):**  lots of sense.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:04):**  You fish what you have near you, near the coast.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:07):**  And as you deplete the fish populations near the coast, you move farther offshore and deeper.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:14):**  Basically we have depleted many of the shores of the world.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:20):**  And the Mediterranean, for example, is the most overfished sea on the planet historically.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:26):**  We've been fishing there for thousands of years.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:29):**  So the solutions work everywhere, but the benefit is going to be different for different  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:36):**  places.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:37):**  So the more exploited one place is, the faster that place will recover or the greater the  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:45):**  relative benefit that we'll get from protecting, which means that the place that has been overfished  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:50):**  is going to benefit more from protected areas than a place that is pristine.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:56):**  So there are areas that are priorities.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:13:59):**  We have a study showing that if we protected 20% of the ocean strategically, we would be  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:06):**  able to preserve much of the biodiversity.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:10):**  But if we also want to continue feeding the world, we would protect areas that in addition  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:16):**  to that, to preserving biodiversity also help to replace the fisheries.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:22):**  So the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly telling us that we need to protect at least  
**[0:14:29-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:29):**  30% of the ocean if we are to prevent extinction of species and if we are to improve our food  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:38):**  security.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:41):**  And that also seems sometimes counterintuitive that by protecting areas of the ocean that  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:45):**  you can actually receive better economic activity from fishing.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:49):**  And like you said, those breeding grounds that are created, obviously they don't just  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:53):**  stay within that and they don't respect sort of arbitrary borders that we draw out on a  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:57):**  map.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:14:58):**  They continue to migrate and go to other areas.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:01):**  Now I personally worked in the fishing industry in Alaska for the salmon and the hak and the  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:09):**  pollock fishing seasons.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:12):**  And some of those have much larger migratory patterns.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:15):**  And I remember speaking with some of even the research scientists who were coming in  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:19):**  taking data from the fisheries in order to keep an eye on how things were operating,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:25):**  talking about how a lot of the returns to the area of Alaska that we were at were smaller  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:30):**  because of deep ocean fishing from Japanese trawlers out in the deep water and getting  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:36):**  them before they actually come back to spawn in the rivers.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:39):**  So is there still a case to be made that protecting localized areas in places like Alaska can  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:46):**  prevent the depletion of fish when they're still kind of outside of the borders of control?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:52):**  Or is this something that needs to be kind of acted upon unilaterally between Japan and  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:15:57):**  other actors in the process for it to have a real effect?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:01):**  Yeah, no, you hit a key point here.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:03):**  There are some species of fish that move very little, right?  
**[0:16:08-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:08):**  So if you protect, if you create protected areas within a country's waters, the fishery  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:16):**  industry is going to benefit within those waters.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:19):**  But there are species that migrate like the tuna, for example, or salmon.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:23):**  Salmon migrates across the Northwest Pacific, but the tuna migrate through entire ocean  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:30):**  basins.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:31):**  You have the glufine tuna, Atlantic glufine tuna crossing from the Gulf of Mexico to the  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:37):**  Mediterranean to reproduce and then back.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:41):**  So how do we do?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:44):**  How do we manage species that move in between countries that also go through international  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:49):**  waters beyond national jurisdiction?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:52):**  And there are some organizations that are supposed to deal with this.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:16:56):**  It's what is called the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, RFMOs.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:03):**  And for the Atlantic, for example, you have the RFMOs composed of countries on both sides,  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:09):**  but also other countries with a huge stake on tuna fishing like Japan.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:14):**  So this commission for the conservation of Atlantic tuna is supposed to determine how  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:21):**  many tuna can be caught every year to make sure that the species is viable and sustainable.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:28):**  Unfortunately, the decisions are political.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:31):**  So Japan and Spain and other countries push for the quotas, for the allowed quotas to  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:38):**  be higher than what the scientists recommend because these countries and these industries  
**[0:17:44-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:44):**  are driven mostly by short-term profits instead of long-term sustainability.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:51):**  So the mechanisms are there to ensure the conservation, the viability of these species  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:17:56):**  that migrate in between countries.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:00):**  But in most cases, it's not working because these species continue to be depleted.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:06):**  So we do have the mechanisms.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:08):**  We do know what we need to do to manage fisheries sustainably and to protect more areas.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:15):**  But unfortunately, we are dealing with humans and with industries, especially the industrial  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:21):**  fishing lobby that is more interested in short-term profits.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:27):**  Speaking as someone who grew up in the middle of the United States for most of my life,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:31):**  or at least most of my childhood and away from any coast, I would think that issues  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:37):**  like this dealing with ocean ecosystems wouldn't have a whole lot of an impact for inland dwellers.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:43):**  Can you tell me how the health of the oceans can have a direct impact on people not living  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:47):**  anywhere near the sea?  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:49):**  Yeah, that's a fair question.  
**[0:18:52-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:18:52):**  And most people believe that consumption of wild animals in China was not affecting them.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:00):**  And look, now we have a global pandemic that has stopped everybody's lives, that has created  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:07):**  the largest, the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, that has killed  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:13):**  hundreds of thousands of people around the world.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:17):**  And that happened because one person in China was infected with a virus that jumped, that  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:24):**  spilled over from a wild animal to that person.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:29):**  Now this coronavirus pandemic is the loudest wake-up call in recent times that we are not  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:38):**  in isolation with nature or with other people.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:41):**  Our health, the health of anybody living in Idaho, is dependent on the health of the poorest  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:48):**  person of the poorest country on the planet.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:19:53):**  This coronavirus, COVID-19, before it was SARS, MERS, Ebola, Zika, rabies, etc.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:02):**  So it's our globalized lifestyle has made our impacts global, our footprint global,  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:10):**  but also has connected all of us, not only human to human, but human with all species  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:17):**  on the planet in a way that we had never seen before.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:20):**  And the health issues are not something that are related to global wildlife trade or destruction  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:26):**  of forest in Africa.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:27):**  Ocean ecosystems also are very important for people's health.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:34):**  We have seen harmful algal blooms, these red tides being much more abundant and persistent  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:41):**  in areas where the ecosystems have been degraded, have been overfished and polluted.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:46):**  So many of the pollutants, the toxins that these microscopic algae that create the red  
**[0:20:51-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:20:51):**  tides are then vaporized and transported to the coast with the waves and the wind.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:00):**  And people are having more asthma and other respiratory issues.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:05):**  But when it comes to somebody who lives far away, now the ocean produces more than half  
**[0:21:09-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:09):**  of the oxygen that we breathe, more than all the plants in the forest of the land together.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:17):**  The ocean regulates our climate also.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:22):**  And our activities on land, our burning of fossil fuels is warming the ocean and diminishing  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:31):**  the ability for the ocean to absorb much of our carbon pollution, but also to continue  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:36):**  making our climate stable and predictable, as we are already seeing.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:42):**  So these are just a few of the reasons why ocean health is affecting everybody around  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:51):**  the world.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:52):**  And it's not just the ocean.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:53):**  It's the health of our natural world.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:21:57):**  Have you seen any evidence to suggest that the proliferation of zoonotic diseases like  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:02):**  the coronavirus are possible for marine species to humans?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:05):**  Or is that still pretty safely separated?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:09):**  Yes, there are diseases like cholera, for example.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:13):**  There are pathogens that are transmitted to humans via marine animals.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:21):**  But not directly.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:22):**  Like, you know, if a fish bites you, probably you're not going to get one of these infectious  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:28):**  diseases.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:29):**  All these, the recent zoonotic diseases have a terrestrial origin.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:33):**  But there are diseases that affect humans when humans consume toxic fish, for example.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:41):**  These red tides can kill fish and shellfish like oysters and mussels, but also these animals  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:48):**  absorb this algae and these toxins in their tissues.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:52):**  And when people eat them, they can get very sick and die.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:22:56):**  We have seen on coral reefs where you have a pristine coral reef, the water is very clean.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:04):**  There are very few bacteria.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:06):**  As soon as we start overfishing and removing animals like the giant clams that filter the  
**[0:23:11-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:11):**  water, then we are facilitating the blooms of bacteria, many of which are human pathogens,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:21):**  like the bacteria that causes the cholera, for example.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:24):**  So by degrading marine ecosystems, we are turning the ocean into more of a microbial  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:31):**  soup.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:32):**  But also we are increasing, we are producing a rise of the microbes of the pathogens that  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:39):**  affect humans too.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:41):**  And in your opinion, why do you think it's been so difficult to connect public concern  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:46):**  with issues regarding the ecosystems of the ocean?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:49):**  Do you think it's more just because it's a disconnect that most people don't live either  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:54):**  terribly close or directly interacting with the ocean on a regular basis?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:23:58):**  Or just because so little is still known about the complexity of the ecosystems off of our  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:03):**  shores?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:04):**  Yeah, ecosystems are so complex.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:06):**  We know so little.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:08):**  There are 9 million species of plants and animals on the planet and probably 1 trillion  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:19):**  types of microbes.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:20):**  But we have described, scientists have discovered and described about 2 million of those only.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:29):**  So we know very little.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:30):**  And if we know little about who these species are, we still know less about what they do.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:36):**  But we know enough to know that if we disturb these ecosystems, if we remove species, if  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:44):**  we deplete species, if we degrade habitats, the whole system collapses.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:50):**  And with the collapse of the ecosystem also go the old ecosystem services that this species  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:24:57):**  provide for us like oxygen, water filtration, flood protection, pollination of our crops,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:04):**  etc, etc.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:05):**  So we don't know enough, but we know enough to know what we shouldn't do, which we should  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:13):**  not do more harm, we should protect more areas.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:17):**  And when it comes to what we can do about it, it is clear.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:26):**  I like to use an analogy.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:28):**  Imagine that you are about to board a plane and the flight attendant tells you that we  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:36):**  are missing five screws.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:37):**  We don't know what the function of these screws are.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:42):**  Maybe it's in a wing or on the engine, but we know we're missing five screws.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:47):**  Would you board that plane?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:50):**  But we think that this is not safe, but we are removing species.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:25:56):**  We are driving species extinct from ecosystems without knowing what the role is and the consequences  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:03):**  can be catastrophic.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:04):**  Sure.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:05):**  And I think a lot of cases we're not even aware of where we're losing those species  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:08):**  from or at what rate either.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:12):**  Although those unknowns are kind of stacking up to a situation that we're not aware that's  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:17):**  happening or the, like I said, the speed at which it's occurring.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:23):**  And we're very, very unprepared for the consequences in the sort of downstream effects as well.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:31):**  Yes.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:32):**  And you mentioned why people don't feel about the ocean is we humans are very good at not  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:41):**  caring about things that are out of sight, right?  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:44):**  Out of sight, out of mind.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:46):**  And scientists have been warning people about the impacts of global warming for decades,  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:52):**  but many people thought, well, this is something that is going to happen in the future.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:56):**  It's not going to happen to me.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:26:58):**  Scientists have been warning people about the consequences of loss of nature for decades,  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:04):**  but people say, well, this is something that happens in the Amazon where they are burning  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:08):**  the forest or cutting the forest.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:10):**  This is affecting me.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:13):**  But again, this coronavirus pandemic has made it very clear that the destruction of nature  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:22):**  is affecting all of us.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:25):**  This is, I hope, the straw that broke the camel's back.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:28):**  I hope that the COVID-19 pandemic is going to be the time where humanity will wake up  
**[0:27:34-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:34):**  and realize that we are not the masters of the universe, but we are a part one interdependent  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:43):**  and interacting component of the larger community of organisms on our planet.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:50):**  I think we need a little more humility.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:53):**  Our technology will not save us from ourselves.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:27:57):**  What we need to do is to change our behavior, but human nature is probably much more complicated  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:03):**  than changing human behavior.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:06):**  It's more complicated than sending a space probe to Jupiter.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:11):**  That's one of the things we have to deal with.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:13):**  We have to deal with humans.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:15):**  It also seems like, even though it's maybe not super intuitive for most people to realize  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:20):**  how ocean ecosystems affect people further inland, it can also be difficult to see how  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:25):**  those people inland are directly affecting the health of the oceans.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:29):**  For example, the way that agricultural runoff and sediment from loss of topsoil in the Midwest  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:36):**  drains down the Mississippi River and is contributing to the dead zone in the Mississippi Delta.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:42):**  There's examples like that all over the world where bad practices of ecosystem management  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:46):**  from much, much further inland are directly responsible for impacts like the destruction  
**[0:28:52-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:28:52):**  of coral reef systems and acidification and toxicity in oceans that are literally downstream  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:00):**  from where those contaminants are generated.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:03):**  I think this example is a perfect illustration of how our activities, no matter where on  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:12):**  the land, affect the ocean because the ocean is downstream of everything.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:16):**  Another example is burning coal to generate energy releases mercury in the atmosphere.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:25):**  That mercury ends up in the ocean.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:27):**  The tuna and the large fish eat smaller fish that have been eating little shrimp that have  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:34):**  been living in little algae that have incorporated mercury in their tissues.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:38):**  The larger the animal, the more pollutants it accumulates over their lifetime.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:45):**  We end up eating the toxic mercury on fish that comes from our own emissions.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:29:57):**  We ended up eating not only mercury and other pollutants, but also microplastics that we  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:03):**  have thrown in the environment.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:04):**  We are eating our own crap, basically.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:07):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:08):**  Like you said, there's so many examples of that.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:11):**  Now, we've talked about a lot of the grim situations about the impact that humans are  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:16):**  having on oceans and such.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:18):**  Let's switch gears a little bit now and talk about some of the things, like we've already  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:22):**  gone over a little bit, that are really having a positive impact and starting to move the  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:26):**  needle towards regeneration.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:28):**  You mentioned ocean conservation as being one of the most effective ways, especially  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:34):**  to combat things like overfishing and the recovery of biodiversity of certain areas.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:39):**  Now, I've heard varying degrees of efficacy on projects like this.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:43):**  I know some of them work extremely well and I know some cannot be as effective.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:48):**  What are some of the, I guess, common factors that you've seen in conservation projects  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:54):**  like this?  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:55):**  Is it a matter of the way that they're managed?  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:30:58):**  The way that they're incentivized for the people who are involved or the governments  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:01):**  that are involved?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:03):**  Is there a better approach of either offering incentives for those areas that are mostly  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:08):**  motivated by short-term profits?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:11):**  Or do you think it's more effective to have penalties and, I guess, restrictions or consequences  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:17):**  for a lack of adherence?  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:19):**  I think we need all of the above.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:21):**  There is a problem with ocean conservation.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:23):**  Well, there are three main problems, I think.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:26):**  One is that most people are not aware of the benefits of protecting areas.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:32):**  As you said before, and it seems counterintuitive, but right now only two and a half percent  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:38):**  of the ocean is fully protected from fishing, oil drilling, mining and other extractive  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:43):**  activities.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:44):**  Two and a half percent only.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:47):**  That means that 97.5% of the ocean is like a bank account where everybody withdraws,  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:55):**  but nobody makes a deposit.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:31:56):**  And you don't need to be an economist or a banker to know what's going to happen to that  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:00):**  bank account.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:02):**  These protected areas are like savings accounts with a principle that we set aside that produce  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:08):**  returns.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:10):**  And we have plenty of evidence from around the world that this works.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:14):**  But most people are not aware of the benefits and they believe that protecting areas is  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:18):**  a drain.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:19):**  Protecting areas is a restriction on their freedom to fish.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:24):**  The problem is that the big enemy of fishing is over fishing, not protected areas.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:30):**  So that's one.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:31):**  We need to do a better job educating stakeholders, ocean users about the benefits of more protection.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:39):**  Two, there is an issue of governance.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:42):**  In many, in most cases, protected areas have to be designated and managed by countries,  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:50):**  by government agencies.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:53):**  But with shrinking budgets for conservation, this is becoming more and more difficult.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:32:58):**  But there are areas where local communities have done a great job protecting the resources.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:02):**  So if we were able to transfer the authority of management of coastal areas to local communities,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:09):**  they would have a greater vested interest in keeping these places in good health.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:16):**  And the final one you alluded to is the funding, the financing of protected areas.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:22):**  We released a report on July 8th this year on the costs and benefits of protecting 30%  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:31):**  of the planet.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:33):**  And we found that the benefits of 30% protection exceed, outweigh the cost by a ratio of five  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:43):**  to one, at least.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:45):**  For every dollar invested in protected areas, nature gives us at least $5 in return.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:51):**  It is something extraordinary.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:33:54):**  This is a market, the market of nature conservation, part of which is tourism, part of which is  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:00):**  enhanced food production around these protected areas.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:05):**  The future for this sector is much brighter than sectors like agriculture, for example,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:11):**  that is growing at less than 1% or fisheries that is actually shrinking.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:16):**  Fisheries globally is a sector in recession mode.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:21):**  So if we are able to see these protected areas as good businesses, which they are, then we  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:29):**  will not see them as a drain.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:31):**  But the investments that we need to make in the beginning to create them and make sure  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:35):**  that they are well managed, they should be seen as another investment for a resilient  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:40):**  economy.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:41):**  Yeah, that's really in line with a lot of the figures that I've seen for other types  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:46):**  of ecosystem service investment.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:49):**  I just finished up with a series all about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:52):**  And though, like you said, the investment potential for conventional or industrial agriculture  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:34:57):**  is extremely low, I've been seeing things like five to seven dollars for every dollar  
**[0:35:02-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:02):**  invested in potential returns as you invest in actually repairing, restoring or regenerating  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:09):**  the ecosystems that you're trying to do business with, extract a resource or whatever.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:15):**  It can be done only up to a finite point.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:17):**  The analogy that you used with the bank account withdrawal.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:20):**  But if you look at it as an investment, as something that you build the overall health  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:24):**  of, the products that you can get out of it are a fantastic return in the long run or  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:30):**  even in the short run, depending on how that business model is run.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:34):**  But all of the side benefits turn out to help communities, to help all of the ecosystem  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:40):**  services and the species that are not particularly exploited for economic gain.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:46):**  And those in turn kind of have run on and cyclical services for the ones that you can  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:51):**  actually get a return on.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:35:54):**  Now I do really like the model of conservation and fortunately in a lot of areas, oceans  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:02):**  are ecosystems that can recover extremely quickly given the right conditions.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:08):**  But have you seen anything in these conservation models that actually help to assist the regeneration  
**[0:36:14-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:14):**  to recover faster or maybe adding something, being a proponent of a specific type of regenerative?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:23):**  I've seen models like seeding coral reefs.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:28):**  I've seen a number of different ones.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:30):**  Some people using art installations, some people using specific types of materials on  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:37):**  which different types of coral can grow in faster.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:41):**  Are you aware of many of these as kickstarters for regeneration to accelerate the process?  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:46):**  Yes, I have seen a few of these.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:51):**  You know, the ocean is so much more difficult than the land, right?  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:54):**  Because on the land we can accelerate the recovery of an ecosystem through what's called  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:36:59):**  rewilding.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:01):**  We have great examples where people have reintroduced native species, native herbivores that were  
**[0:37:08-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:08):**  gone because of too much hunting like deer or the European bison, beaver and other species.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:17):**  And these species are, the reintroduction of these species helps accelerate the restoration  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:23):**  of the ecosystem.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:25):**  In the ocean it's very difficult because it is very difficult to reintroduce species at  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:30):**  a scale that would work.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:33):**  All these projects about regenerating, trying to regenerate coral reefs, for example, they  
**[0:37:40-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:40):**  are well intentioned, but there's only one that I have seen that works.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:47):**  And in isolation, they are not going to work.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:49):**  You know, if for example, you spend millions of dollars to replant little baby cordels  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:37:57):**  in an area in the Caribbean that is one or two hectares.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:01):**  You can spend easily $1 million per hectare.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:05):**  And a hectare is nothing at the scale of the sea, right?  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:10):**  And your corals start growing.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:12):**  And then in two years you get a big hurricane or an El Nino year and your corals bleach  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:18):**  and die.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:19):**  That's it.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:20):**  Go on.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:21):**  And then the reef is going to be overgrown by algae.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:29):**  And once you have algae on the reef, seaweed on the reef, the coral larvae cannot settle.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:33):**  There is no way for the coral reef to come back.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:37):**  Now this is the scenario on a normal coral reef today.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:42):**  A normal reef means there are no large fish.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:45):**  You know, the place has been overfished.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:47):**  Now if you have a place with all of its species, including the large parrotfish that eat seaweed,  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:38:56):**  then these fish are going to keep the reef clean for the coral larvae to settle and help  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:02):**  to replenish the reef.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:05):**  So all of these efforts for them to work have to be associated with fully protected areas.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:11):**  But still, even the most successful ones, we have a problem with scaling.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:16):**  Because if it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars or $1 million to replant corals  
**[0:39:23-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:23):**  in an area of just one hectare, we don't have the resources to be able to plant corals on  
**[0:39:34-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:34):**  a scale that will make a difference.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:36):**  Sure.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:37):**  Yeah, I can see how the investment for doing work at sea is much, much higher than trying  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:42):**  to get work done like that on land.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:45):**  But you mentioned bringing in different species to certain areas.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:49):**  And some of the best examples of success have actually been bringing in apex predators like  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:39:55):**  wolves to Yellowstone, which have huge impacts on the health of the ecosystem.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:00):**  And I know you know a little bit about bringing in apex predators into marine ecosystems as  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:05):**  well.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:06):**  Can you tell me about how bringing in sharks can actually increase the overall number of  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:11):**  fish in an area?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:12):**  Yes.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:14):**  The best way for the ocean to be restored is to let it restore itself.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:21):**  We can get European bison from Poland or bears from Romania and move them to the Pyrenees.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:29):**  And that works.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:30):**  But moving sharks from one place to another doesn't work.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:35):**  Because many of the sharks migrate long distances.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:38):**  In the Mediterranean, people also try to relocate monk seals from one part to the other.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:44):**  But these animals can swim 500 kilometers in a week.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:49):**  So in the ocean, it is not, you cannot expect that if you move one animal from one place  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:56):**  to another, that animal is going to stay there.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:40:59):**  Also, we cannot reproduce species in captivity like sharks.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:03):**  Sharks have long life spans, in some cases 25, 30, 40 years.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:08):**  Some of these reef sharks that don't move so much, which would be good candidates for  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:14):**  relocation efforts.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:16):**  Most reef sharks, like gray reef sharks, for example, they don't reproduce until they reach  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:21):**  age seven.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:23):**  So reproducing these large predators in captivity to then release them in the field, it just  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:28):**  doesn't work.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:29):**  It's not practical.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:30):**  The best thing we can do, again, is to protect the large areas where they can come back.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:35):**  And they can come back pretty fast.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:38):**  And we have seen pristine reefs.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:40):**  We have been, when you think about the spectrum of ocean health from places that are pristine,  
**[0:41:47-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:47):**  full of sharks, where the coral reefs are thriving and healthy, to places that are degraded,  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:53):**  where the largest fish is a little damselfish, and everything in between.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:41:58):**  So we have seen that not only there are more sharks in the pristine places, but also there  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:04):**  are more fish of other species.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:06):**  It's like the sharks are the keystone that keeps the ecosystem together.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:15):**  We thought we went to a pristine reef for the first time in 2005.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:20):**  And I had never been to a wild uninhabited remote reef before.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:25):**  And we jumped in the water.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:27):**  And as soon as my bubbles cleared, I was surrounded by 10 rich sharks, which came to check us  
**[0:42:33-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:33):**  out.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:34):**  After a while, they got bored and they left to do their thing.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:36):**  Then you look down and there are so many fish and the corals are looking great.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:42):**  And we did studies and looked and found that the biomass, the tons of fish per hectare,  
**[0:42:48-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:48):**  the biomass of top predators in these pristine reefs is larger than the biomass of the prey.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:42:57):**  But even though there are less prey, there is still more prey than in places where people  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:03):**  fish.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:04):**  So we are more formidable predators even than sharks.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:09):**  Without question, the impact that humans are having all around the world is absolutely  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:14):**  massive.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:15):**  But it is a huge encouraging sign that with these little incentives and changes, so much  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:23):**  can happen with these ecosystems in coming back through their own regenerative processes.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:28):**  Now, you mentioned too about kind of the effects that COVID-19 and the pandemic are having  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:34):**  on our consciousness about the interconnected nature of everything that we do.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:40):**  And there's actually been a lot of hopeful things that have come out of this as well.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:44):**  And much has been made about the diminished greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:48):**  contamination being reduced during the pandemic.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:52):**  Do you see hope in what's coming out of this and some lessons that are being learned?  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:43:57):**  Or do you think as things start to begin to come back to normal, it's mostly going to  
**[0:44:03-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:03):**  be forgotten?  
**[0:44:05-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:05):**  Coming back to normal, that's the problem, right?  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:07):**  Most people would like to go back to normal, go back to where we were.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:11):**  But I think that's one of the worst things we could do.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:15):**  China is already putting more pollution in the atmosphere than pre-COVID.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:21):**  So people want to go back to normal.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:25):**  Governments want to go back to normal, which means people will consume and countries will  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:31):**  burn fossil fuels.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:33):**  And that's not what we should be looking for.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:38):**  But one thing that we have learned from this pandemic, you have seen these stories online  
**[0:44:43-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:43):**  of dolphins or even a humbug whale inside marinas and mountain lions and deer inside  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:53):**  cities when people were in lockdown.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:55):**  So it seems that nature came out from somewhere, right?  
**[0:44:59-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:44:59):**  And I think this is a great signal that nature is sending to us.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:06):**  Nature is telling us, look, if you just give me some space, look what I can do.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:13):**  Look what I can give you.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:15):**  I think that's the biggest lesson we have to take from this pandemic.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:21):**  That if we just give nature a little space, she can come back spectacularly, faster than  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:27):**  we believe and provide many more benefits to us than if we continue destroying it.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:34):**  And now in regard to the solutions that you've mentioned and the options that people have  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:38):**  available, what would you say are some of the best ways that individuals, people like  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:43):**  you or me or anybody listening to this at home, can do to actually contribute to moving  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:49):**  the culture towards a better understanding and a much more intimate respect of these  
**[0:45:55-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:45:55):**  systems and also how they interact with us, the conditions that they create for our own  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:02):**  lives and our own survivability in the long run?  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:06):**  What are some of the actions or the things that we can do ourselves on a smaller scale  
**[0:46:11-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:11):**  to help to advance these ideas?  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:14):**  To me, there is one thing that is so easy to do and it's good for you and it's good  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:19):**  for the planet, which is eat more plants.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:23):**  A plant-based diet is the best thing we could do at the individual level because plants,  
**[0:46:31-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:31):**  if we eat plants mostly, we need less surface because meat production requires so much surface  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:41):**  and so much water.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:42):**  For example, 41% of the surface of the United States, 41% is dedicated to raise livestock,  
**[0:46:52-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:52):**  mostly cows.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:54):**  41% is crazy.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:46:57):**  And cows produce less than 20% of the calories that we need.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:04):**  And people are eating too much animal protein anyway.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:07):**  And yeah, some people say, well, we need to eat protein.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:10):**  We need to eat beef.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:11):**  Well, what do beef eat?  
**[0:47:13-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:13):**  I want to be strong like a bull.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:15):**  Well, they eat grass.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:17):**  No, they eat plants.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:18):**  They just process the vitamins and proteins and other nutrients from plants.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:25):**  And we then eat the livestock and get some of them.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:30):**  So it's the most inefficient economically nonsensical way of producing food.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:37):**  So a plant-based diet would help our health, would get us all of the nutrients and protein  
**[0:47:44-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:44):**  that we need, and also would reduce dramatically the amount of CO2 and methane that livestock  
**[0:47:52-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:52):**  put in the atmosphere.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:47:54):**  Also, it would save us a lot of water because the amount of fresh water that is needed to  
**[0:48:02-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:02):**  raise a pound of beef is ridiculous.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:05):**  So that's my, we could talk about the laundry list here of things that everybody can do  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:12):**  from using LED light bulbs to using the bicycle instead of the car.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:17):**  But if there is one thing, that would be it, in my opinion, a plant-based diet.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:23):**  And I know that you're aware of certain other types of ocean regeneration techniques such  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:28):**  as the production of seaweed, I'm sure, and its ability to filter water, to create habitat  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:34):**  for animals, and to create a lot of useful products, including food that is something  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:41):**  that's the way it is now, it's not a big part of our diet.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:44):**  And it would definitely need some marketing and some change in culinary practices to make  
**[0:48:49-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:49):**  it more common.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:51):**  How do you feel about that and its potential to, I guess, bring more attention to the health  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:48:57):**  of the oceans and actually do something positive for it rather than just being a marketing  
**[0:49:01-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:01):**  campaign?  
**[0:49:02-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:02):**  Yeah, no, you are absolutely right.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:04):**  Seaweeds are wonderful.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:05):**  I studied seaweeds for many years and I love them.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:09):**  You can get more iron and more protein from seaweeds than from kale, for example.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:16):**  And yeah, they absorb CO2 from seawater, which means that they reduce the acidity of that  
**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:25):**  part of the ocean, which is benefiting all other species.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:28):**  They provide the habitat for many other species, which also we like to consume.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:35):**  And they are really, really nutritious.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:37):**  But as you said, there's a cultural barrier here.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:42):**  Most people, you think about China or Japan, they consume large amounts of seaweed.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:49):**  It's part of their culture.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:51):**  But if you here in the United States or probably in Catalonia, where you are now, if you Google  
**[0:49:59-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:49:59):**  foods that contain iron and you're going to see nuts and got a bunch of beans and lentils  
**[0:50:05-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:05):**  and beef and seaweeds are not on the list, on the top 10 list, just because it's not  
**[0:50:12-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:12):**  part of the culture.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:13):**  But there is a huge push now for including seaweed in human diet, but also in animal  
**[0:50:22-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:22):**  feed, because livestock fed with seaweed also produce much less methane.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:31):**  So seaweeds can help us mitigate climate change by absorbing CO2 from seawater, by feeding  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:40):**  us, so we don't have to use resources on the land and also by reducing the carbon footprint  
**[0:50:46-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:46):**  of livestock.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:48):**  But the most important thing is that seaweeds, you only need seawater and sun.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:54):**  We don't need fertilizers.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:56):**  We don't need fresh water.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:50:57):**  We don't need complex machinery or burning all these fossil fuels for collecting your  
**[0:51:06-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:06):**  crops.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:07):**  You know, just basically in many places, you just put ropes in the water and the seaweed  
**[0:51:13-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:13):**  spores will attach to these ropes and will grow.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:16):**  So it's the most cost efficient, one of the most cost efficient solutions we can do to  
**[0:51:22-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:22):**  help feed the world.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:24):**  It's something that I've gotten really excited about.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:25):**  And though you mentioned that it's not common in a Western diet, I think I'm a bit of an  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:29):**  exception there because I actually grew up in Japan and I've been eating seaweed ever  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:33):**  since I was a little kid.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:34):**  And it's a shame that it's not a bigger part of the diet here in Catalonia because the  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:39):**  food here is amazing.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:40):**  You know better than I do.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:41):**  The Mediterranean diet is an example all around the world.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:44):**  And to include some seaweed in that would probably be just like the thing that tops  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:50):**  it off as a healthy diet for anyone to follow.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:54):**  Well that's a good business for you there.  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:56):**  There we go.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:57):**  I'm not quite that close to the ocean.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:51:59):**  I'm closer to the mountains but it's not far off.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:03):**  It's a 30 minute drive.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:05):**  So let's take an opportunity now to talk a little bit about your book, The Nature of  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:09):**  Nature and Why We Need the Wild.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:12):**  We talked so much about rewilding in a case of conservation and allowing ecosystems to  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:18):**  recover on their own.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:20):**  Tell me a little bit more about some of the major points that you go through in this book.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:24):**  And how it reinforces that idea.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:26):**  Yeah this book is my love letter to the planet.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:32):**  It's a book where I use stories of my own stories and stories of fellow ecologists who  
**[0:52:40-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:40):**  discovered key principles in ecology of how nature works.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:46):**  In 20 years ago, eight people were locked in a futuristic construction building in the  
**[0:52:57-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:57):**  desert of Arizona.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:52:59):**  They were supposed to live together without any contact from the outside world.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:05):**  And they tried to reproduce the earth's ecosystems.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:10):**  A little coral reef, a little wetland, tropical forest.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:15):**  So they were supposed to be completely self-contained.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:19):**  But it didn't work.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:22):**  The experiment failed and after a year they had to open the valves to let oxygen get in  
**[0:53:28-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:28):**  because the ecosystems that they tried to recreate collapsed.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:32):**  So we are not able to create an ecosystem to support eight people.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:39):**  So how can nature do it?  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:41):**  We have nine species, sorry nine million species of plants and animals.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:46):**  A trillion different types of microbes.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:48):**  They all interconnect and interdepend.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:51):**  And it works.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:52):**  It works.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:53):**  It's been working for us for 200,000 years.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:55):**  Which is fine.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:53:57):**  So it is this fascination about the workings of nature, the nature of nature that if we  
**[0:54:02-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:02):**  understand how wonderful, how astonishing and complex the machinery of nature is, it  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:11):**  will be very clear that it's an engine that works and keeps us alive.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:16):**  It's our life support system.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:17):**  Let's not tamper with it.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:20):**  Removing species.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:21):**  This may seem, removing one of nine million species may not seem like a problem, but it  
**[0:54:27-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:27):**  could have dire consequences for us.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:30):**  Eating one species in China has had tremendous consequences for the entire world.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:36):**  So this book is a way for me to make people fall in love, be fascinated, have developed  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:45):**  a sense of awe and wonder about the baroque of nature, of how nature works.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:50):**  And of course, making the case for protection of at least 30% of the planet.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:54:56):**  And I'm making the ecological, scientific case, an economic case showing why protection  
**[0:55:02-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:02):**  of 30% of the planet would produce a larger economic output than a world with no more  
**[0:55:09-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:09):**  protected areas.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:11):**  Making the mortal case because nature is not something that is out there to serve us.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:18):**  We are not the masters of the universe.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:19):**  We're just one more citizen of the biosphere.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:23):**  And that was supposed to be the book, but then the pandemic happened and I was able  
**[0:55:27-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:27):**  to stop the book, the book going to the printer and write one final chapter on the nature  
**[0:55:34-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:34):**  of coronavirus.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:36):**  Making the case for our broken relationship with nature as the cause of this pandemic  
**[0:55:43-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:43):**  and the cause of other global crisis.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:46):**  But the good news is that we know we have so many examples of these miracles happening  
**[0:55:51-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:51):**  all around the world.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:52):**  If we give nature space, she will come back and she will take care of us.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:55:59):**  Very well said.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:00):**  Well, Anurag, before I let you go, can you tell our listeners how they can get themselves  
**[0:56:05-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:05):**  a copy of your book and where they can find out more information about your organization  
**[0:56:09-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:09):**  Pristine Seas and some of your previous work?  
**[0:56:12-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:12):**  Yes, for Pristine Seas, you can go to pristineseas.org.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:20):**  And there you will be able to find information of the 30 places that we have visited in the  
**[0:56:24-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:24):**  last decade with photographs, videos and maps of the protected areas that we have helped  
**[0:56:30-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:30):**  to create.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:31):**  And the nature of nature of the book is coming out on August 25th, but you can already pre-order  
**[0:56:38-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:38):**  everywhere online.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:40):**  I'm not going to publicize one specific online bookstore, but everywhere online where books  
**[0:56:48-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:48):**  are sold, you can find the nature of nature now.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:51):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:52):**  Well, I tell you, it has been an absolute pleasure and I really agree with these ideas  
**[0:56:57-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:56:57):**  that you're advancing in such an important time when people really need to make this  
**[0:57:01-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:57:01):**  connection about the impacts that are happening, the way it's clearly affecting all of our  
**[0:57:05-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:57:05):**  lives and how it all comes back to the way that we are managing, interacting and seeing  
**[0:57:11-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:57:11):**  ourselves as a part of the ecosystems that make up this entire planet.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:57:17):**  So thank you so much for taking the time.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:57:19):**  Buona tarda from Catalunya and I hope we can stay in touch.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:57:24):**  Thank you so much Oliver.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:57:25):**  Muchas gracias.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/enric-sala/#t=0:57:26):**  All right, that wraps things up for this week's episode.

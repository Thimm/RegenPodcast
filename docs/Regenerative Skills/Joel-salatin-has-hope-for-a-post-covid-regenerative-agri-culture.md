**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:40):**  If you're like me, you're bogged down in the tsunami of information online about ecological  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:45):**  design, techniques for best practice, and how and what to implement first.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:50):**  There are some articles and blogs that have supporting information and some that conflict,  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:54):**  and it's really tough to tell what's right or what's right for you.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:00:58):**  The truth is, until you have a framework to guide you through all of this noise, more  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:01:02):**  information can just serve to paralyze your progress.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:01:05):**  And that's why I want to tell you about something exciting that I've been working  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:01:07):**  on with ecosystem restoration camps.

**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:01:15):**  restoration who will walk you through five modules designed to explain the most essential  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:01:19):**  information to get you moving forward on your regenerative project right away.

**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:01:52):**  Seeing as most of us need to be social distancing right now, you can work through all five modules  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:01:57):**  from the comfort of your home, or just choose the modules that you would like to take based  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:01):**  on your own interests and budget.

**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:27):**  Imagine that this quarantine could be the time that you used to create a restoration  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:31):**  plan for your land that launches you into amazing action when it's over.

**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:38):**  I can't wait to see you on the course.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:42):**  My guest today needs little introduction.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:45):**  Joel Salatin has been one of the most prominent voices in regenerative agriculture for many  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:50):**  years now, and I thought he'd be the perfect person to not only kick off this new series  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:54):**  on regenerative agriculture, but also for his optimistic perspective on the future that  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:02:59):**  we're collectively heading into as our country continues to grapple with the social and economic  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:03):**  costs of the COVID-19 pandemic and its response.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:08):**  Though I'd always planned to speak with Joel about the future and opportunities in regenerative  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:11):**  farming in the US and around the world, I had no idea just how relevant these topics  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:16):**  would be as we find ourselves questioning the future of just about every industry and  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:20):**  its environmental impact at this unique moment in history.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:25):**  Though many of us are looking at the bleak predictions of the world economy and all the  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:28):**  other looming catastrophes that involve everything from our environment to the food supply system,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:33):**  we are also seeing an unprecedented review of priorities and focus.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:38):**  In this episode, Joel and I discuss how this crisis has affected the farming industry at  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:42):**  large, but also the incredible impact it's had on small local farmers.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:47):**  He tells me a bit about how he sees this event as a blessing if it's managed correctly, and  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:52):**  if we use it as one.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:54):**  Joel also gives details about how his own farm is adapting to the restrictions and finding  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:03:58):**  opportunities to bring his community closer and connect them with other local producers  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:02):**  in the area.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:04):**  We also muse over the likely changes that our culture will experience for a long time  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:08):**  in the wake of this, and what the good and worrisome aspects likely are.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:13):**  In the end though, I left this chat feeling inspired and much more optimistic than I was  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:18):**  before, and I hope that's how you feel by the end too.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:21):**  So now I'll hand things over to the lunatic farmer himself, Joel Salatin.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:25):**  Hey Joel, thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me again.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:29):**  We find ourselves in an interesting situation globally right now.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:33):**  How are things where you are in Virginia?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:35):**  Well, it depends on if you're in the country or in the city.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:38):**  It certainly does.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:40):**  It certainly does.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:42):**  Out here on the farm, we have to pinch ourselves to actually watch the news to realize that  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:48):**  anything's going on.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:50):**  The cows are calving, the chicks are coming, the hens are laying eggs, the tomatoes are  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:56):**  growing.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:04:58):**  We're spreading compost.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:01):**  The bees are coming, the blossoms are blooming, and life goes on here on the farm.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:09):**  It's a wonderful balm, if you will, a salve in a time of unprecedented calamity, at least  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:17):**  in my lifetime.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:19):**  And to be able to be here in this womb of consistency and normalcy is truly a calming  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:31):**  thing.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:32):**  Well, that's just it, isn't it?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:34):**  This is a major crisis, but it's a very selective one, and it is not either affecting everyone  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:39):**  nor every living being equally.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:41):**  And from all the farmers that I've talked to and the ones that I've collaborated with  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:45):**  in the past that I've been in touch with, it's business is normal for them as far as  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:49):**  their day-to-day tasks, but certainly there are some changes in the market.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:05:54):**  Now, I mean, there seems to be a lot of cause of concern for leadership around the world,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:01):**  but there at the same time seems to be a lot of good coming out of this sudden and drastic  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:06):**  reordering of our society and our economy with people being more focused, it seems,  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:11):**  on their communities and their self-sufficiency.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:13):**  So my question is, have you seen many examples of this in the farming sector and in your  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:18):**  own community?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:20):**  Yes, actually a lot.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:25):**  They say that a crisis does not create a trend.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:28):**  It simply either accelerates a trend that's already developing or it brings into a clearer  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:39):**  focus a trend that's already developing.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:42):**  And so a couple of really specific things that we've seen with our farm in the last  
**[0:06:50-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:50):**  three weeks is an exponential interest and growth and purchasing of backyard chickens.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:06:58):**  You know, three, four chickens for a backyard flock.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:01):**  I'm going to have eggs.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:05):**  And of course in the U.S. now, literally hatcheries, all independent hatcheries are backlogged  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:12):**  up to three months.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:13):**  You can't buy a chick in the U.S. now.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:16):**  They're all ordered and snarfed up.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:20):**  Even the New York Times is writing about this.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:24):**  In the media parlance, it's called a phenom.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:27):**  It's a phenom, this new trend.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:32):**  So yeah, that certainly speaks right to your self-reliance that people are engaging in  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:37):**  this.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:38):**  And of course we think this is a great thing.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:40):**  Another huge thing that's happening is all of the little independent seed companies,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:45):**  especially that sell heirloom seeds or non-chemicalized seeds.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:49):**  They are also, in fact, many of them have shut down their websites for three days just  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:07:57):**  to be able to breathe and catch up with orders.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:01):**  That has developed as well.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:04):**  And again, I think that there's going to be more gardens put in this year than we've seen  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:13):**  probably since the World War II Victory Gardens back at that time.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:19):**  That also is a very, very good trend.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:21):**  There are some real positive things going on.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:24):**  Undoubtedly.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:25):**  It seems like for every goofball who's loading up on toilet paper, there's a good two or  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:29):**  three who've got their priorities straight and they're looking to get chickens and seeds.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:34):**  Well, yeah, I think that the physics, for every action there's an equal opposite reaction.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:40):**  I think that that certainly exists.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:47):**  There's definitely a new sense of, I'll just call it, the English language is so wonderful  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:55):**  because we can just hang things on words.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:08:58):**  And so I call it home-centricity.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:09:01):**  Coming home, there's definitely, as people are forced to come home, they are then forced  
**[0:09:08-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:09:08):**  to find their entertainment, their satisfaction, their life affirmation in a more home-centric  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:09:18):**  model.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:09:20):**  And so my hope from this would be that people would find as much, whatever, personal fulfillment  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:09:30):**  value in, for example, growing a garden as going on a Disney vacation or a Caribbean  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:09:38):**  cruise.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:09:40):**  Not that I hate Disney or hate Caribbean cruises.  
**[0:09:44-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:09:44):**  I just think that as a percentage of GDP, our culture has moved toward frivolous entertainment  
**[0:10:00-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:00):**  for those time and dollars, as opposed to, well, I'll just call it meaningful entertainment,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:08):**  which could be anything from putting together a family doing a theater night, let the kids  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:15):**  do a marionette show or something, or community.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:20):**  I mean, I think of back 100 years ago, communities would, for example, get together and have  
**[0:10:31-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:31):**  a community spelling bee or perhaps a public debate over some pressing issue and have two  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:39):**  actors who would take the part of one side or the other just to bring something.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:44):**  And people did this.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:46):**  They didn't have TV, they didn't have Netflix, they didn't have all this other stuff.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:51):**  And so they manufactured their own entertainment.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:10:57):**  And this quarantine, this imposed home centricity, I think, is bringing out some of these nostalgic,  
**[0:11:14-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:14):**  pre-modern ways of finding your creativity and your theatrical talents and those sorts  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:29):**  of things.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:30):**  I think those are all very good things.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:33):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:35):**  I'm going back to a lot of the things that entertained me when I was a kid.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:39):**  And I guess the bigger question now is, do you think that this is going to continue?  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:45):**  Is this going to last once the easements on social distancing and the crisis of the epidemic  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:50):**  starts to subside?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:52):**  Well that's the big question, isn't it?  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:55):**  We have no way of knowing.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:11:57):**  But I can tell you based, I mean, again, we live in this Jekyll and Hyde world.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:04):**  We live out here on the farm, but we direct market.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:07):**  So every day, our delivery drivers are, not every day, but most days, our delivery drivers  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:15):**  are in the city, in the belly of the beast in the city.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:21):**  And it's interesting the things that we're hearing.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:23):**  I can tell you that the shock of this is going to make people fearful of crowds for a long,  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:34):**  long time.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:35):**  Yeah, it does seem that way.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:37):**  And I mean, Disney is talking about, if you go to Disney, in addition to going through  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:44):**  baggage security as you go in the front gate, they very well may require you to take your  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:51):**  temperature going in.  
**[0:12:52-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:12:52):**  I mean, that seems like a crazy world to those of us who are a little bit older.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:02):**  But if going into public spaces, if going into crowded spaces becomes way more laborious,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:12):**  I mean, look at how people have flocked to the TSA to pre-check.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:18):**  Yeah, I was just about to say, yeah, how much we put up with the fly.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:24):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:25):**  And it's like me that fly, at least we used to fly routinely, you know, we're glad to  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:33):**  go pay $100 and get fingerprinted and background checked, just to not have the hassle of going  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:40):**  through the regular line at the TSA.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:44):**  If that becomes normal in stadiums and in graduation ceremonies, in Las Vegas entertainment  
**[0:13:56-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:13:56):**  shows, and theater venues and things like that, the hassle factor, I think the hassle  
**[0:14:05-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:14:05):**  factor and the fear factor among people is going to linger for a very, very long time.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:14:17):**  Which means that there will be an atomization, a decentralization, we could even say a democratization  
**[0:14:26-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:14:26):**  of the pastimes, the hobbies, the entertainment, the recreational venues are going to be downsized,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:14:39):**  they're going to be more community oriented, they're going to be smaller groups of people.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:14:44):**  I mean, I don't think we're going to be taking temperatures at weddings and funerals  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:14:48):**  and things.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:14:49):**  And there will certainly be a number, you know.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:14:54):**  I'm comfortable in a room full of 400 people or 500 people.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:00):**  But I think that the day when people are going to just without any care at all, go to an  
**[0:15:07-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:07):**  80,000 seat stadium, I think that that's going to take years to come back.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:18):**  I really do.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:19):**  I mean, we see it in our customers, you know, out here on the farm, obviously, we're not  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:24):**  wearing gloves or masks or anything, we're with the cows and the chickens and all that  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:29):**  stuff.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:30):**  But I'll tell you, folks, folks that are great customers that we service in the urban  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:35):**  sector where they're pinned up in their apartments, they're getting 24 seven hysterical  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:42):**  news feeds.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:44):**  And they've been told 2 million of us are going to die and then 200,000 are going to  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:49):**  die.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:50):**  Now I think it's down to 60,000 going to die.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:15:52):**  And we're just living in this barrage, daily barrage of doomsday.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:05):**  It's taking the bounce out of people, it's taking the starch out of people.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:10):**  And I hate to see it on their faces.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:13):**  They're scared, they're frustrated, they're depressed.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:19):**  It's a big deal.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:21):**  And so I can tell you, I've talked to some people who say as soon as things get lifted  
**[0:16:27-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:27):**  from travel, and as things start to ease off, literally hundreds of thousands of people  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:37):**  will get out of the cities.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:39):**  If there's a couple big demographic things that are developing from this, one is if there's  
**[0:16:48-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:48):**  one place you don't want to be in a cultural shock of any kind, it's in the city.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:16:56):**  And so distance work.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:03):**  So this is pushing two things.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:05):**  One is people are desperate to get out of the city.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:07):**  They're looking for, I mean, I have a nephew in New York.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:11):**  He's an actor.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:15):**  And guess what?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:16):**  On Tuesday of this week, he got his little shotgun motorcycle out of mothballs and fled  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:23):**  the city.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:24):**  And he's here living in a quarantining here in a barn on the farm.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:29):**  We haven't seen him.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:30):**  He's been here for three days.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:31):**  And he's got a little tent.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:32):**  He's up in the barn there and sleeping in the hay.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:35):**  And he's going to self-quarantine for two weeks.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:42):**  Jurassic Times call for Jurassic measures.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:44):**  You know, I'm sure there's a lot of people who could sympathize with that desire to get  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:49):**  out of these centers right now.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:50):**  And like you were saying, there does seem like there's going to be sort of collective  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:17:55):**  anxiety that is going to linger a lot longer than perhaps the symptoms of the disease and  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:00):**  how that's going to transform our economy and the way that we interact.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:03):**  Like you said, the social gatherings could be impacted.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:06):**  But I like your observations, too, that this could lead to more of a home centralization  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:15):**  or focus on the community in general and realizing that so much of what we need and what we desire  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:22):**  can be met in our communities if we kind of focus to redevelop the centers once again  
**[0:18:27-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:27):**  and not always rely on these external and far away versions of entertainment or sustenance.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:36):**  Yes.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:38):**  And I use the word atomization.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:41):**  I mean, to imagine everything that right now is celebrity status, basically, you know,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:53):**  from Caribbean cruises to Hollywood to Las Vegas, whatever.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:18:59):**  Imagine all of that being community sized, downsized and atomized so that the venues  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:07):**  are smaller.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:08):**  There are way more participants.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:12):**  That's kind of cool.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:14):**  And all of that is a huge thing.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:17):**  I can tell you that in the food sector, certainly, there is a renewed disenfranchisement with  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:29):**  the supermarket.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:31):**  Every single direct market farmer that I've talked to in the United States, and even in  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:35):**  Australia and Europe, but every one of us that's actually selling into a local clientele,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:41):**  whether it's through farmers markets, CSAs, on farm stores, you know, delivery, you know,  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:51):**  community delivery, all of those combinations, including internet sales, those of us who  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:19:57):**  are shipping and we're selling across, but any farmer who's direct marketing, I mean,  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:05):**  for us personally, we're having the best spring we've ever had in history.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:11):**  Our inventory is way down.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:13):**  But here's what's happened.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:15):**  The just in time inventory of the large scale supermarkets means that any given city only  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:22):**  has three days worth of food in it.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:25):**  That's it.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:27):**  People don't stockpile food in their homes.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:29):**  They assume that the supermarket will stockpile it, but the supermarket is not stockpiling  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:33):**  it.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:34):**  It's doing just in time inventory from the warehouse, which is doing just in time inventory  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:38):**  from the processing facility, which is doing just in time inventory from wherever they're  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:44):**  happening to get it from around the world.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:47):**  And the result of that is that when there is a shock like this, there's nothing behind  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:54):**  the screen.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:20:57):**  And so what's happened here is that those of us who direct market, who direct farmers,  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:03):**  who direct market, we do stockpile.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:06):**  We don't do just in time inventory because we don't have a warehouse.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:10):**  We don't just, oh, I'm short of green beans.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:13):**  I'll call up Peru and see if I can get a shipment of green beans from Peru today.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:20):**  We actually do stockpile.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:22):**  We don't do just in time.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:23):**  And so as the store shelves emptied, suddenly we local farmers with our stash of stuff that  
**[0:21:33-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:33):**  we keep for three months, if a fox gets in the chickens or if there's a drought and we're  
**[0:21:41-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:41):**  short of crop, our stockpile became the substitute for the inability of the industrial food system  
**[0:21:53-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:21:53):**  to be nimble enough to be able to get material fast enough for how it was leaving the shelves.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:03):**  We've had people now come to us both on our farm store and online and sales and things  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:09):**  that have told us, you know, A, they will never go back to the supermarket.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:13):**  B, they have come to us for the first time in their lives because they couldn't find  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:22):**  it at the store, at the supermarket.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:26):**  And frankly, they are concerned about long chains of custody.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:33):**  They're concerned about a food system that is resilient, a food system that's nimble  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:39):**  enough.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:40):**  And what they're seeing is, talking to their friends and neighbors and stuff, well, these  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:46):**  direct brand farmers, that's where the stuff is.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:51):**  And so we think, now, how many of these will stay with us after the crisis is over?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:22:59):**  Nobody can say.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:00):**  But as my son Daniel and I were talking the other day, goodness, if we just keep 10% of  
**[0:23:08-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:08):**  the new interest in authentic local foods that has come during this shock, it's going  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:18):**  to be a major bump, like a doubling of sales going forward.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:24):**  Yeah, and I've observed that here in Europe as well.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:28):**  I mean, my partner and I, we were already buying directly from a farm not far from here.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:33):**  And it's been incredible to watch how small outfits like yours, like the one here in Spain  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:39):**  where I live, have been nimble enough to change their marketing and their business model on  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:45):**  the fly.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:46):**  They went from having an open market to selling everything ahead of time online.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:53):**  You pay with a credit card.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:23:54):**  And when you show up, they just load a box of your purchases into your trunk, and you  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:00):**  drive off with it without any interactions.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:02):**  Now, obviously, that's not ideal in the long term, but it's shown an incredible resilience  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:06):**  from these small producers to be able to meet the needs of even such an anomaly of an event  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:12):**  like this.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:13):**  And it's been extremely inspiring to say.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:15):**  Like what you observed with, you know, even if it's just a matter of keeping 10% of this  
**[0:24:20-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:20):**  increased clientele base, this could really be the event that changes and creates a ground  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:28):**  swell that really transforms the food industry all around the world.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:33):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:35):**  I'll tell you one little story from what happened here.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:39):**  So we live in a very rural area.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:42):**  Even though we're on the east coast, the eastern part of the US, our farm is, you know, we're  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:47):**  on the dirt road.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:50):**  We're 100 miles from a city of, you know, 100,000 people.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:24:55):**  So we're, you know, we're not urban by any means.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:00):**  So our city, which is 10 miles away, is a city of about, you know, 19 to 20,000 people.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:08):**  So it's big enough to have everything you want, but it's not, it would certainly not  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:14):**  be called, it doesn't have a rush hour, you know, it's not an urban place.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:19):**  Well, it has a farmer's market.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:22):**  And the farmer's market has been operating for, you know, 25, 30 years.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:27):**  And so the governor closed all the farmer's markets in Virginia, because he said they  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:32):**  were non-essential businesses.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:34):**  Yeah, I heard about that.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:36):**  Yeah, and of course, you know, from our standpoint, it was just ludicrous that it's safer and  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:44):**  healthier to go shop at Walmart than it is at an open air farmer's market.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:50):**  But be that as it may, Wendy, my personal assistant and a friend of hers, a cheese crafter  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:25:59):**  here in the area, the two of them got together.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:02):**  So what can we do about this?  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:05):**  And they brainstorm an idea.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:06):**  They said, well, could we start a local food drive-through?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:11):**  And so because we had a restaurant that was, they were out of business because the restaurants  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:15):**  were closed.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:17):**  So they had a vacant parking lot.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:19):**  And so literally, from, I'm pointing out how nimble small can be, it's a lot easier  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:27):**  to turn a speedboat than an aircraft carrier.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:30):**  And so these two gals, Wendy and Luella, conceived of this local food drive-through 48 hours  
**[0:26:38-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:38):**  later.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:39):**  I mean, within two days, they launched it at this local, at this parking lot, created  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:45):**  an online platform.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:48):**  We were one of four.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:49):**  We had us, we had a produce grower, a baker, and a cheesemaker.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:54):**  So the four of us went together.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:26:56):**  We launched this thing in 48 hours.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:00):**  It is already, and we're in our third week now, it has already generated way more money  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:09):**  than the farmer's market, than the whole 30-year-old farmer's market did in its peak every week.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:17):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:18):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:19):**  And so people order online.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:22):**  They literally drive up.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:23):**  They roll their window down.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:24):**  We have all their orders are prepackaged in alphabetical order.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:30):**  Hi, I'm Mary Smith.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:35):**  And we grab her bag.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:38):**  She rolls her window down.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:39):**  We toss it in the car.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:41):**  She drives on.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:42):**  We don't touch.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:44):**  We don't do anything.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:45):**  It's a 15-second transition.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:48):**  And the folks are loving it.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:27:51):**  For the first time, we feel like we have a credible local alternative to Walmart curbside  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:00):**  service.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:02):**  And if nothing more than that comes out of this pandemic, it will have been worth it.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:08):**  Because now there are communities all across the country that are duplicating this effort  
**[0:28:13-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:13):**  to the same effect, and it could literally revolutionize the convenience of a local food  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:26):**  transfer, local food interface.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:28):**  It absolutely could.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:29):**  And it seems like this is better than being able to frequent the stores that we were used  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:36):**  to before.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:37):**  The level of service, the level of quality.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:39):**  You may have to adapt to certain days when it's open or not, but you don't even have  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:44):**  to spend a fraction of the time that you used to having to go and pick out your stuff at  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:48):**  the store.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:49):**  Or even if for some reason you didn't like meandering around the farmer's market, the  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:53):**  convenience factor is incredible.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:55):**  Yes, it is.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:28:59):**  So think about the savings on both parties.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:02):**  So the farmer gets to save time by not having to, and I don't want to say this as a total  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:12):**  negative, but let me tell you as a farmer who direct markets, the direct interaction  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:18):**  with every single customer, it takes a lot of time.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:23):**  It takes a lot of time.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:24):**  And you look at the other day, well, we took in $1,000 and we spent eight hours cheating  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:30):**  and chatting with customers.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:34):**  It's a meanwhile, the chickens need to be watered and the green beans needed to be weeded  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:39):**  and the spinach need to be picked.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:42):**  And so there's this tension as a direct market farmer, the cost of babysitting customers  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:51):**  is a huge deal.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:52):**  Whereas online, we can communicate our messaging that we want to, we can inform, we can educate,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:29:59):**  we can say, come out to the farm and visit anytime you want to.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:02):**  I may not talk to you, but we're open, you're welcome to come and see what we're doing.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:11):**  But it kind of moves this kind of handholding babysitting time, which is real to a farmer,  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:23):**  it moves it to a more efficient place.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:25):**  For the buyer, for the consumer, it means that they can shop on their own time, in their  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:33):**  pajamas at midnight if they want to.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:38):**  They can shop easily.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:41):**  And on their way home from work, they just stop by, it throws in their car and they go  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:49):**  home and it's more convenient than anything they can imagine too.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:54):**  So both parties can come together when they want to.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:30:59):**  That's why we want transparent farms, we want open public access farms.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:07):**  That's the ultimate audit of authenticity.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:12):**  But at the same time, we desperately need more efficient interfaces, more efficient  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:23):**  interfaces to be able to transact business.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:26):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:27):**  And the thing is, it seems like it's these smaller producers and not only, you know,  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:33):**  we're talking about size or scale, but these tend also to be the same people who tend towards  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:38):**  regenerative agricultural methods.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:40):**  I mean, you're not seeing a huge line outside of your mono crop, wheat and corn and soy  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:46):**  farms at the same time.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:48):**  And it seems like regenerative farmers focus on resilience through diversification in their  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:52):**  business model and by investing in the health of their ecologies that they interact with  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:31:58):**  is really starting to pay off.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:00):**  And like you've been doing this on your farm for a good few decades now.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:04):**  How have those priorities begun to pay you back?  
**[0:32:08-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:08):**  Yeah, well, for sure, having a multiple group of production, you know, where we're not just  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:20):**  beef or pork, we're, you know, we've got, we tend to, we're obviously concentrated in  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:26):**  livestock.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:28):**  But we have, you know, turkey, chicken, pork, lamb, beef, duck, you know, there's this very  
**[0:32:36-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:36):**  broad portfolio because what happens pretty quickly when you begin direct marketing, very  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:44):**  quickly you realize that the big cost is in acquiring a customer.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:50):**  And so once you have a customer, that customer wants to get as big a variety as possible,  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:55):**  the one stop shop.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:32:56):**  I mean, that's a very appropriate thing.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:01):**  And so simply trying to serve your customers moves you to either produce more variety or  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:12):**  partner up with somebody nearby who does complimentary things.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:17):**  So we've now partnered with a grass based dairy that's doing a wonderful cheese line.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:26):**  So we're selling his cheese, we're teamed up with a local outfit that makes kimchi,  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:33):**  all sorts of ferments, sauerkraut, kimchi, that sort of thing.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:36):**  Another one that does kombucha, they have a live kombucha culture, and they do a wonderful  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:42):**  kombucha.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:43):**  There's two ladies in the community that are great in the kitchen, and they're now using  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:53):**  our chicken necks and backs and things and making stock, heavy vegetable soups and stews  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:33:59):**  and things like that, that we can sell as well.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:02):**  So we're collaborating with another guy that got us into a guy that makes jerky.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:11):**  And so now we have snack sticks, we have pork and beef snack sticks, different flavors,  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:17):**  and high protein snack sticks, like to complement our hot dogs that we have made.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:23):**  And so what happens is that as you build this customer base, customers start asking, well,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:35):**  do you have this?  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:36):**  Do you have this?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:37):**  Do you have this?  
**[0:34:38-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:38):**  And so if you can take this handful of customers and turn them from spending $400 a year to  
**[0:34:48-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:48):**  spending $1,000 a year, that is the cheapest, most efficient way to grow your business,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:34:59):**  not by acquiring new customers necessarily, but simply by serving a larger percentage  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:35:05):**  of the portfolio that those customers are purchasing, which pushes you into either diversifying  
**[0:35:12-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:35:12):**  your production or diversifying your portfolio through partnership, or in our case, both.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:35:20):**  And the bottom line is that it simply brings production into a community that the community  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:35:30):**  maybe wouldn't ordinarily have.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:35:34):**  We're starting to realize that, well, just because Idaho grows good potatoes does not  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:35:39):**  mean that every potato in the country should come from Idaho.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:35:45):**  And so in our area, maybe we don't grow potatoes as easily as they do in Idaho, but there is  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:35:54):**  a resilience value in acquiring potatoes nearby than everybody in the country being dependent  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:02):**  on potatoes from Idaho.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:05):**  And I think that this shock has actually moved that discussion.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:13):**  That discussion is now penetrating the business community and a lot more average consumers  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:22):**  than it did three months ago, and that's a good thing.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:25):**  It absolutely is.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:27):**  It also seems it's coming at this amazing time when we have the technology to facilitate  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:32):**  this, right?  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:33):**  I mean, not only is it fairly cheap to travel and you can get out to a farm without much  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:37):**  difficulty, but we have all of these online tools to facilitate the ease of transactions  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:43):**  and the convenience factor that otherwise larger businesses used to hold a monopoly  
**[0:36:48-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:48):**  on.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:49):**  Now these smaller producers can compete on an almost equal playing field.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:36:55):**  Yes, the technology in both online selling, which is literally new in the last, I'm just  
**[0:37:07-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:07):**  going to say basically the last 20 years, the platforms for online shopping carts have  
**[0:37:15-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:15):**  really finessed to a place where even a small outfit like us can actually have a platform  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:23):**  like this that works with a minimum of glitches.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:29):**  That's extremely powerful.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:31):**  And secondly, the distribution capacity.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:35):**  Now of course that's dominated right now by the big players, Amazon, UPS, and FedEx.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:45):**  Those are the great big players.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:47):**  But what we're seeing now in our communities, we're now collaborating with numerous smaller  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:37:56):**  distribution services that are more regional or even localized.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:01):**  Some of them are what we lovingly call a man in a van.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:06):**  It rhymes real well in English, so we use it, but a man in a van.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:10):**  This is simply a person with a delivery van who acts as a kind of a courier and just moves  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:19):**  product in small volumes, but not very far.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:25):**  Maybe won't go more than 80 or 90 miles, maybe 100 miles at the max.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:33):**  And if you have a one or one and a half ton van that you can fill and you can put that  
**[0:38:41-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:41):**  thing on the road, I know several people in our area that are doing this or very, very  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:49):**  small little box trucks, little pup trucks.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:38:56):**  And so there's now just a burgeoning kind of local duplication, what was developed globally.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:06):**  And this is my favorite part of the whole thing.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:09):**  All of this logistics in online selling, online distribution, all that sort of thing, it's  
**[0:39:16-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:16):**  all developed by the big outfits, but their innovations and their platforms trickle down.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:24):**  And so now we can, as small operators, we can glom on to their big technology investments  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:36):**  and localize what they did for globalization.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:40):**  Now we are co-opting and localizing it.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:44):**  And to me, that's like the ultimate smack down.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:51):**  Yeah, I mean, it's so exciting that things like this are coming out of an event that  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:39:57):**  it's hard to see the silver lining on, but you just have to kind of look at where the  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:01):**  priorities of the average person are starting to go to in this time of crisis.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:06):**  And it seems like people have their priorities fairly well figured out.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:10):**  Now we've been talking a lot about the business models and how those have changed drastically,  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:16):**  but let's talk a little bit about the root causes of this pandemic, which of course our  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:20):**  environmental degradation and factory farming of both wild and domestic animals.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:27):**  This is how you get those zoonotic viruses hopping from animals to humans in these close  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:32):**  contact unsanitary markets and production facilities.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:37):**  Do you worry that if a vaccine or a treatment is found quickly, that collectively we may  
**[0:40:44-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:44):**  forget to focus on the real solutions for sort of the band-aid fixes of making this go away temporarily?  
**[0:40:52-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:40:52):**  Well there's certainly the temptation for that, and if you're a pessimist, that's probably  
**[0:41:01-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:01):**  the way to bet, because we humans have worshiped at the altar of our cleverness for a very, very long time.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:11):**  That's a good way of putting it.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:14):**  And while you and I look at this as a very humbling experience, you're exactly right.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:24):**  If some vaccine is developed, instead of being a humbling experience, it could be hubris  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:32):**  on steroids.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:35):**  And oh, look at what we did.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:37):**  We beat back this terrible contagion with our cleverness and our vaccines.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:45):**  So it's hard to speculate where it will go, but our track record as a species, our track  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:41:58):**  record tends to be toward hubris and not humility.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:03):**  I'll just say that.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:05):**  Indeed.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:06):**  Yeah, it seems like with this renewed focus on local production, healthy production of  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:14):**  food, reliance on community and such, it might be a really good argument to make to start  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:20):**  to at least shrink the influence of these destructive farming models and certainly the  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:26):**  way animals are kept and treated around the world.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:29):**  But you know, like we just talked about, there is the possibility that it could kind of blow  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:34):**  over if we get sort of a Band-Aid solution too fast.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:39):**  Now, from a simple resilience perspective, now that we're starting to have this conversation  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:46):**  around who is and who is not an essential worker, do you think, and I have an idea of  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:52):**  where you might go with this, do you think it's more important to work to make yourself  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:42:57):**  an essential worker in this economic system or to make yourself independent of it as much  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:43:02):**  as possible?  
**[0:43:03-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:43:03):**  Oh, that's a good question.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:43:06):**  In general, I think that the most protected vocations that you can move toward right now  
**[0:43:25-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:43:25):**  are skills-based.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:43:26):**  So if you can grow something, repair something or build something, if you know how to build  
**[0:43:35-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:43:35):**  something, repair something or grow something, in general, society will always need you,  
**[0:43:45-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:43:45):**  especially as we move into white-collar vocational themes.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:43:54):**  And these kinds of shocks always stimulate interest in, well, in self-reliance, in practical  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:08):**  skills.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:10):**  Interestingly, the one store in our area that throughout this has remained shoulder to shoulder  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:21):**  crowded, I haven't actually been in it, but I've talked to people who were in it, it's  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:27):**  Lowe's.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:28):**  It's the home improvement store.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:31):**  Everybody is working on home improvement projects.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:34):**  They're putting on decks, they're putting on whatever.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:38):**  They're making raised garden beds, they're putting on the bathroom they never did or  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:44):**  ripping up the floor and redoing the carpet.  
**[0:44:49-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:44:49):**  And so the whole, again, this is coming back home to focusing our energy and attention  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:45:00):**  on home.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:45:02):**  We have spent, arguably, 60 years, 70 years creating a persona in our culture in which  
**[0:45:21-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:45:21):**  life happens outside the home, away from the home, and home is simply a pit stop between  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:45:29):**  all the important things in life.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:45:33):**  And a shock like this, where people are turning homeward, turning familial, turning inward  
**[0:45:43-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:45:43):**  with their thinking, their work, their entertainment, what this does is it inverts this exterior  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:45:59):**  view, to an interior view.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:03):**  And that self-examination, that interiorization of thought, you know, it does make us start  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:16):**  to rethink some of the things that we're doing.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:20):**  I don't think that the restaurant trade is ever going to come back like it was.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:27):**  I just don't think it ever will.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:29):**  And so, for example, Tricia and I, we're baby boomers, you know, I'll be 64 next year,  
**[0:46:35-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:35):**  and we're baby boomers.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:37):**  So that means our parents were World War II generation, and our grandparents were depression  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:44):**  or pre-depression.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:46):**  And so we're sitting here thinking, all right, if this is our depression, if this is, you  
**[0:46:51-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:51):**  know, we're talking about 20 and 30% unemployment, which is as much as it was in the 1929 Great  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:46:58):**  Depression.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:01):**  And we're saying, well, you know, how did we grow up?  
**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:04):**  We were post depression, we were, how did we grow up?  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:08):**  And we realized, we never went out to eat, you know.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:12):**  And I'll be very sexist here.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:15):**  Women traded recipes all the time.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:18):**  They didn't trade Netflix, you know, the latest Netflix craze.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:27):**  They didn't trade the latest gossip from the Kardashians.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:30):**  They traded recipes.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:33):**  And so, and in fact, our favorite recipes are from, you know, she grew up in a Presbyterian  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:40):**  church and every five years they made a recipe book.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:43):**  It's still, you know, still some of our many of our favorite recipes.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:48):**  And so when you start looking at that social structure, you realize they didn't need  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:53):**  the Kardashians, they didn't need Netflix, they were trading recipes, for crying out  
**[0:47:58-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:58):**  loud.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:47:59):**  You know, wouldn't it be cool if this kind of shock brought, maybe not all of it, but  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:07):**  at least a renewed appreciation of where that's not viewed as just, you know, old stodgy,  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:13):**  you know, stodgy Neanderthal living, but actually is, hey, that's pretty cool, grandma, you  
**[0:48:19-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:19):**  know, that's pretty cool.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:20):**  Yeah, this could end up being a real bridge between the generations as well.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:25):**  It sure could.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:27):**  And just, and then savings.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:29):**  I mean, I was reading the Wall Street Journal a month ago and they did a huge special section  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:37):**  on millennials.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:39):**  You know, this year, someday this year, the buying power of millennials is going to pass  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:46):**  the buying power of baby boomers.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:48):**  So we're having this huge generational transfer in market power.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:48:55):**  And so I read this section and I, you know, read through it.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:02):**  And what was interesting was that the people that they interviewed, one of the common things  
**[0:49:10-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:10):**  was, there are a lot of positive things in millennials, but the one glaring negative  
**[0:49:17-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:17):**  was that as a group, they would rather spend money on enjoyment today than save money for,  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:26):**  you know, something they'll enjoy for a rainy day fund or something they'll enjoy later,  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:32):**  deferred enjoyment.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:35):**  My goodness, we grew up, I mean, saving was in our DNA.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:38):**  We saved squares of aluminum foil.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:42):**  There was a drawer in the kitchen where, you know, if something was wrapped in aluminum  
**[0:49:48-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:48):**  foil, you took it off carefully and then you put it in this drawer.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:51):**  That was the aluminum foil scrap drawer.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:49:54):**  And Teresa's grandmother had a string, she had a string strung in the ceiling of the  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:00):**  kitchen, and she would wash and hang up pieces of Saran wrap.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:04):**  When she'd unwrap something with Saran wrap, she'd hang it back up there and clothespin  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:08):**  it so it dried and she could reuse that scrap of Saran wrap again.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:13):**  The whole notion of just savings and stockpiling and, you know, preparing, you know, it obviously  
**[0:50:24-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:24):**  got a big kick at Y2K.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:26):**  Y2K was a big kick.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:28):**  And there are still people, I mean, Y2K kicked off the entire prepper, you know, prepper  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:34):**  movement.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:35):**  And, you know, it's not as big as it was in 2001 or 1999 for sure, but there are still  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:45):**  plenty of prepper, you know, leftovers.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:50):**  Oh, certainly.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:52):**  From that thing.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:53):**  And that turned out to be a complete non-event.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:50:57):**  So if we look at Y2K and see what it spawned in the whole prepper movement, imagine that  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:07):**  at, you know, at five times that power with what we're having today.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:13):**  So you know, this could have a pretty long tail.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:16):**  Yeah, there's definitely going to be endless talk from here on out from a pre and a post  
**[0:51:21-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:21):**  COVID-19 world.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:24):**  It's pretty wild to be living in that transfer because it's almost like this is the little  
**[0:51:28-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:28):**  eye of the hurricane, right?  
**[0:51:30-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:30):**  This is when things aren't necessarily happening so much.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:33):**  If you're confined to your home, if you've, you know, lost your job, your job either temporarily  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:39):**  or permanently now, this is still kind of the calm period while people are trying to  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:44):**  figure things out and try and predict what's going to happen after this.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:47):**  And it's such a weird and eerie little moment in history to be experiencing collectively.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:55):**  I think that's really the anomaly of all of this is that we're all going through it at  
**[0:51:58-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:58):**  the same time.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:51:59):**  I mean, I'm talking about the exact same event from Spain to Virginia right now.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:04):**  And that in itself is remarkable.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:06):**  That's unprecedented in history.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:08):**  Well, sure.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:09):**  I mean, imagine during the, what was it, the tulip, you know, the economic tulip collapse  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:17):**  in the Netherlands and whatever it was, 1500 or some such thing.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:21):**  That was such a huge thing or the Black Death or whatever.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:26):**  Our ability now to, you know, communicate and transfer information, collect data, and  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:34):**  collaborate, network, share experiences is unprecedented.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:40):**  So yes, this worldwide event is coupled with our technology to be able to communicate about  
**[0:52:52-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:52):**  it.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:52:54):**  Makes this very different than it would have been, say, 200 years ago when news of what  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:02):**  was happening in Wuhan would not have, you know, transferred somebody else.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:08):**  And of course, a person couldn't go and come from Wuhan in 48 hours back then either.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:17):**  You know, it was a long, slow process.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:22):**  So yes, you're right.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:24):**  It is a very, very unique time.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:30):**  But I agree with you.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:31):**  I think the fallout from this is very much still to be determined economically.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:38):**  I mean, I'm seeing, you know, governments don't have money.  
**[0:53:45-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:53:45):**  They either take money through taxes, licensing, and fees, or they simply print more.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:00):**  Now, you know, I don't mean run printing presses, but they can create money out of thin air.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:06):**  And that, of course, is normally, one is confiscatory, the other one is inflationary.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:15):**  But the, you know, the economic ramifications of what's going on here to try to print enough  
**[0:54:23-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:23):**  money to make up the shortfall for 30% of the economy is just…  
**[0:54:31-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:31):**  I'm right there with you.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:33):**  And we could go on a whole another interview just on these topics.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:36):**  But instead of going that direction, how about I give you one more question to kind of wrap  
**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:42):**  this one up.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:45):**  With how things are happening so fast and changing so quickly, and from having your  
**[0:54:50-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:50):**  finger on the pulse of regenerative agriculture, especially in the United States for decades  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:54:55):**  now, where do you see the future of regenerative ecological agriculture going?  
**[0:55:02-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:02):**  And maybe what would you recommend to others who are either in this or getting started  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:06):**  in it that they might, you know, want to adapt to or expect as things continue?  
**[0:55:12-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:12):**  Well, I think here again, we have kind of two opposing forces.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:19):**  We have, on the one hand, we have the industrial, you know, if you will, the Monsanto's and  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:26):**  Bayer's of the world.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:28):**  They haven't taken their foot off the gas at all.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:31):**  Many of us thought that this whole roundup thing was going to be a, you know, a kind  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:38):**  of a collapse, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:43):**  I mean, all the commercial farmers that I know, they think the whole thing is a joke,  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:50):**  and they're buying roundup and GMOs as fast as anything.  
**[0:55:54-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:55:54):**  So I see on the one hand, and you know, factory farms are still being built, I don't see  
**[0:56:04-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:04):**  that foot off the gas pedal at all.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:07):**  Now, many of us think that that is certainly not regenerative, it's not even sustainable,  
**[0:56:17-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:17):**  it can't continue.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:18):**  They will, and so on the other side, so we represent the complete 180 degree other side  
**[0:56:26-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:26):**  of that whole issue.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:32):**  So what we have to be is an antidote and preparing the antidote for when that system collapses.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:42):**  Now, you know, we had mad cow, we had the hoof and mouth in Great Britain, I mean, we've  
**[0:56:49-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:49):**  had avian flu, we've had swine flu.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:52):**  Of course, China has just gone through this huge swine, this African swine epidemic that  
**[0:56:58-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:56:58):**  dropped their swine production by 30 or 40%, which has been largely made up by American  
**[0:57:03-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:03):**  production because they bought Smithfield, the largest Chinese acquisition of an American  
**[0:57:09-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:09):**  company was the pigs.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:13):**  And so we see these cracks starting to happen, desertification, all these kinds of things  
**[0:57:21-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:21):**  happening.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:24):**  And so I think that one of our goals in the regenerative agriculture movement, yes, we  
**[0:57:31-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:31):**  don't like this stuff, and from time to time we do, you know, rail against it, okay?  
**[0:57:37-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:37):**  But I think where we need to channel our energy, we need to channel our energy in really developing  
**[0:57:45-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:45):**  credible, viable alternatives as antidotes for all the weaknesses and fragility that  
**[0:57:55-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:57:55):**  we see in the industrial system so that when it does finally reach its inability to perform,  
**[0:58:13-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:58:13):**  i.e., the chemicals don't work as well, there just isn't enough organic matter in the soil  
**[0:58:19-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:58:19):**  to even convert chemical, you know, NPK to plant food.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:58:27):**  When the aquifers are depleted, when the rains don't come as much, all the different things,  
**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:58:35):**  we need to be doing the things, we need to be growing the vegetation, building the soil,  
**[0:58:40-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:58:40):**  getting efficient protocols in place, building the immune system of our plants, the immune  
**[0:58:48-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:58:48):**  system of our animals, of our people, so that when that tipover occurs, we have a viable  
**[0:58:58-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:58:58):**  antidote that can quickly diffuse.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:02):**  We will be the innovation that then can quickly diffuse throughout the suffering system and  
**[0:59:09-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:09):**  create the balm that the suffering system needs when it's in collapse.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:14):**  Well said.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:15):**  I mean, you can see indications of that happening already, and it's so great that this has been  
**[0:59:23-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:23):**  an economic advantage for those producers, because they're the people who could really  
**[0:59:28-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:28):**  use it the most.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:29):**  That's where your money stays in the community, and it goes right back into improving the  
**[0:59:34-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:34):**  earth around you.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:36):**  For something like that to be happening out of what seems to be a disaster for just about  
**[0:59:42-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:42):**  everybody else, it really gives me a lot of hope.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joel-salatin-has-hope-for-a-post-covid-regenerative-agri-culture/#t=0:59:46):**  On that note, Joel, can you tell our listeners how they can get in touch with you and your

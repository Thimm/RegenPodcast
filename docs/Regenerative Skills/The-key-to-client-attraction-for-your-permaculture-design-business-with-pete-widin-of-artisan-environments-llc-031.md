**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:13):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:14):**  Alright, so let's start from the beginning.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:16):**  Tell me a bit about your background and how you got started in conventional landscape  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:20):**  design and then permaculture.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:22):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:24):**  So my background started when I went to college.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:29):**  I was originally going to go to music school but my parents said you need to do something  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:32):**  that makes money.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:33):**  You need to have a real job.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:35):**  So I decided to go into ecology and I studied applied ecology at Michigan Tech and I got  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:40):**  a Bachelors of Science there which is basically wildlife habitat management, forestry, and  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:46):**  then restoration, so ecological restoration.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:50):**  And I did a lot of research projects and research work while I was in that program and I realized  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:03:56):**  that I was being trained to be a researcher and I really wanted to affect some greater  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:00):**  type of change on our landscapes and whatever scale that might be.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:05):**  And so I decided to attend grad school.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:09):**  I almost went to a place called the Conway School which is well known to a lot of permaculture  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:13):**  designers and that's out in Massachusetts.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:16):**  But I ended up deciding on the University of Michigan and I got a three year masters  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:20):**  degree in landscape architecture.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:23):**  And that was really focused on native landscapes, green infrastructure for cities, storm water  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:29):**  management.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:30):**  But my passion has always been edible plants, medicinal plants, whatnot, fiber, all the  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:37):**  uses of plants and how we interact with them.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:40):**  And my mom's a plant pathologist so she's known as a tree doctor.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:44):**  She'll go around to people's homes and tell them what's wrong with their trees and I went  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:48):**  around with her a lot growing up and I was in Boy Scouts as well.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:51):**  I just spent a lot of time outdoors.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:04:53):**  Anything from building forts to zero hero winter camping and tying knots but also just  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:05:01):**  burning ants and stupid boy stuff.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:05:03):**  I did it outside.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:05:04):**  So I wanted a job where I was going to be outside and it had taken a long time for me

**[0:15:14-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:15:14):**  and magazines that have information on the different events going on in town or different  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:15:22):**  places that could host an event that I could be at as well.

**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:15:31):**  or plants.

**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:15:38):**  because they're into their health, they're into connecting with nature, things like that.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:15:42):**  So I went to a local kirtan chanting group which is a music celebration at a yoga studio  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:15:48):**  and I left that night with three potential clients, two of whom turned into really strong  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:15:53):**  leads for me and one of those clients actually is going to be doing a $2,400 design with  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:15:59):**  me in about a month here once things slow down with this construction work.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:04):**  So that's an example from an in-person design business in a local area, something you could  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:08):**  do for ways for people to find you.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:10):**  Actually I'm going to keep on that topic and mention that I've been going to a weekly meet-up  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:18):**  of Master Gardeners at the local library.

**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:22):**  Like these community centers, people come, there's a lot of circulation.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:26):**  That's always been a good resource.

**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:34):**  about their own, I don't know, read romantic fiction.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:37):**  It's learning in some way I'm sure.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:16:40):**  And this Master Gardener group asked me yesterday when I was talking with them, hey, you need

**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:18:36):**  I refer to transactional and that, oh, well going to this group tonight would actually  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:18:41):**  mean that I might be able to get some clients or something like that versus just saying,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:18:45):**  oh, I'd really love to go to this and meet the people who are there.

**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:18:56):**  type of thing of, oh, am I spending my time doing something that could earn me money?  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:19:01):**  You know, when you're just starting a business and you're really wanting that cashflow.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:19:04):**  And that's actually where I'm at down here in Florida where I'm just starting moved here  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:19:08):**  a month ago.

**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:19:13):**  testing out these techniques that I'm honing and learning how to create a business that

**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:19:28):**  But also really being able to build the relationships.

**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:19:40):**  types of words here but really what we're doing is we're making friends and we're building

**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:19:57):**  and sometimes struggles with getting out just on my own but listen to do social stuff.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:20:02):**  You're right, you do definitely need to find a balance between, you know, looking at these

**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:20:14):**  like yeah well maybe I'll get some leads or clients or you know something like that too.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:20:18):**  So definitely a balance needs to be struck but in my case it's often the motivator to  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:20:23):**  go out and be more social in general.

**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:20:46):**  energy again is when I'm alone doing something like, you know, playing guitar or I'll go  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:20:50):**  for a swim in the ocean alone, something like that.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:20:53):**  And one thing that's really helped me a lot is actually going to places that are a public  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:21:00):**  place to say do some work or read a book or even like a park to go hang out in.

**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:21:12):**  and I've found that over time in my life that's kind of broken down some of the feeling of  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:21:17):**  shyness in terms of at least getting out of the house and just realizing okay yeah the

**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:21:43):**  or who they are and what not.

**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-key-to-client-attraction-for-your-permaculture-design-business-with-pete-widin-of-artisan-environments-llc/#t=0:22:04):**  you have to offer.

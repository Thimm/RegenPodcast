**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:05:37):**  in the Midwest and people with larger acreage who are looking to implement this on traditional

**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:05:44):**  So what do you say we just get down to the questions?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:05:46):**  Sure.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:05:47):**  All right.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:05:48):**  So look, before we get started, can you tell us a little bit about your personal background  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:05:53):**  and what got you interested in managing your land in what was quite an alternative way  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:05:58):**  when you first started?  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:00):**  Okay.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:01):**  So I did not grow up on a farmer ranch.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:05):**  I grew up in town and I became interested in agriculture when I was in high school and  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:12):**  started working on farms.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:14):**  And I went off to the university and I actually was going to be a agriculture education instructor,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:21):**  in other words, a teacher.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:23):**  And as luck would have it, I married my high school sweetheart and she was from a farm  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:29):**  and she has two sisters, but her, uh, no brothers.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:34):**  So her parents asked us if we'd be interested in moving back to the, to the farm and perhaps  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:42):**  taking it over.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:44):**  And so once I graduated from college, that's what we did.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:48):**  We moved back to the farm and I actually learned how to farm from my father-in-law.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:53):**  He farmed very conventionally.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:06:54):**  In other words, it was a lot of tillage and, and, uh, synthetic fertilizers, uh, monoculture,  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:03):**  small grain production, not a lot of diversity.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:07):**  And that's how I learned to farm.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:09):**  Well, I started renting some land on my own and I farmed just like he did.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:15):**  Then we ended up purchasing a part of the farm from them in 1991.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:20):**  And, and I continued to farm that way.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:23):**  Then what happened was a series of natural disasters.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:27):**  Um, well, I should step back for a second.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:32):**  What happened in 1994, I had read a lot about no till and in our environment, moisture is  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:41):**  fairly limited.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:42):**  We get approximately 16 inches of total precipitation a year.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:48):**  And I knew that I could save and conserve some moisture by going no till.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:52):**  So I purchased a no till drill and went to a hundred percent no till.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:58):**  I just jumped in.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:07:59):**  I had to sell my tillage equipment in order to be able to afford that no till drill.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:04):**  So I was totally bought in and we started no tilling.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:09):**  Then what happened in 1995, we were no tilling.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:14):**  I started to diversify the crop rotation a little bit.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:17):**  We lost a hundred percent of our crop to hail.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:20):**  And so I had no crop income.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:23):**  1996 came along and we lost a hundred percent of our crop to hail again.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:30):**  1997 came along and we dried out.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:33):**  It was very limited moisture.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:35):**  Nobody combined anything in our area.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:38):**  So I was three years of no grain income.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:42):**  I did have a few beef cattle, so was making a little bit of money that way, but obviously  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:48):**  the banker wasn't going to loan me money anymore because I hadn't paid them back yet.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:53):**  I was thankful that he didn't foreclose on me.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:08:56):**  1998 came along and we lost 80% of our crop to hail.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:00):**  So those four years of natural disaster were really teaching me some lessons.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:07):**  And I tell people that laid the foundation.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:10):**  It forced me to learn how ecosystems function and how can I make this land productive without  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:22):**  all these added inputs, without buying the commercial fertilizers and pesticides and  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:28):**  fungicides and everything else.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:31):**  And I tell people in my book, it was really a journey.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:35):**  And it's a never ending learning experience.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:38):**  I'm learning new things every year.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:41):**  But the more I observed nature and learned how nature functions, the more I realized  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:48):**  that my task as a farmer, as a rancher, was to be a good steward of the land and figure  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:09:55):**  out how can I work best with nature instead of against her.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:00):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:01):**  I think that's a common motivation for a lot of people who are looking to make this change  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:05):**  in the way that they're managing their land.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:08):**  Now going back to your initial motivations for switching over to no till, you said because  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:15):**  you're in an area with such restricted precipitation that no till made sense to conserve more moisture  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:22):**  in the ground.

**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:27):**  How did you start to get the feedback that this was the way to go when you didn't have  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:32):**  a crop to show any results for that amount of time?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:37):**  What sort of made you persevere past this disaster?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:10:41):**  That's a very good question.

**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:11:27):**  Well that's the second principle, armoring the soil.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:11:32):**  Then what was also happening, realized I had a herd of beef cattle, I needed to feed them.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:11:38):**  Well I started to grow forage crops specifically for feed for the livestock, crops such as  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:11:48):**  sorghum, sedan grass and cowpeas and alfalfa and millets.

**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:12:00):**  That is the third principle.

**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:12:10):**  livestock.

**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:12:17):**  Well what I was doing was adding a living root into the soil as long as possible throughout  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:12:23):**  the year.

**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:12:29):**  So those are the fourth and fifth principles.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:12:32):**  So I was really learning the lesson of these principles of a healthy soil ecosystem.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:12:40):**  It seems like not having an income from the crop still gave you a lot of very quick feedback

**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:12:56):**  That's exactly right.

**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:13:05):**  Well my father-in-law, I tell people that my father-in-law practiced recreational tillage.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:13:10):**  He'd go and till just for the fun of it.

**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:13:18):**  Well now because I had been no till, no disturbance because the soil was covered, because there  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:13:23):**  was living roots, all of a sudden the soil was coming back to life.

**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:13:35):**  It was above ground also.

**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:13:42):**  All of a sudden I was starting to see deer and pheasants and grouse and all these bird

**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale-with-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown-author-of-from-dirt-to-soil/#t=0:13:50):**  The reason was there was habitat for them.

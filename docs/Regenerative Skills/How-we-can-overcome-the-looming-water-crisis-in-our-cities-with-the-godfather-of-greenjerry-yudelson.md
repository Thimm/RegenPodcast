### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 05:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:40):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:19):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:20):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:25):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:39):**  All right, everybody, welcome back to the second episode in this series on waterway  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:45):**  regeneration.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:46):**  Now in this series, we'll be looking into the often overlooked role of the water cycle  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:51):**  and its effect on the climate crisis.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:53):**  Now, I'll be speaking with experts and innovators about how repairing the hydrological cycle  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:01:58):**  and the health of our waterways can lead to the restoration of all sorts of ecological  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:02):**  services and the health of entire ecosystems as a result.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:06):**  In this week's episode, I got to chat with Jerry Utilson, the author of 13 full-length  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:12):**  professional and trade books on green buildings, integrated design, green homes, water conservation,  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:18):**  building performance, and sustainable development.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:21):**  Dubbed the Godfather of Green by Wired Magazine, Jerry's passion for optimizing the built environment  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:27):**  is reflected in his many years of professional experience in the green building and certification  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:31):**  fields, serving as an elected LEED fellow and as president of the Green Building Initiative.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:36):**  He also served on the National Board of the U.S. Green Building Council and chaired the  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:41):**  Steering Committee for the largest green building show, Green Build, from 2004 through 2009.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:47):**  Now, despite being best known for ecological building design and policy, in this interview  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:53):**  we're going to focus on his book, Dry Run, which unpacks some of the best ways to manage  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:02:58):**  scarce water resources and handle upcoming urban water crises.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:04):**  The book explains the most pressing water issues that urban zones face, and examines  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:08):**  the vital linkages between water energy use, urban development, and climate change.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:14):**  Dry Run also demonstrates the best practices for achieving net-zero water use in the building  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:19):**  environment through things like water conservation strategies for buildings, factories, cities,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:25):**  and homes, rainwater harvesting, greywater use and water reclamation systems, water efficiency  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:31):**  retrofits, on-site sewage treatment, and new water reuse and supply technologies.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:38):**  In this interview, we specifically address the urgent changes that cities need to make  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:42):**  to ensure longer-term water security.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:45):**  Jerry also explains his classifications of the colors of water that help to categorize  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:50):**  the different sources and uses of water in cities that require different management systems,  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:55):**  and gives a few cases of the municipalities that have started to make improvements on  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:03:59):**  their aquatic infrastructure.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:00):**  Now, if you're interested in learning more about regenerative solutions for the urban  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:05):**  water crisis, this is your chance to win your own copy of Dry Run.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:10):**  I've teamed up with New Society Publishers to send a free copy anywhere in the US or  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:14):**  Canada, or a digital copy anywhere in the world.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:17):**  All you have to do to be eligible to win is to write me a post on our Regenerative Skills  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:21):**  Facebook group about how you plan to become active in regenerating your local water infrastructure.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:27):**  This can be about anything, I'm just curious about what your motivations are and what inspires  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:33):**  you to get involved in this.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:34):**  You can find a link to the group on the show notes for this episode, or you can search  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:39):**  for the group name on Facebook directly.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:41):**  And I'll really look forward to sending a copy out to you soon.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:45):**  Now I'll hand things over to Jerry.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:47):**  Hey Jerry, thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me today.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:50):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:51):**  Good, Oliver, I'm really happy to talk about water as one of my first real love in academia.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:04:57):**  And here it is quite a few years later and still a hot topic.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:02):**  Indeed, and hotter by the moment.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:04):**  I mean, we're really living through some pending crisis where it's gotten started in a lot  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:10):**  of places and others it's kind of on a tipping point.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:12):**  So why don't we start out by having you explain a little bit of the urgency of the water crisis  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:18):**  that we're collectively facing around the world from both an urban and a rural perspective.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:23):**  Yeah, so you know the water crisis is not de-linked from the climate crisis.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:32):**  It's part and parcel of it.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:35):**  As things get warmer, water gets both scarcer and it starts to behave differently.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:43):**  So when you think about the water, you think about growing population, maybe adding another  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:48):**  20 to 30% of the earth's population before we top out according to demographers.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:05:56):**  Water becomes a critical in the US, in the Western US, which is quite dry.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:05):**  They had a slogan a hundred years ago that was, whiskey is for drinking and water is  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:10):**  for fighting.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:14):**  So that is going to be a source of contention in between countries, between regions going  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:20):**  forward for the rest of the century.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:22):**  Indeed.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:23):**  Now, what are some of the biggest consumption points of water?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:27):**  I know agriculture is the number one, but as far as what we have access to and what  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:32):**  we can affect in an urban setting, where is most of the water being consumed?  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:36):**  Well, it's kind of divided up, you know, residential, commercial, industrial uses.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:42):**  A lot of it is very regionally specific.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:46):**  When I lived in Tucson, Arizona in the dry Southwest desert, water was treated quite  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:06:54):**  a bit differently than when I lived in Portland, Oregon on the banks of the Columbia River,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:00):**  the largest river in Western North America.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:03):**  So it depends on where you are.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:07):**  And I think that's one of the differences, let's say between energy, renewable energy  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:13):**  as a solution to coal fired and gas fired power plants.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:18):**  It really doesn't matter where you live in terms of energy, but water issues are very  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:24):**  specific to regions and even cities.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:28):**  And as we start to live more and more in cities, I fear that we're going to become more divorced  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:34):**  from our understanding of water.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:36):**  And that's a critical political issue going forward.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:39):**  Now I've seen this play out in a number of different places.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:42):**  I've been to both of the cities that you mentioned, Tucson and Portland, where I lived for a while  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:46):**  as well.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:47):**  And I've also heard of a number of crises from around the world, such as in Cape Town  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:51):**  a couple of years ago, where they nearly ran out completely for that entire population  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:57):**  there.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:07:58):**  And as you mentioned, it's being manifested in different ways in different regions, depending  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:02):**  on how brittle their ecology is and how they're managing their water resources.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:07):**  Give me an idea of how it's playing out in some of these places.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:11):**  Yeah, but there are certain things that are in common.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:14):**  For example, one of the things that's happening with global climate change is that the amount  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:22):**  of snowpack that we're getting in all of the places that depend on snow melt for summer  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:29):**  water flows and rivers, that's going down.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:33):**  All of the glaciers in the world are melting.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:37):**  And as a result, we're going to have increasingly stressed summer water availability throughout  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:45):**  the world or everywhere that's dependent on snow melt.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:49):**  We're also seeing faster runoff because the storms are getting bigger.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:08:54):**  So you may see dams overtopping or failing, which happened in Northern California just  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:01):**  about within a few percent of failing a winter or two ago.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:08):**  So there's all kinds of things going on.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:13):**  And then in terms of agriculture, soil moisture is going to be going down because of hotter  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:19):**  temperatures.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:20):**  So all of a sudden, the things that you use to depend on with dry land agriculture, it's  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:24):**  going to be more and more difficult just to grow enough food for people in a large number  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:31):**  of regions of the world.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:33):**  So that is more problematic because if you don't have food and you can still walk, you're  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:38):**  going to migrate.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:40):**  And that is a crisis that's tied in with water availability.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:45):**  And you can see that happening right now in the Middle East.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:48):**  Certainly.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:49):**  And it really echoes something that I've been learning from all kinds of agricultural practitioners  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:55):**  around the world.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:09:56):**  It's not so much that overall waterfall or I guess rainfall is going down in their region.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:04):**  It's more that it's becoming increasingly erratic.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:07):**  With the increase in temperatures, it's evaporating much faster.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:12):**  And like you said, it's coming all at once in certain periods with heavy rainfalls, less  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:18):**  consistent snowfalls in the winter.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:21):**  And though they might be getting the same amount of water, it's very hard to deal with  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:25):**  it when it comes all at once.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:26):**  And then there's long dry spells to try and weather through in between.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:30):**  Do you start to get into solutions for this through some of your strategies or should  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:36):**  we focus more on the urban landscape today?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:39):**  Well, you know, I think what it tells you is that you need to rethink your whole ideas  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:47):**  around water storage and water availability.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:52):**  But as we learned in the energy field starting in the 1970s, the first thing you can do is  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:10:59):**  to cut consumption or wasted consumption.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:03):**  And in my book, Dry Run, which you were very nice to cite as a source, it's actually 10  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:10):**  years old now, but still quite accurate.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:18):**  What we find is that water conservation is actually the cheapest form of energy conservation  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:23):**  because we use so much electricity to move and treat water and wastewater.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:31):**  In California, 20% of our electricity use goes to just water movement and treatment.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:41):**  So all of a sudden, if we say, well, let's cut water consumption, we're also cutting  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:46):**  our energy demand quite dramatically and quite cost effectively.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:52):**  So the first thing I would say is if you look at water consumption around the world, what  
**[0:11:58-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:11:58):**  you find is that a tremendous amount of water is wasted in old piping systems in cities.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:07):**  And a lot of these things in the developing countries go back to colonial days.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:13):**  Remember, colonial days only ended 60 years ago, roughly.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:18):**  And so the piping systems that might have been put in by the British or the French or  
**[0:12:22-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:22):**  the other colonial masters may not have been upgraded or improved throughout by the new  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:31):**  nations.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:32):**  So we're finding in countries, let's say Indonesia or Thailand or countries like that, something  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:39):**  like 30 to 40% of the water that leaves the water treatment plant never gets to a customer.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:46):**  It's just wasted into the ground or through leaks otherwise.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:50):**  If you go to Germany, the more developed countries with a lot of systems in place for infrastructure  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:12:57):**  or maintenance, it's like 7%.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:02):**  And I remember during the Australian water crisis of roughly 10 years ago, when Cindy  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:08):**  was, as you mentioned, Cape Town, Sydney was close to running out of water, that a report  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:15):**  I read found that 16% of the water delivered to office buildings was wasted to leaks.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:22):**  And that was not in the pipes and in the ground, but just in the leaks in the system in the  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:28):**  old buildings.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:29):**  So the first thing I would do, you say, well, if you want to stop a dam failure, first you've  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:36):**  got to plug the leaks in the dam, right?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:40):**  The first thing is conservation is don't waste it.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:44):**  And the second is efficient fixtures, which we basically have moved to in the US and many  
**[0:13:50-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:50):**  other countries where you're down to the three liters per flush for toilets and so forth.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:13:58):**  Efficient use of water.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:00):**  And then you say, well, how am I going to get efficient use?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:03):**  And then in my book, I make quite a strong case for pricing as a mechanism.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:10):**  So we could talk some more about that.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:13):**  There is a case to be made for basically giving water, certain small amounts of water for  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:19):**  free to every household as a basic human right.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:24):**  But once you get above basic levels for bathing and cooking, a lot of stuff gets wasted as  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:30):**  we know and you have to start pricing it accordingly.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:35):**  And pricing it does change behavior.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:37):**  Yeah, that's a very logical strategy.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:40):**  And it's interesting to me how that hasn't happened yet, especially for how much it's  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:44):**  costing municipalities, like you said, in energy and other infrastructure costs.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:48):**  But before we get into that, can you explain the colors of water as you describe in your  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:14:53):**  book Dry Run from blue, gray, brown, black, green and even Zen and new, which I was not  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:00):**  familiar with until I read it?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:02):**  Well, you know, I decided as a writer, by this time, I had already written several books  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:11):**  on green buildings and related topics.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:13):**  And I wanted to do something that people would remember.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:19):**  And so I said, well, I got this idea for the colors of water.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:24):**  And so you start out with blue water, which is the fresh water that we all like and that  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:32):**  we get out of our tap and out of our rivers.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:37):**  And then we go to sort of from blue water to gray water.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:41):**  And when I lived in Tucson, I actually put in a gray water system and recycled my washing  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:49):**  machines.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:50):**  And that was part of the plumbing I could get to my washing machine water, recycled  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:15:55):**  that for through a filter to water some very high water consumption trees that happened  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:02):**  to be in my yard.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:04):**  And I was able to do it with just a gravity flow system.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:09):**  And then you sort of go to that's gray water, which means it's been through some process.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:15):**  And then I thought about brown water, which recycled rainwater.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:21):**  And of course, this is the classic way in weather climates where people would get their  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:27):**  water supply, they would put in a cistern or some other way to catch water when it rained  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:33):**  coming off the roof and then filter it or at least throw in some bleach, chlorine for  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:40):**  disinfectant.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:41):**  And in Australia, New South Wales, there's quite a big program of reusing rainwater and  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:50):**  designing roofs and so forth so that you can capture a lot of it.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:55):**  It's not hard.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:16:57):**  The question is always, how do you keep the mosquito?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:00):**  How do you do that with screening and how do you keep it clean?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:03):**  And you do that with disinfectant.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:06):**  And then you still got to use energy to pump it back into your house, but there may be  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:11):**  uses for rainwater, including irrigation.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:14):**  So that was kind of brown water.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:16):**  And then of course, black water is sewage.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:21):**  And sewage is 98% water.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:23):**  So lots of people say, well, why should we just take pure water, put it in our toilets,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:31):**  flush once and it's gone and now it's contaminated and we have to basically treat it and then  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:38):**  throw it away.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:39):**  And so a lot of people are now saying, well, we do better.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:44):**  And so in one of my books, I profiled a very large office building, I think 30 stories  
**[0:17:49-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:49):**  in Sydney, 1 Bligh Street it's called, where they have a black water treatment in the basement  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:17:58):**  actually, literally in the bowels of the building.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:01):**  And they use it to do cooling water makeup because in a big office building, you're basically  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:07):**  running cooling year round because of all the internal heat sources.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:12):**  And so just again, cooling makeup water is just there to be evaporated through a cooling  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:19):**  system.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:20):**  So why not treat black water, which they did in the basement, make it clean enough to use  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:27):**  so it doesn't clog the filters.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:29):**  And so that was kind of black water and it does work.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:33):**  And then, you know, green water of course is green water for irrigation and a lot of  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:40):**  cities now, interestingly enough, are rethinking their whole stormwater infrastructure.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:47):**  So the original idea with civil engineers, and I was originally trained as a civil engineer,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:53):**  is get it out of here as fast as possible.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:18:58):**  And so you design all of these systems for floodwater management that would take the  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:04):**  floodwaters and dump them in an air by river as quickly as possible.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:08):**  Well, people are thinking, NASA, that's kind of dumb because if we're going to be in a  
**[0:19:13-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:13):**  water shortage time and we do use a lot of water from groundwater, why don't we intercept  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:22):**  the floodwaters through green infrastructure like parks and roadway medians and so forth,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:30):**  and then slow it down enough so it will then infiltrate and become groundwater or at least  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:39):**  slow it down so it will infiltrate and come out more slowly because in cities, the big  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:44):**  problem is all the paved surfaces mean much faster runoff and therefore bigger floods  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:49):**  downstream, et cetera.  
**[0:19:51-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:19:51):**  And then I kind of got in the idea of Zen water, which was basically the idea was can  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:00):**  we design buildings and facilities that totally subsist on rainwater.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:08):**  In other words, they treat their wastewater, they use it for some purpose, and the answer  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:13):**  is you can do that.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:14):**  I personally don't think it's a great idea because I'm still enough of a civil engineer  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:21):**  to say, well, what about who's responsible for the health?  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:27):**  If I'm going to recycle water in a building for drinking purposes, who is going to be  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:34):**  responsible for the health outcomes?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:37):**  What I would maintain is that hardly any building owner wants to be responsible.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:42):**  They'd rather point to the municipality if there's a problem with the water supply.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:47):**  And then I got the idea, well, what about new water, as you mentioned?  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:51):**  And new water, of course, can come from a variety of sources, but fundamentally we're  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:20:58):**  talking about desalination.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:00):**  And if you go to the Middle East, the Persian Gulf countries almost totally subsist on desalination  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:08):**  because they don't have any real rainfall to work with, maybe two or three inches a  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:13):**  year or under 100 millimeters of rainfall, and you can't live on that, and most of it  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:20):**  evaporates quickly.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:22):**  So you have to get water from the sea, and that means putting in energy, and then you  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:27):**  start to think about, well, can I combine solar power and desalination to deal with  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:33):**  the energy demands for desalting seawater?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:37):**  Because if you're doing that, you're going against nature.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:40):**  Nature wants to make everything the same concentration, and what you're trying to do with desalination  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:45):**  is you're trying to get pure water on one side and saltier water on the other, and that  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:51):**  takes a lot of energy.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:52):**  So long story short, I came up with the idea of these different colors of water as a way  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:21:57):**  to think about it, because otherwise you just say water, and it all sounds like it's all  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:02):**  the same thing.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:03):**  The point I was trying to make in the book was it's not really.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:06):**  Yeah, and it's an effective way at separating the different uses and the different sources  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:12):**  of these forms of water, as well as how they could be used better in our infrastructure.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:18):**  Could you, from here now, outline some of the solutions that you found, especially for  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:22):**  the urban water crisis?  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:24):**  I know we've gone over some of the ways that we can reroute different forms of water into  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:28):**  different uses, but when it comes to urban living, how can we apply the four R's that  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:35):**  you mentioned in your videos and in your book as well?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:38):**  Well, there's plenty of books on water, and plenty of good books on water, and what I  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:45):**  tried to do with this book was to say, well, we're going to keep building new stuff, and  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:52):**  if we keep building new stuff and growing population, which we are doing, we're going  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:22:58):**  to stress our water system.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:00):**  So I specifically wanted to address new construction and renovations, et cetera, because most buildings  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:08):**  and facilities and industries, they're going to be renovated many times over the next 100  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:15):**  years.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:16):**  And so there are opportunities, both with new buildings in places like China and India,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:21):**  which are building like crazy, and Africa, which is proposed to go from about a billion  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:29):**  people to three billion people by the end of the century.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:34):**  A lot of this infrastructure or water demanding infrastructure has yet to be built, so I wanted  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:41):**  to address particularly new buildings, but in doing that, I also felt like, well, you  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:46):**  can't just throw good ideas into a bad system, so how can we change the system?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:52):**  And one of the things that I found out, and actually found out quite a few years ago,  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:23:57):**  was that the price of water matters.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:01):**  And it used to be that the more you used, the less we charge you per unit of water,  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:08):**  and that was specifically designed for large users.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:11):**  The idea being I don't have to increase my infrastructure cost very much to double or  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:15):**  triple the amount of water I'm delivering.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:18):**  But what we discovered is that's a really bad idea if you start to be in a water short  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:23):**  environment, and what you should be doing instead is charging more per unit use.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:29):**  And so I mentioned earlier there has to be kind of a lifeline amount of water that everybody  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:35):**  gets for a very low price, but beyond that, you need to go up very steeply, and in fact,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:40):**  in water short places like Las Vegas, they charge eight times as much per unit at the  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:46):**  top end of their scale, and they have eight or nine different levels of water use for  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:53):**  a home or a business.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:24:55):**  They charge eight times as much per unit, so the incentive is really to conserve.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:01):**  And then they turn around, and the second part beyond just pricing is incentives, and  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:07):**  they turn around and they say, well, this is the desert, we only get three inches of  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:12):**  rain here in Las Vegas, 75 millimeters, and we'll pay you to take out your water using  
**[0:25:20-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:20):**  lawn, because, you know, it's funny, but we in America imported the English ideal of a  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:29):**  green lawn by every home.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:32):**  And in England, it's easy.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:33):**  In Portland, Oregon, it was easy to have a green lawn because it rains all the time.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:37):**  But in the drier parts of the U.S., which is really the western half of the U.S., it  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:44):**  doesn't.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:45):**  It certainly doesn't rain in the summer hardly at all.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:48):**  And so a green lawn is really a bad idea, particularly in desert cities like Phoenix  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:53):**  and Southwest and Las Vegas.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:25:56):**  So the second thing is incentives to put in infrastructure, whether it's paying for low-flush  
**[0:26:04-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:04):**  toilets, because we have a lot of older buildings that still have, I'm going to botch the conversion,  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:12):**  but let's just say that have 12 to 15 liters per flush of water.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:19):**  And if you think about it, that's just totally unnecessary.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:22):**  But if we want you to use less water, we've got to help you do that.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:27):**  And every water utility in the U.S. that has ever had a free toilet program, where they'll  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:37):**  essentially give you a toilet, you have to pay the plumber, has sold out in days, if  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:43):**  not weeks.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:45):**  And so incentives are a second part.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:49):**  A third part is just regulation.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:51):**  You just say, well, certain things you just can't do anymore.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:26:55):**  And so in Tucson, where I mentioned I lived for 10 years, you can't have an apartment  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:02):**  building that has a lawn.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:04):**  Now that's not a lot of fun for kids, but there are workarounds, obviously, but you  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:09):**  can't build an apartment building with a green lawn.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:12):**  And culturally, nobody puts a green lawn in their front yard anyway, anymore, and most  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:20):**  of the homeowners associations forbid it.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:23):**  So you have pricing, you have incentives, you have regulation.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:29):**  And finally, you have technology changes.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:32):**  You start to push people to think about how they're going to use water differently.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:38):**  If you have a warehouse, and the world is dotted with warehouses, because that's where  
**[0:27:44-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:44):**  all the container ships go, directly and indirectly, why shouldn't you be capturing rain off your  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:53):**  roof and using that for your water needs?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:27:57):**  If you have a factory, if I charge you right, meaning a lot more than you're paying today,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:05):**  you're going to figure out ways on your own to adopt new technology.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:09):**  And then when it comes to municipalities, we have a so-called AMI, which I think is  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:16):**  advanced metering infrastructure.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:20):**  We have ways now with drones and with drive-by readers and with our computer systems that  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:29):**  we have with our software.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:31):**  We can monitor leaks everywhere, and we can find them faster than they can be reported.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:37):**  And we can fix them, whether it's in a building, when you have a leak, it's very easy.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:43):**  If you're monitoring the water meter to see all of a sudden it's going crazy, and you  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:48):**  need to get an SMS message, a text message out to somebody who's on call to fix those  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:55):**  things.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:28:57):**  So you start to look at those four things, technology, incentives, regulation, and pricing,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:05):**  as the core structure for a water conservation program.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:11):**  And when people have done these things, it has worked.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:15):**  So everything I talk about in the book, even though it's 10 years old now, is something  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:19):**  that has been tried and proven in a variety of different places.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:24):**  And so we know this can work.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:26):**  It's just a matter of redoing our thinking.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:31):**  And simple things like in Tucson, they would cut the curbs.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:37):**  So you know, water is running down the side of the street where you have sidewalks.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:42):**  All you do is you cut the curb on the lower side of the street and allow the water to  
**[0:29:47-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:47):**  run into a median or into natural infrastructure, natural systems.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:29:58):**  Or you build those systems so that they work that way.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:02):**  And all of a sudden, a lot of water that winds up effectively in a place like Tucson in the  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:07):**  desert getting wasted to evaporation now gets recycled into the groundwater.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:13):**  So there's plenty to do.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:16):**  It's just that we've treated these systems as out of sight, out of mind, out of political  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:23):**  favor.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:24):**  There are not too many political favors you can do when you fix your water system, but  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:31):**  the impacts are enormous.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:33):**  Yeah, I'm well aware of the work that Brad Lancaster and his team have done down in Tucson.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:40):**  It's been a major inspiration for me and for many other people, especially who've worked  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:43):**  in dry land context.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:46):**  And I really like also the example that you gave of the different pay structures that  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:52):**  there are in Las Vegas.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:54):**  Now, have you found other examples of cities and municipalities that are managing their  
**[0:30:58-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:30:58):**  water sources in a regenerative way, or is it still kind of a matter of, I guess, reducing  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:08):**  the consumption and trying to reduce the waste that is inherent in the systems?  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:15):**  Have any of them actually gone to the point that you would consider it to be regenerative?  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:19):**  Well, the short answer is probably no.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:24):**  The longer answer is this awareness over the last decade, because of the focus on climate  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:32):**  change and the climate crisis, has forced engineers to rethink their whole profession.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:39):**  And when I started in civil engineering, they were still building big dams, and obviously  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:45):**  in parts of the world, they're still building big dams.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:48):**  But we basically stopped doing that in the US by 1970, and we've got the dams that we're  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:31:57):**  going to have because we're realizing that the ecological impacts and other impacts are  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:03):**  just too severe.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:06):**  But if you look at a place like Ethiopia now, which is just finishing a big dam, the downstream  
**[0:32:13-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:13):**  countries, Sudan and Egypt, are all of a sudden really worried about losing their water flow.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:21):**  It doesn't mean that they've done a lot to reduce consumption, it's just that they've  
**[0:32:25-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:25):**  relied on the Nile flows since antiquity, and all of a sudden the upstream country is  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:33):**  now going to start cutting it off.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:35):**  So what I would say is engineers, at least in the US particularly, over the last decade  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:42):**  have suddenly figured out they need to be in a different business, the same way energy  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:48):**  engineers have figured out they need to be in a different business, where you combine  
**[0:32:53-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:32:53):**  conservation and all of these incentives and pricing and regulation, you combine it all  
**[0:33:00-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:00):**  into a holistic system, as new supply is not a key part of it.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:08):**  And of course, you get into interesting problems.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:11):**  I'll just give you an example.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:14):**  The sewage treatment system in the US and in most countries relies on gravity flow.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:22):**  In other words, you start way upstream and you let the stuff flow downstream, and you  
**[0:33:29-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:29):**  design your piping system such that it flows fast enough to keep all the solids moving,  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:36):**  right?  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:38):**  And that system, now I come in with water conservation and I start reducing the water  
**[0:33:44-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:44):**  use upstream, and upstream means the more remote, suburban communities and the more  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:54):**  remote parts of cities, I start reducing the water use, all of a sudden there's not enough  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:33:59):**  flow to move the stuff.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:03):**  And so what do they do in Tucson and other places where they've done a lot of conservation?  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:09):**  They have to come in in August, open up the fire hydrants, stick the hose down in the  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:14):**  sewer and flush them, thereby consuming all of the water they have saved for the rest  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:21):**  of the year.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:22):**  So when they say you have to look at this holistically, you really do, you have to treat  
**[0:34:28-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:28):**  it as a system, and that's new for engineers because engineers love to build things, and  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:36):**  engineering consultants love to build things because that's where you make your money as  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:42):**  an engineering consultant, that's where construction firms make their money.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:47):**  But I guess the point I want to make and certainly for this call is before you build, analyze  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:34:55):**  your whole system, look at the opportunities for intervention, look at the opportunities  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:01):**  for soft water solutions, if you will.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:05):**  In the energy field we have a thing called soft energy paths, which is basically conservation,  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:12):**  but look for opportunities to reduce demand before you start trying to construct more  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:17):**  supply.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:18):**  And as I mentioned earlier, in a lot of developing countries, and I don't know what the right  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:24):**  terminology is these days, but you're losing such water to leaks.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:31):**  And by the way, it takes a decade or more to build a dam by the time you clear out all  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:36):**  the people living where the dam water's going to be.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:41):**  Inside of that decade, you could redo your whole piping system, employ a lot more people,  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:48):**  and save the same or more water than you're planning to get from the dam.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:35:54):**  It's just that politicians and engineers and construction companies like to build big dams.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:02):**  But right now, you do that in places like Southeast Asia.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:07):**  You build dams upstream on the Mekong River, and Vietnam is going to be in a world of hurt  
**[0:36:13-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:13):**  downstream.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:14):**  All of a sudden, that water's not going to flow.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:18):**  Their ecosystems that people rely on for fishing, livelihood, are all going to change.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:25):**  And so you're starting to invite big disasters.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:29):**  When Egypt built the Aswan Dam in the 1960s, when you build big dams in the tropics, you  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:37):**  also get diseases that are very difficult to deal with.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:41):**  And theirs was one called schistosomiasis, which is a snail, a freshwater snail that  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:49):**  causes a very difficult disease.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:36:53):**  And so all of the people who then lived alongside this new reservoir are getting sick.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:01):**  And so again, and in China, when they built the Three Gorges Dam, which I think is the  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:06):**  largest in the world now, they had to displace four million people.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:10):**  So you start to look at the social and economic impacts of large dams, and you realize this  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:17):**  is not a good solution until you've tried everything else.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:23):**  And I think that's the key message is when you look at it holistically, a dam usually  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:30):**  comes in as one of the last things you want to do, as opposed to one of the first things.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:36):**  And I know all of these circumstances are very context specific, but can you give me  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:42):**  any examples or perhaps even just throw out some ideas about what a regenerative water  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:46):**  system for a municipality or for an urban area might look like, or perhaps some elements  
**[0:37:52-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:52):**  that would fit into it?  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:54):**  Well, it's certainly starting to treat this system holistically.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:37:58):**  For example, in Los Angeles, the second largest city in the U.S., for historical reasons,  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:06):**  Los Angeles is basically in a desert.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:09):**  It gets an average of 16 inches or about between 350, 400 miles an hour of rain, and it mostly  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:22):**  comes within a five month period.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:25):**  So for seven months a year, it's pretty dry.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:27):**  So for historical reasons, Los Angeles had a water supply agency.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:35):**  They had a sewage treatment agency, and they had a flood control agency.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:40):**  And they all operated on their own.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:43):**  Flood control agency, as you might guess, their idea was to get the water from the mountains  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:49):**  to the ocean as fast as possible.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:52):**  The sewage treatment agency was to take whatever you gave them through the sewage pipes and  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:38:58):**  treat it a little and pump it out into the ocean.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:02):**  And the water treatment agency, their solution was to import water first from 200 miles away  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:10):**  from the Colorado River and then from 400 miles away from Northern California and to  
**[0:39:16-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:16):**  do it through all kinds of political means to supply the quote needs of Los Angeles.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:23):**  But if you think about it, the goal with flood control ought to be, and to some degree has  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:29):**  become, let's put it back in the groundwater.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:34):**  The goal of the water supply agency was where can I get water locally so I don't have to  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:43):**  import it, because importing it means also piping it over 4,000 foot mountains, 1300  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:50):**  meters roughly, net a lot of pumping up and pumping down.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:39:56):**  They also discovered that because they were overdrawing the groundwater that the ocean  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:01):**  was intruding on their groundwater supply all along.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:05):**  So then they cut a deal with the sewage agency and they said, well, why don't you take some  
**[0:40:10-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:10):**  of your treated sewage and instead of dumping it out to sea, pump it back into the ground  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:16):**  along the coast and form a barrier to the ocean water that's otherwise coming in as  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:22):**  we pump out groundwater in the interior.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:27):**  So all of a sudden we say, well, I'm going to put more in the groundwater for my floods.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:31):**  I'm going to take some of my sewage and use it for keeping the ocean at bay.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:38):**  Now you start to think about a holistic solution.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:41):**  Then they said, well, I have all this sewage sludge, the solids, the stuff that really  
**[0:40:45-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:45):**  stinks if you ever go to a sewage treatment plant, and I'm going to use that as agricultural  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:52):**  fertilizer.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:54):**  And so they start trucking that to the farms on the interior after doing the appropriate  
**[0:40:59-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:40:59):**  cleanup measures.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:01):**  And so you start to think holistically about the whole system, starting with the rain and  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:08):**  winding up with the sewage treatment and flood control.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:11):**  And you start to think, well, I need to have all of these things in the equation.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:16):**  I can't just optimize one.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:20):**  And in fact, Amory Lovins, who's a well-known energy guru, soft energy guru, says, what  
**[0:41:27-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:27):**  you do is you optimize each subsystem and you pessimize the entire system.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:36):**  And so I think that's a way to think about is everyone's trying to do their own thing  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:39):**  because we all have to put some blinders on to get our work done.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:44):**  But when it comes to water, we need to take the blinders off and start to look differently  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:52):**  about where can I get water?  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:55):**  Where can I cut my use of water?  
**[0:41:57-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:41:57):**  How much can be done inside of individual factories and buildings and so forth?  
**[0:42:04-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:04):**  And then it starts to form a solution matrix that's part of a larger ecosystem that says  
**[0:42:12-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:12):**  climate change is the big driver and I'm going to have to respond to a hotter, drier environment,  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:21):**  which by the way, also means more air conditioning, which means more water use for evaporation,  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:27):**  right?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:28):**  Because ultimately every air conditioning system evaporates water.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:33):**  And how am I going to do this?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:37):**  And instead of putting fresh water on the roofs of all of my office buildings, can I  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:43):**  put treated sewage?  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:46):**  And then you start to think of dual piping systems, which we see all over the US now,  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:51):**  with so-called purple pipe systems, which is reclaimed wastewater that's used for landscape  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:42:57):**  irrigation, a perfectly valid use.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:01):**  And so it goes.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:02):**  So there are these changes happening, but I don't know of anybody that's really looked  
**[0:43:07-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:07):**  holistically in full measure at these systems because we haven't gotten stressed enough  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:14):**  yet.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:15):**  And the problem with not looking at it before you get stressed is that water infrastructure  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:21):**  is often a multi-decade proposition.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:25):**  So if I'm in 2020 today and I see that by 2030 I'm going to have, pick a number, 10%  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:35):**  less water, I'm going to have different rainfall patterns, I'm going to have hotter and drier  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:42):**  environment to work with, it's too late to do anything dramatic.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:48):**  2040 is more of a reasonable planning horizon for water, and 2050 is more likely horizon.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:43:57):**  So I have to start thinking about interim measures.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:00):**  How am I going to get to 2030 with, pick your number, 10%, 20%, 30% less water demand, so  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:09):**  I'd buy myself some time for population growth.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:13):**  Because remember, all of these water stressed people are migrating.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:20):**  And in Europe, Germany had to, they chose to take in a million Syrian and other Middle  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:27):**  Eastern refugees.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:28):**  Well, they were refugees from war, but a large part of the problem was there was no water.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:35):**  And this is going to happen throughout Europe, throughout the US with a hopeful change in  
**[0:44:41-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:41):**  administration this fall, their presidential election, we're going to have to take in more  
**[0:44:48-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:48):**  immigrants.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:49):**  And as our populations age, we're going to find that the immigrants are necessary to  
**[0:44:55-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:44:55):**  do a lot of the work that older people just can't do, and to pay taxes to support older  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:02):**  people.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:03):**  I think the countries that are nicely, I'll call fat, dumb, and happy today, coronavirus  
**[0:45:13-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:13):**  accepted are going to find that all of a sudden they're going to need to take in and culturally  
**[0:45:21-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:21):**  work with Middle Eastern and Saharan and Sub-Saharan refugees, because they're going to come.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:30):**  If you can't make a living or even eat, you're going to walk away, whatever it takes.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:38):**  And there's no way around that.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:40):**  One more thing I'd like to ask you is how can somebody get involved with affecting change  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:45):**  at the community or the government level?  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:47):**  Because what we've mentioned here and looking at water systems holistically is much larger  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:52):**  than someone reducing water consumption in their household can really start to affect.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:45:57):**  How can people start to make real change at the levels that are needed to address the  
**[0:46:03-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:03):**  problem that is this large?  
**[0:46:04-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:04):**  Well, of course, obviously the first thing is do what you can at home to put in water  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:10):**  conserving fixtures like low flow toilets and all that.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:14):**  But those are pretty common and they're not expensive.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:21):**  What you really want to do is think about how can I highlight the issue?  
**[0:46:28-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:28):**  I mean, there are people along the California coast who will fight you to the end over desalination.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:36):**  They say it causes too much that the effluent from the desal plants is obviously saltier  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:44):**  and disrupts marine ecosystems, et cetera.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:47):**  I don't want to get into that.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:48):**  I'm just saying that in the United States, there's only two large working desal plants  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:46:56):**  in the whole country, one near Tampa, Florida, one there where I live in San Diego County,  
**[0:47:01-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:01):**  and that's it.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:04):**  So that's a given.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:06):**  So you say, well, what can I do?  
**[0:47:09-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:09):**  Well, it's the same way that we've been able to elevate climate change and the climate  
**[0:47:18-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:18):**  crisis to a level of community concern where right now, based on what I read, communities  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:33):**  all over the world are declaring climate emergencies, climate crisis, and then demanding that their  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:40):**  governments make plans.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:43):**  Well, water is part of it.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:46):**  And so when you start talking in your larger groups about climate change and you want to  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:53):**  be a water activist, you have to link water to the broader issue.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:47:58):**  And I think politically that's always what you want to do.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:02):**  If they say, ride the horse the direction he wants to go, because it works better and  
**[0:48:08-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:08):**  it's easier on the horse.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:11):**  So when the politics is moving on climate, that's the time to hook in the water issue.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:18):**  And so to me, that would be the first advice.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:20):**  The second is look at decisions that are being made, that are being talked about with respect  
**[0:48:27-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:27):**  to water.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:30):**  And you can do an awful lot to, for example, design a better water infiltration system  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:37):**  by linking it to parks, linear parks.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:41):**  So all of a sudden, if I start to build more green infrastructure, I'm also building a  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:48):**  healthier environment for people.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:51):**  I'm also building a better recreation environment.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:48:54):**  So all of a sudden, when your government wants to repave a street, that's the time to ask,  
**[0:49:02-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:02):**  shouldn't we be thinking about maybe putting in a grassy median in the middle to recharge  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:10):**  the water that would otherwise drain into our flood control system?  
**[0:49:15-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:15):**  So you have to educate yourself first, but in my book, I point out lots of things you  
**[0:49:21-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:21):**  can do.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:23):**  In Portland, Oregon, for example, some years ago, there was a very active guy in the city  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:30):**  government who teamed up with a very smart, young civil engineer.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:36):**  And they came up with the idea that at every street corner, you could have water infiltration.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:43):**  And even though Portland is blessed with water supply from a nearby glacier, it has problems  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:51):**  in the summer, and they have to resort to wells.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:49:54):**  And so they teamed up with a program, which they carried out around the city, of effectively  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:02):**  putting in infiltration systems just about at every street corner.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:08):**  And so all of a sudden you start to think, well, yeah, it's sort of like 30 years ago  
**[0:50:12-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:12):**  when we suddenly realized that people in wheelchairs couldn't navigate cities, and we started putting  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:20):**  in ramps at every street corner, right?  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:25):**  And all of a sudden, if you had a wheelchair, you can cross the street and easily get up  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:28):**  back onto the sidewalk.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:30):**  And so these are like social engineering changes that you can make.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:36):**  You just need to have a few passionate people, some with real knowledge, and a city government  
**[0:50:43-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:43):**  that's willing to listen.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:45):**  And maybe in Barcelona, because of the government, you could do this.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:50):**  And then you start to have to really look for your opportunities.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:50:54):**  And so to me, politics is always about having an opportunity.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:00):**  And so in a way, it's kind of a macabre.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:04):**  But if you look at what's just happened in Beirut, in Lebanon, this is the opportunity  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:10):**  the citizens have to change the entire governing structure.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:16):**  And because of the outrage over the incompetence of leaving a huge amount of explosives unwatched  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:26):**  for years.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:28):**  So I think you gotta pick and choose your spots.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:32):**  And maybe the aftermath of the COVID crisis will lead to many similar interventions in  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:42):**  the public health area.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:44):**  You hope so.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:45):**  And so I think that, if I'm a water activist, and there are a few of them around, I gotta  
**[0:51:52-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:52):**  look for those opportunities.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:54):**  And then I have to be ready to take advantage of them.  
**[0:51:58-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:58):**  Yeah, that's good advice.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:51:59):**  And certainly coming from such a long history of working in green and ecological, I guess,  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:07):**  platforms and industries, it's really good to hear that you still have some hope for  
**[0:52:12-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:12):**  this kind of stuff.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:13):**  Because I've been working in this for a while and my hope kind of wanes in and out, depending  
**[0:52:17-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:17):**  on what it is that I've focused on recently.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:19):**  And you've done a good job about bringing all of this experience and ideas into your  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:25):**  most recent book, The Godfather of Green, an Eco-Spiritual Memoir, which came out back  
**[0:52:31-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:31):**  in April of this year.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:32):**  Can you tell us a little bit about what you focused on and featured in this book from  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:38):**  your large body of knowledge and experience over the years?  
**[0:52:43-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:43):**  Well the essence of it is it's called an Eco-Spiritual Memoir, Eco-Spiritual Odyssey, is what I have  
**[0:52:50-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:50):**  done professionally and personally.  
**[0:52:53-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:52:53):**  And I think the key lesson, if you will, is if you want to make real change and you want  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:02):**  to do it effectively over the long haul, you have to work on yourself as much as on other  
**[0:53:08-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:08):**  people.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:09):**  And I use a practice of daily meditation as a way to stay centered and focused and keep  
**[0:53:18-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:18):**  my energy level up, so to speak.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:21):**  And so I talk about those lessons learned in The Godfather of Green and I title that  
**[0:53:29-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:29):**  because Wired Magazine, one of our main technology magazines in the US, gave me that moniker  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:36):**  about a decade ago and I thought, well, I didn't ask for it, but since they gave it,  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:41):**  it must be true.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:44):**  And so I titled the book that way, but it's a memoir and so it's very personal.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:50):**  And yet I talk about how I've always wanted to be an environmentalist, an environmental  
**[0:53:57-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:53:57):**  activist and to use my professional background to move things forward and how my spiritual  
**[0:54:07-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:07):**  practice or meditation practice has supported me in doing that.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:12):**  So I think a lot of people have drawn some personal lessons from that, but I think the  
**[0:54:19-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:19):**  essence of it is if you really look at the history of the last hundred years in a broad  
**[0:54:27-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:27):**  context, you look at what Gandhi did in India and Martin Luther King Jr. in the US and Nelson  
**[0:54:34-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:34):**  Mandela in South Africa, they all affected major, major changes through nonviolent means,  
**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:42):**  but they all worked on themselves.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:45):**  And I think that's one of the key lessons.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:47):**  It wasn't just nonviolence as a social activist philosophy.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:53):**  It was also a personal philosophy.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:54:56):**  And I think the way I've characterized it to myself is you can have opponents, which  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:03):**  you will, but don't have enemies.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:06):**  Don't have people you will never talk to again, never want to see on the street, cross the  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:11):**  street to avoid meeting them.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:13):**  Don't have enemies.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:14):**  You can have opponents, but you have to treat them as equally human as yourself.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:20):**  And if you do that, you give them an opportunity to change their mind.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:25):**  You give them an opportunity to find ways to work with you.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:28):**  And so all of a sudden, even though it might take a while longer, if you will, you wind  
**[0:55:36-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:36):**  up with better solutions.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:39):**  And so in South Africa, because Mandela was really a driving force in making sure that  
**[0:55:47-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:47):**  the white minority wasn't going to be persecuted the way they were in other countries in Southern  
**[0:55:53-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:55:53):**  Africa, they were able to get their cooperation, et cetera, but they demanded the truth.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:01):**  And I think that was equally part of it.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:03):**  They had these truth and reconciliation commissions, and you had to go before your community, black  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:10):**  or white, whoever you were, and you had to confess to the things you had done that hurt  
**[0:56:16-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:16):**  other people.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:17):**  And you had to ask for their forgiveness.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:21):**  And through that process, which took several years, people gradually came forward.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:27):**  And now you see 25 years later, a country that even though it has lots of problems,  
**[0:56:34-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:34):**  functions in a way that probably doesn't.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:38):**  And Zimbabwe was one of the countries where obviously the white minority was effectively  
**[0:56:43-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:43):**  driven out.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:45):**  And so, I think these are lessons that we can take and we say, well, I want to be a  
**[0:56:52-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:52):**  water activist.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:56:56):**  But how do I approach it personally?  
**[0:57:00-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:00):**  Because it's easy to get mad at people.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:02):**  That's easy because that's an easy emotion to have is anger because people do sometimes  
**[0:57:11-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:11):**  some very bad things.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:13):**  And we see this in the climate crisis where the fossil fuel companies have been effectively  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:19):**  lobbying for the last 30 years against real measures to head off the climate crisis for  
**[0:57:26-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:26):**  their own personal benefit.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:29):**  And all of a sudden they're being called to account.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:34):**  But we all benefited from cheap gas.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:38):**  I mean, gasoline today is cheaper than it was when I was a teenager with my first car.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:44):**  So, that's something we have to take into account is we've also been in some way, shape  
**[0:57:52-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:52):**  or form complicit in that system.  
**[0:57:55-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:55):**  So again, it's not a matter of feeling guilty.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:57:59):**  It's just a matter of acknowledging reality and then approaching things with the idea  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:05):**  that this might be a good part of my life, but I'm going to do it because it's something  
**[0:58:10-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:10):**  I feel is important.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:11):**  I really like that perspective and I think it's really important as we go into another  
**[0:58:15-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:15):**  election cycle and there is such division along those lines and the idea of reconciliation  
**[0:58:22-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:22):**  seems really far away.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:24):**  And I really appreciate you bringing that into the conversation here.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:27):**  Look, Gary, we're just about out of time here, but what advice would you give to people moving  
**[0:58:33-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:33):**  forward to kind of get a grasp on the work that we have to do collectively to start to  
**[0:58:39-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:39):**  regenerate the systems that we operate in rather than just being complicit, like you  
**[0:58:44-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:44):**  mentioned, in the ones that benefit us in the short term?  
**[0:58:47-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:47):**  What words would you leave us with?  
**[0:58:49-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:49):**  Well, I think the first thing is self-education, whether it's learning how to meditate or learning  
**[0:58:57-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:58:57):**  how the water system works.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:01):**  A lot of this stuff we've just taken for granted for so long that we really don't know how  
**[0:59:06-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:06):**  it works and nobody ever taught us.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:10):**  Then the second thing is find like-minded people because you can't do all this stuff  
**[0:59:16-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:16):**  by yourself and some of you may have talents that are in the arts, whether you're a writer  
**[0:59:24-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:24):**  or a poet or a playwright or what have you.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:32):**  We need those people as well to dramatize what's going on and how we can deal with it.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:39):**  It's funny to me because one of the classic late 19th century plays was by Ibsen, I think  
**[0:59:47-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:47):**  Danish and it was called An Enemy of the People and it was about somebody who was effectively  
**[0:59:54-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=0:59:54):**  in a spa, a resort spa and discovered the water was polluted and by bringing this to  
**[1:00:01-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:01):**  people's attention he threatened their livelihoods through tourism and so forth and he became  
**[1:00:06-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:06):**  ostracized and so that's the essence of the play and we see that playing out again and  
**[1:00:13-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:13):**  again.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:15):**  People don't want to change so I think studying or be able to present that information in  
**[1:00:22-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:22):**  a contemporary context is we have novelists now, climate change novelists, we have people  
**[1:00:30-1:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:30):**  that are you know have all of these skills and so I think we need to make a place for  
**[1:00:36-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:36):**  everybody.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:38):**  Some people are going to be just our really smart engineers and scientists and they're  
**[1:00:42-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:42):**  going to come up with ideas and then we're going to have to vet them through the political  
**[1:00:46-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:46):**  system, we're going to have to see who wins and who loses and how we pay off the losers  
**[1:00:52-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:52):**  for the benefit of everybody and etc etc and this is all practical work but I think you  
**[1:00:58-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:00:58):**  have to come at it with a spirit of inclusion and kind of the opposite of the cancel culture  
**[1:01:05-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:05):**  that's rampant right now.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:08):**  You have to allow people to disagree with you but keep the dialogue open so to me make  
**[1:01:14-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:14):**  a place for everybody, do your own work and also I tell people in the book I have an epilogue  
**[1:01:22-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:22):**  for climate crisis activists for young people, spend time in nature don't forget you're doing  
**[1:01:29-1:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:29):**  this not just for yourself but for other species and for the health of the planet and for future  
**[1:01:36-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:36):**  generations so you should spend some time in nature regenerating yourself.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:42):**  The Japanese have a whole practice they call forest bathing and you know when I lived in  
**[1:01:48-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:48):**  Germany when I was a student I noticed that every town has their own woods around it which  
**[1:01:54-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:01:54):**  they may manage to preserve and most people will spend some time if not every Sunday out  
**[1:02:02-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:02):**  walking in the woods and that creates a link between nature and city that keeps the political  
**[1:02:10-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:10):**  balance in favor of protecting nature and so I think it's a large part of these changes  
**[1:02:16-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:16):**  all over our cultural and I think you have to with cultural change we have to make it  
**[1:02:23-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:23):**  faster we have to make change faster then we're going to change cultures because normally  
**[1:02:29-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:29):**  you change cultures when the old people die off and the young people with new ideas do  
**[1:02:34-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:34):**  new things right and we can't we don't have that luxury in this century the climate crisis  
**[1:02:41-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:41):**  is driving us to have to change culture faster than human beings have ever done that and  
**[1:02:48-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:48):**  that to me is the argument of the broad aspect of the community and for understanding that  
**[1:02:58-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:02:58):**  this takes time and it involves language and habits and preferences things that are not  
**[1:03:05-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:05):**  technical and I think that's the hard part for technical people to get is that you've  
**[1:03:10-1:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:10):**  got to learn other languages and fortunately in my life I've been able to be a communicator  
**[1:03:19-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:19):**  for these things and so that has made me more effective by understanding how to switch language  
**[1:03:27-1:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:27):**  it doesn't mean you don't believe in things it means that you have different ways to talk  
**[1:03:32-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:32):**  about it based on the audience.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:36):**  Good words to leave on Jerry can you tell our listeners how they can find more of your  
**[1:03:40-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:40):**  work your books and how they can get in contact?  
**[1:03:44-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:44):**  Well the new book The Memoir you go to jerryudelson.net that's the website for the book the other  
**[1:03:50-1:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:50):**  books if you just google me I promise I won't be insulted just google Jerry Udelson you'll  
**[1:03:57-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:03:57):**  see the books are going Amazon and look for them the memoir is available outside the US  
**[1:04:04-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:04):**  most easily as an ebook and I think you I think people will like it so but I am I'm

**[1:04:28-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:28):**  Oliver thank you so much for the invitation for the great questions.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:32):**  All right take care we'll talk soon.  
**[1:04:34-1:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:34):**  All right bye.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:37):**  All right that wraps things up for this week's episode if you enjoyed this interview and  
**[1:04:41-1:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:41):**  want to find more like it as well as articles and other resources you can find the full  
**[1:04:45-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:45):**  library of previous podcasts at abundantedge.com the best part is that you can search by category  
**[1:04:51-1:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:51):**  topics or keywords on our brand new website rather than scrolling through more than 140  
**[1:04:56-1:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:04:56):**  interviews I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food building homes  
**[1:05:01-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:05:01):**  from natural materials beekeeping vermicompost permaculture design techniques and so much  
**[1:05:06-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:05:06):**  more before we go I just want to say thank you so much to those of you who have taken  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jerry-yudelson/#t=1:05:10):**  the time to reach out to me via comments and emails your input helps a lot in making this

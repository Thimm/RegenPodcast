**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:04:20):**  Now any of you other plant nerds out there like me are going to love this one, so I'll

**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:04:29):**  Before we get started, let's maybe establish a core definition, which is what is a botanical  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:04:35):**  garden and how is it different from any other type of garden?  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:04:38):**  Yeah, well although botanic gardens are beautiful, what we have to remember is they're curated  
**[0:04:44-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:04:44):**  collections of plants that are used for scientific research, education, and conservation.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:04:53):**  And that's really the key thing, although we present beautiful gardens, we're actually  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:04:58):**  concerned with living collections that we're conserving, researching, and hopefully sharing  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:05):**  with people.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:07):**  And that kind of covers the whole gamut too, because I know you have edible plants in the  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:10):**  collection at the Royal Botanical Gardens there in Sydney as well.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:15):**  So it isn't just rare and collected species, but it kind of runs the full gamut as well,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:21):**  doesn't it?  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:22):**  That's right.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:23):**  And we very much see ourselves as custodians of these three landscapes.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:27):**  So we have three botanic gardens as part of our organization, and there's plants that  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:32):**  have been planted for more than 150 years.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:36):**  So obviously they've got huge value because of their heritage, but we also have plants  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:40):**  and even ecosystems that occur on our botanic garden site that predate European sentiment.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:47):**  So it's really important to learn from these ecosystems, conserve them.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:54):**  And then we have plants that are there for amenity.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:57):**  I mean, they are there because they're beautiful.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:05:59):**  At the moment at one of our botanic gardens, all the daffodils are flowering.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:02):**  But they're not native to Australia, but they do give people a lift.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:07):**  And I guess what we're really about is inspiring people to appreciate and conserve plants.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:13):**  And our collections reflect all the different ways you can be inspired.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:17):**  For some people, they really love to know the scientific stories for the plants.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:21):**  For other people, the way in is kind of through their heart.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:24):**  It's through they just love what they see.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:27):**  And from there, hopefully they jump on board and help us with what we're trying to do.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:33):**  So amazing.

**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:39):**  world as they begin to discover it, just like you're saying, going into the science and  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:43):**  the history of certain things, or even just connecting with the aesthetics and the feelings  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:47):**  that they get from being around all the colors and the different expressions of plant life.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:52):**  But I'm also wondering, too, since, of course, humans have undoubtedly studied plants for  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:06:56):**  our entire history, whether formally or just through observation, when did these studies  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:02):**  become formalized in such a way that botany and horticulture became disciplines and the  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:08):**  objective was to categorize and collect them?  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:12):**  And I think what we're trying to do now is integrate different types of knowledge and  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:19):**  learn from each other.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:20):**  So each of our gardens sits on a different Aboriginal cultural group's land.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:26):**  So in Sydney, it's Gadigal Blue Mountains gardens are on Durack land and our Australian  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:32):**  Botanic Garden on Durawal land.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:34):**  And these people have developed incredible knowledge of plants over 65,000 years.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:39):**  I mean, in the Western paradigm, you know, we've been classifying plants, you know, really  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:47):**  full on since the late 18th century, once we have the Linnaean system and we have the  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:51):**  taxonomy of plants.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:53):**  And I guess we start to get the splintering up of knowledge groups.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:07:57):**  So botany becomes a science, whereas before that, you were a natural historian, you were  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:02):**  interested in insects, you're interested in botany.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:05):**  And I think there's a lot to be said for that overall world view that a lot of First Nations  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:11):**  cultures have and perhaps a pre specialization of different areas of scientific knowledge  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:17):**  have as well, because there is this level of connection between all living organisms  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:24):**  that we can demonstrate scientifically.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:26):**  But also a lot of the First Nations communities have that as part of their world view.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:31):**  And one of the really exciting things that's been happening with our organization is kind  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:37):**  of knowledge sharing with our First Nations people.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:40):**  And we have a couple of really interesting research projects where kind of strange, distant  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:47):**  distributions of plants that we've been researching with modern DNA techniques.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:53):**  What those techniques are telling us is actually the story that our First Nations people have  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:08:58):**  been telling us about those plants.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:00):**  So I think there's just a lot to be gained from that knowledge sharing and not always  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:07):**  being too specialized and looking outside of your particular research focus to see how  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:13):**  your plant interacts with all the organisms around it.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:17):**  And of course, with us, I mean, Australia is an incredible continent that's had people  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:24):**  interacting with that landscape for at least 65,000 years.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:28):**  And the landscape we see in Australia today and the landscape that Europeans saw in 1770  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:35):**  arises out of that interaction and the cultural practices that First Nations people had for  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:41):**  managing landscapes.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:43):**  So for me, it's really exciting to take that perspective and it's really exciting to sort  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:49):**  of change the maybe the way people think about Australian plants and Australian landscapes.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:54):**  Indeed.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:55):**  And you've kind of already touched on part of it already, but how has the practice of  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:09:59):**  horticulture and botany evolved since sort of the late 1800s, like you mentioned from  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:06):**  being what you called before now, like a stamp collecting sort of mentality, just catch them  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:10):**  all kind of a Pokémon run around trying to grab every plant that you can to something  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:15):**  that's more integrated with the entirety of an ecosystem that allows these plants to survive,  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:20):**  survive and communicate and grow together?  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:23):**  Yeah, that's really important.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:25):**  I mean, I think they're obviously the history of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney starts in  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:30):**  1816, and we're part of that transnational global exchange of plants, which is partly  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:37):**  for economics, but as you said, it's also partly for creating these taxonomic collections  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:43):**  to try, if you like, to work out those morphological relationships of plants.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:48):**  And I think we now look very much more at an ecosystem level.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:52):**  So how plants integrate into environments and how we actually conserve those environments  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:10:58):**  and particularly with climate change bringing such rapid changes.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:02):**  What can we do to ensure the resilience of those environments as the climate changes?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:08):**  And then I think the other thing that's really changed is we look very differently or we  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:12):**  have very different tools to see how plants have been related to each other historically  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:19):**  or over deep time.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:21):**  So the phylogeny of plants is really bringing up all these new relationships that morphologically  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:27):**  we wouldn't have predicted.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:28):**  So, for instance, one of the closest relatives of our Australian proteaceae, which includes  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:33):**  banksias and grevilleas and really plants that make the Australian flora unique.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:39):**  Turns out one of their closest relatives is the lotus.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:43):**  So the sacred lotus or Nalombo.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:45):**  And that's that's come out through the kind of DNA research which has allowed us to remap  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:51):**  those families.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:52):**  So I think there's those two things operating together.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:11:57):**  But I think the DNA research has given us incredible tools for better understanding  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:02):**  plants, but importantly also for better conserving them.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:06):**  So it's not just about putting them in their little box.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:10):**  It's working out how they relate to all the other organisms around them now.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:14):**  But historically, how have they changed and related to other plants alive today or many  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:20):**  plants that are now extinct?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:22):**  Well, let's go into that a little bit, because in the last couple hundred years, plants have  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:27):**  traveled across the globe in a way that was never possible before with the expansion,  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:32):**  colonization and movement of humans as well.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:35):**  This has caused some massive disruptions in native plant populations.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:41):**  And there's so many things that have come out of this.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:44):**  What have you started to observe in this approach of ecosystem curation rather than just bringing  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:50):**  plants and putting them in isolated exhibitions that can be understood from perhaps an invasive  
**[0:12:57-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:12:57):**  or non-native plants mentality that so many, let's say, natural parks or fights against  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:05):**  these expansions are currently being dealt with in different parts of the world?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:10):**  Yeah, well, Australia has obviously been isolated for a very long time.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:15):**  So let's say at least 37 million years.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:18):**  We've pretty much been on our own with a couple of occasional land bridges, which has allowed  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:22):**  the Australian flora to evolve in isolation.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:26):**  And we are also a continent.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:28):**  So we've got a kind of diversification of species to adapt to all these different ecological  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:34):**  niches.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:36):**  And you're very right.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:37):**  That has been disrupted in many cases by the introduction of plants from other places.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:44):**  And we do have issues with some weed species colonising those areas, which is, you know,  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:53):**  it is a massive issue at a continent wide level.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:13:58):**  But I think one of the other things that is perhaps interesting for where we're heading  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:03):**  now is really just trying to understand through climate modelling what's happening, what's  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:09):**  likely to happen to our climate.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:11):**  We have plants that are distributed across a lot of ecological niches.

**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:21):**  and renew and revegetate areas that, you know, we have been able to clear weeds or we're  
**[0:14:27-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:27):**  working to clear weeds from or restore old farmland through regenerative practices.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:35):**  What sort of plants should we plant in there when we're modelling 150 years ahead?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:41):**  And maybe and this is we have a group called Restore and Renew who work within the gardens  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:46):**  who sample across different geological ranges of particular species and then model climate  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:52):**  changes in areas that have been revegetated to try and map the occurrence of that species  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:14:58):**  that will best match that climate as it changes.

**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:06):**  just planting species that used to be there back in that place.

**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:24):**  It's an enormous job.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:26):**  And I do think in Australia in particular, we're really just starting to come to terms  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:32):**  with one, the impact of climate change and two, just understanding how the landscapes  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:39):**  that we inherited were managed before Europeans arrived.

**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:49):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:50):**  And what are some of the predictions that these models are coming up with?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:54):**  I'm sure this is somewhat unique to what's going on in Australia, but I'm sure you've  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:15:59):**  seen some from other parts of the world and continents.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:03):**  What have you been able to understand from where climate change is taking the patterns  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:08):**  that kind of govern what thrives and survives in different areas?  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:13):**  Yeah, well, a particular interest for me is Australian rainforest flora.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:17):**  It makes up a small amount of the continent.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:19):**  And we have rainforest plants that only grow above, say, 900 metres.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:25):**  Now, Australia doesn't have mountains really in the world sense.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:29):**  And, you know, if we look at ecological history as big climate changes happened over broad  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:37):**  time, plants have moved up that altitude and or gradient.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:44):**  So these plants have gone a little bit higher because it's still cool up there as the lower  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:48):**  parts have got hotter.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:49):**  In the case of some of these plants, there's nowhere to go.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:53):**  So there's nowhere higher up on the altitude gradient to escape the kind of temperature  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:58):**  change we're modelling.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:16:59):**  So we have a project looking at 90 of these species, introducing them into different latitudinal  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:06):**  locations.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:07):**  So we're accepting altitudinally they can't go up any higher, but maybe they can grow  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:13):**  in more southern parts of Australia.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:15):**  They've never had the opportunity to get their seed there through their own means for various  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:20):**  reasons.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:21):**  So they have good enough seed distribution to move into those southern areas.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:25):**  And maybe if the climate change was much slower, perhaps that would happen and has happened  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:30):**  historically.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:31):**  But maybe we can start to investigate whether we can translocate some of those populations  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:36):**  to more southern latitudes where the temperature starts to match a little bit more what they've  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:42):**  adapted to over a long time in those montane or mountain rainforest.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:47):**  So that's, I guess, just one small snippet of the kind of investigations that need to  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:54):**  be done.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:17:55):**  And we're expecting, obviously, extreme weather events to get more common, but we're also  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:02):**  expecting in a lot of places a general drying, increasing in heat and particularly increasing  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:07):**  in extreme heat events.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:08):**  So it's really part of looking at wild populations, but also looking at our plant populations.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:15):**  So the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, has been around for over 200 years.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:21):**  Some of those plants are 200 years old.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:24):**  What can we expect 200 years from now at the Botanic Gardens in Sydney?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:28):**  And part of our living collection strategy and planning is to start modelling that and  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:33):**  to think about, well, we've got these wonderful collections of these kind of plants, but in  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:39):**  200 years time, maybe our collections will look very different because we're looking  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:43):**  at a different climate.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:45):**  And one of the things that comes to mind when you talk about these efforts of translocating  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:49):**  plants to see if they can survive at different latitudes.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:18:53):**  I mean, Australia is a stark example of what moving species around and reintroducing non-native  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:00):**  species can do in a catastrophic sense as well, kind of like what we talked about earlier.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:05):**  What are you doing to ensure that reintroduction of species where they haven't traditionally  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:10):**  grown doesn't result in an ecological disaster?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:14):**  Well, I mean, it's generally what's done is actually at this stage mapping species with  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:20):**  a big geographical range and finding the locations where they're best matched to that climate  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:25):**  change.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:26):**  So it's still the same species, but, you know, you're looking at the species maybe from a  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:30):**  more northern latitude than a southern latitude.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:34):**  For some cases, it really is just about ensuring that we conserve the genetic diversity of  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:40):**  those plants.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:41):**  So it might be a translocated population, which is never wild.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:46):**  It's a translocated population that always has some level of intervention.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:51):**  And I guess in the case of seed banking and germplasm banking, we're actually we're banking  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:19:57):**  the genetic material for the future.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:01):**  So whether that be seed or germplasm, we're really just making sure that as many of the  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:07):**  rare plants in particularly the state I live in, New South Wales, but also all over Australia  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:13):**  have been banked in an institution like our plant bank facility and partner institutions  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:19):**  all around the world.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:20):**  So that, yeah, we ensure that genetic material survives in a worst case scenario.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:28):**  And I agree that that effort is essential.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:30):**  Can you talk more about what the process is and perhaps even what some of the facilities  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:35):**  look like of storing things like germplasm and seed to ensure that, I mean, you know,  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:41):**  all of it has a certain shelf life and must be stored carefully, because the idea is not  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:45):**  just to have it, it's to be able to give it life again.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:48):**  What does that process look like?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:51):**  So the first thing is collecting.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:52):**  So we're just getting teams ready again now to start sending out as spring hits the east  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:20:58):**  coast of Australia and we start to get seed production in late spring and summer.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:03):**  It's very targeted.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:05):**  So we look at, you know, the first thing is we're looking at rare and threatened flora,  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:12):**  but we're also looking at isolated occurrences of particular species.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:16):**  So it may not be rare, but it has this really weird population, 500 kilometres from the

**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:26):**  Now, for a lot of, I guess, the traditional Australian plants we think of, like eucalyptus  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:32):**  and acacias and banksias, they respond quite well to traditional techniques, which involves  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:39):**  essentially bringing the seed in, cleaning it, drying it, freezing it, storing it at  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:45):**  very low temperatures and then depending on the species on a regular cycle, bringing out  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:52):**  some of the seed and testing it for seed viability.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:21:57):**  So over the last few years, our team at Plant Bank have published guidelines for Australian  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:04):**  species on how to store seed.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:07):**  But there's some that we call recalcitrant.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:09):**  So these are seeds that either won't dry or, you know, if you do dry them, you can't germinate  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:17):**  them or you can't freeze them.

**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:25):**  temperature that we can find.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:26):**  Maybe there is a happy temperature for that particular species.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:30):**  But in the interim, for some of those, we store them essentially as tissue cultured  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:35):**  plants.

**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:41):**  in a flask and do it again.

**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:47):**  It's resource intensive.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:48):**  It takes up a lot of space as a pet composed to drying a bunch of seed and storing them  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:53):**  in a freezer.

**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:22:59):**  have yet a way to store the seeds.

**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:07):**  This is really remarkable and I think important to know about because these conservation efforts  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:13):**  are becoming more essential every year as we lose genetic diversity.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:19):**  Biodiversity is going down across the world.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:21):**  And fortunately, there are these concerted efforts to maintain this genetic diversity  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:26):**  and see that it can be propagated out in the future.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:30):**  Now, one of the things that you mentioned just before we started is that you're one  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:34):**  of the last generations of people who have stayed in a career path quite as long as you  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:39):**  have.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:40):**  And in 30 years of working with this botanical garden, I'm curious to know what you have  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:44):**  seen not only evolve in the way that you curate these collections, much like you talked about  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:50):**  looking at more of an ecosystem perspective and incorporating indigenous knowledge, but  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:23:55):**  what other key observations or differences have you seen evolve from this science and  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:00):**  the park itself in your tenure there?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:04):**  Yeah, well, I think for our organization, we've really grown.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:09):**  So in that 30 years, we had two satellite botanic gardens, which are now fully fledged  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:16):**  botanic gardens in their own right.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:18):**  But we work across all three sides.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:21):**  And I think, you know, we've seen probably like your city in Barcelona, we've seen Sydney  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:28):**  sprawl.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:29):**  So their satellite gardens are now surrounded by large urban centres.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:33):**  So they're fulfilling a function for those people that I guess the Sydney gardens is  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:37):**  fulfilled for 200 years.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:40):**  So I think that's really important.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:42):**  I think you get peaks and troughs in community interest in plants and you know, COVID has  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:50):**  caused another peak.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:52):**  People have, you know, I guess kind of had to retreat to a much more restricted world  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:24:59):**  and they've sort of taken plants with them.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:01):**  And we've seen this real boom in young people embracing plants, mostly as indoor plants  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:06):**  or the sort of tropical look plants.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:09):**  But I see that as a fantastic thing, because I do think before that we were probably, you  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:15):**  know, we were on the downward run with where people sort of saw plants as kind of background  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:20):**  wallpaper.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:21):**  They weren't engaging so much with plants, more with animals.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:25):**  But I think we've seen a turnaround in that.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:27):**  And it's really up to us to maximise that, because I think the other space where we've  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:32):**  started to work is in building communities around gardens and building better mental  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:39):**  health around interactions with nature and plants.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:42):**  So we have an outreach team that builds community gardens, particularly in underprivileged parts  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:47):**  of the city, working with at risk children and kind of connecting these communities around  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:53):**  a shared interest in a garden.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:25:56):**  And again, I think just I guess a lot of us who've been involved in this world, this sort  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:01):**  of plant world for a long time know that takes place.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:04):**  But I think now there's some real initiatives coming out of Botanic Gardens to embrace community,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:11):**  get them involved in our gardens, but also help them build their own gardens.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:15):**  I think that connection between people and plants is really strong at the moment and  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:21):**  really important.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:23):**  That's really fantastic to hear because, yeah, I can imagine it goes in ebbs and flows depending  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:27):**  on what's happening in the culture.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:28):**  There's been such a big part of your job is introducing people to the fascinating world  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:32):**  of plants.

**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:39):**  working knowledge, maybe back from grade school is what they're working with, to re-engage  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:44):**  with just how beautiful and connected this world of plants is, even if we can't see it  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:49):**  moving and quite as dynamic as maybe we're used to in zoos and observing animals.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:26:54):**  Yeah, I think, you know, touch, smell, sex and death, they're the four things that really  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:00):**  work for some people.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:02):**  You know, they learn in a different sensory way, in a tactile way.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:06):**  And, you know, we get lots of overseas visitors and you can really, you know, and I know I've  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:11):**  done some walks with vision impaired people and they can really understand what's going

**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:21):**  plants, maybe some of our food plants.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:23):**  They touch the leaves, they're soft, they start to understand they need more water and  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:27):**  then you take them to a part of the garden where we're growing Sydney local plants and  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:32):**  they're prickly and they have really tough leaves.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:35):**  And then I think for other people, and this is one of the things we really do with our  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:40):**  volunteer guides groups, is we see them as storytellers.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:44):**  I mean, we like to say that every plant in our collection has a story to tell.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:49):**  And, you know, just like on the television or Netflix, it's the stories about sex and  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:54):**  the stories about death that really sell.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:57):**  And the plant world is full of stories about sex.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:27:59):**  You know, we've got our wonderful fig wasps that pollinate our figs and all around Sydney,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:05):**  we've got little orchids that have co-evolved with wasps.

**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:20):**  with a part of the gardens.

**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:27):**  carnivorous plants.

**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:35):**  which is the teenage boy.

**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:41):**  interested.

**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:45):**  fight back.

**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:51):**  meeting a group and then thinking through.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:54):**  So how are they understanding the world?  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:56):**  What's the thing that appeals to them?  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:28:58):**  And then, you know, with a plant collection of twenty five thousand plants, over eight  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:02):**  and a half thousand different species, it's going to be a plant somewhere there that appeals  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:07):**  to that group or to those people.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:10):**  Yeah, that's and then there's nothing better than taking people on that journey.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:15):**  There really is nothing better than seeing their face light up or, you know, them laugh  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:20):**  or just be shocked and appalled by what they've just heard about, you know, an orchid that  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:24):**  smells like a thousand rotting elephants.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:27):**  You know, that's impressive.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:29):**  And so, yeah, that's amazing.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:31):**  And there is such diversity that there's something for everybody, regardless of how much they  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:36):**  know or what senses they connect with most to really find a plant that opens that world  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:41):**  to them.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:43):**  And that's something that we were just discussing a second ago was just how diverse and broad  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:49):**  not only the different forms of life in the plant world are, but also the senses and the  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:54):**  way that they interact with the environment around them are.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:29:57):**  And yet throughout history, because of limited observation and tools and quite frankly, it's  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:03):**  not paying enough attention, we have, especially, I guess, in the Western world, associated  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:09):**  plants with the lowest form of life, you know, to be at a vegetative state is to be hanging  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:15):**  on to only the absolute essence of life without anything complex within it.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:20):**  Yet that is not representative at all of the senses, the intelligence, the feeling that  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:25):**  the plant world has.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:26):**  And I'm only just starting to learn about this.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:29):**  You've been interacting with it for 30 years.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:32):**  What can you say to people who are unfamiliar with just how broad of a way that plants interact  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:38):**  with and sense the world around them?  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:42):**  Yeah, I think, again, it's getting out of this idea that plants occur in isolation,  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:49):**  that they are connected through all sorts of other organisms, both with each other,  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:55):**  but with larger organisms as well.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:30:59):**  I think, you know, there's been a lot of excitement around some of the research done out of the  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:04):**  Northern Hemisphere about trees communicating with each other.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:08):**  And that's just fantastic because what it's it really has opened up to people.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:13):**  And it's almost like the conversion experience.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:17):**  People have gone from, yeah, plants just sit there and they do nothing to, oh, my God,  
**[0:31:20-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:20):**  the whole forest is talking to each other and trees are communicating and they know  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:24):**  what's about to happen.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:25):**  So I think one, this is it is very exciting to think there are those relationships and  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:34):**  we're getting much better at drawing them out and also that we're dependent on those  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:40):**  relationships ourselves.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:42):**  So I think that, yeah, that we've got a lot of skin in the game.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:48):**  We often say, you know, kind of no plants, no people, you know, but now we're also saying,  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:53):**  you know, no fungi, no plants.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:31:56):**  You know, I mean, we only have terrestrial plants because they have relationship with  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:00):**  fungi and bacteria and other microorganisms that we can't even we can't even see.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:07):**  And we have a number of plants in our collection that are functionally extinct in the wild  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:12):**  because their pollinator has gone extinct.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:15):**  So if you don't have that microscopic little wasp that pollinates the flower and they evolve  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:21):**  this incredibly close mutualistic relationship, well, then you lose the plant once you lose  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:27):**  the plant.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:28):**  What are the flow on effects for the ecosystem?  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:31):**  So yeah, I do think that we're starting to appreciate that a little bit better.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:36):**  And through understanding those relationships, you start to realise, hang on a second, these  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:41):**  plants are kind of you know, we think about orchids and you know, orchids have evolved  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:45):**  to, you know, not really have to give up nectar to attract the pollinator.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:49):**  You know, they've come up with other strategies.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:52):**  And we often you know, we often joke they're a lot smarter than the animals that pollinate  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:56):**  them.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:32:57):**  And that includes middle aged men who love to hybridise orchids.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:00):**  You know, they're really getting everyone else to do their bidding without us even realising  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:06):**  that.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:07):**  Yeah, that's absolutely fascinating.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:08):**  And it's been really interesting to see this understanding start to come into the agricultural  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:14):**  world too.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:15):**  And the way that we curate, quite frankly, the largest tracts of land that are under  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:20):**  management right now.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:21):**  It's all through agriculture, but seeing that there are much more nuanced and essential  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:27):**  connections at the base of trying to obtain a yield and get the things that we need for  
**[0:33:33-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:33):**  our own survival, and starting to curate and manage the entire aspect of an ecosystem rather  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:41):**  than just trying to extract the value from the few things that we think we want the most.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:46):**  Just like you said, the different, like, the natural world is very resilient, and at the  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:52):**  same time, very delicate.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:33:54):**  And if you start to remove elements of the food web or the trophic levels in different  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:01):**  ecosystems, you maybe it doesn't collapse, but you do start to lose things quite quickly,  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:07):**  because of all of the essential interconnections that the health of the entire system is reliant  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:13):**  on.

**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:21):**  taken away a life form from the ecosystem, you now have to do the job that was being  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:26):**  done for free and much better than the animal or the plant that was there before.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:32):**  And it's expensive to do that.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:33):**  And you're never going to do it quite as well, because, you know, it's a surrogate that you're  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:37):**  bringing in either mechanically or chemically.

**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:47):**  so much less work that you have to do.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:50):**  And the diversity of yields is potentially, well, depending on where you are, somewhat  
**[0:34:54-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:34:54):**  exponential based or limited only by the imagination and the interconnections that you can facilitate.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:03):**  I would imagine you've seen the exact same thing in curating such a diverse garden and  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:08):**  all of the elements that help it to survive.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:11):**  Yeah, no, that's such a good point.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:14):**  And you know, we always used to talk about, you know, feeding plants and growing plants.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:19):**  And now we talk about, you know, feeding the soil and growing the soil and ensuring that  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:23):**  we've got an alive soil if we want to grow plants.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:27):**  And I think that's probably the biggest culture change I've seen in horticulture.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:32):**  I mean, when I first started at the gardens, you know, once a month, you'd be spraying  
**[0:35:37-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:37):**  chemicals for nearly a whole day on exotic collections, just because, you know, the idea  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:45):**  was that they could never show any signs of damage because you're the Royal Botanic Garden  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:49):**  Sydney and, you know, everything has to be perfect, which of course, it never was perfect.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:54):**  And the more chemicals you use, the less perfect long term it was.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:35:58):**  So I think, yeah, there's been a total paradigm shift in the way we manage our collections  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:04):**  plants.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:05):**  And yeah, it's incredibly important and, you know, just in the nick of time in many cases,  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:12):**  because one thing about Australian landscapes and ecosystems, they're ancient and they are  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:19):**  incredibly resilient because they've been around for so long.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:22):**  But yeah, the fragility of them can be, you know, very, very in your face when things  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:28):**  go wrong.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:30):**  So I think, yeah, what you're talking about in your context is very much what we're starting  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:35):**  to see with regenerative farming and sustainable horticulture.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:39):**  And really, that's what we're all about.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:41):**  You know, we want to have the sustainable living collection.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:45):**  We want to be, you know, good custodians of these incredible sites as well.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:49):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:51):**  Now, because you've been doing this for such a long time and have seen the evolution of  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:54):**  the paradigm by which we're managing these things, but also some of the changes from,  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:36:59):**  you know, climate change and other threats from outside.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:03):**  I want to go back to when you first fell in love with the plant world.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:08):**  How did that begin?  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:09):**  Because you worked so hard to get other people into their sort of entry points into the world  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:14):**  of plants.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:15):**  But what was your own?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:16):**  Yeah, it's interesting because I didn't have that really as a family background.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:21):**  You know, my parents were a little bit plant phobic and we very much lived in the city.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:26):**  For me, it started when I was studying things very different.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:30):**  So I was studying law and needed money to study and got a job as a gardener at the university.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:37):**  And along with, I guess, having a kind of passion for conservation issues.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:45):**  And I'd always sort of thought that my avenue into that would be more just through advocacy.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:51):**  But then I realised I really enjoyed the process, the day to day process of working as a gardener.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:37:58):**  And that was, yeah, that was kind of did it for me.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:03):**  You know, they talk about sometimes lawyers in Sydney, they say, you know, hell has harbour  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:08):**  views.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:09):**  They sit in that tiny little office.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:10):**  Whereas, you know, I've been so lucky that my office has been a 64 hectare paradise right  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:16):**  next to the water.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:18):**  So and, you know, I guess one of the really interesting things that's happened in my career  
**[0:38:24-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:24):**  is moving from being the sort of hands on guy for 25 years into the training volunteers  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:31):**  to interpret the collection.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:32):**  And, you know, it's great to have a kind of vocation and then take a pause and reflect  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:40):**  on what you've been doing, because you're in the middle of doing it.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:43):**  And sometimes you don't have the chance to reflect on it.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:46):**  And over the last five years, that's kind of what I've been able to do and better understand  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:51):**  why I was doing things and try and share that with people.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:38:55):**  So it's, yeah, it's been an interesting journey.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:01):**  And maybe not traditional one.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:04):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:06):**  And so you've been involved with the gardens here and curating some of its prominent collections.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:13):**  And I would imagine those have changed and evolved over time.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:16):**  You've worked with different groups.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:17):**  I'm interested in what does the curation of a collection look like?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:22):**  What have been some of the ones that you've been fundamental in creating and how do those  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:27):**  evolve over time?  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:29):**  Yeah, so I guess the last collection I was curating hands on was our palm collection  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:35):**  at the Sydney Botanic Gardens, which is, you know, was certainly for the first 100 years  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:41):**  of the gardens, the keynote collection.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:45):**  It then had a lot of problems because of the roosting of a large bat, flying fox, grey  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:51):**  headed flying fox.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:52):**  It denuded the collection a lot.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:39:54):**  They'd also been, you know, organisations change priorities and the palm collection  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:00):**  had sort of suffered from being lower priority as other collections gained more focus.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:07):**  So I mean, it's, you know, the nuts and bolts of managing a collection is, first of all,  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:12):**  knowing what you have and where it came from.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:15):**  You know, that's kind of the essential business of a botanic garden.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:18):**  So that level of just going through what you've got, stop taking it and then working out.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:23):**  So what is the priority?  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:25):**  Why do we have this collection and what are we trying to do with it?  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:29):**  In some cases, its main focus may be conservation.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:32):**  In other cases, its main focus may be education and, you know, just giving people a sense  
**[0:40:39-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:39):**  of where some of these plants come from and what we need to do to conserve where those  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:45):**  plants come from.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:46):**  And I guess that's the way the palm growth collection went.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:50):**  And we have a focus on Australian palms, but we also decided to really enhance our collections  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:40:55):**  of other island florals, palm collections as a, you know, as a kind of advocacy thing.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:02):**  So like a living advocacy for the palms of Madagascar or the palms of New Caledonia.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:08):**  You know, they're in serious trouble.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:09):**  They're, you know, threatened by all of these things.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:12):**  So, you know, to, I guess, raise awareness, they do provide some sort of ex situ conservation  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:19):**  stock.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:20):**  But in that case, it was more predominantly education.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:23):**  And then you've got to start thinking about the future.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:26):**  So, you know, what is the succession plan for this collection?  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:29):**  You know, what's it going to look like in 50 years, 100 years?  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:33):**  What things are going to senesce over that time and how are we going to replace them  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:37):**  and enhance the collection?  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:39):**  So, yeah, it's interesting.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:41):**  And each collection is different, you know.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:46):**  For some collections, the focus, and particularly the Australian Botanic Gardens, is really  
**[0:41:51-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:51):**  trying to represent in a garden setting and backed up in our seed bank, the genetic diversity  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:41:59):**  of that particular species.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:01):**  So it's, it's again, really at that micro level.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:05):**  So it's not enough to just have, you know, one of these species or five of these species,  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:10):**  but you need a group from its whole geographical range.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:15):**  And yeah, so each way, it's fascinating.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:20):**  And yeah, brings lots of challenges, but you learn so much.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:25):**  And that's one of the great things about working for a transnational botanic gardens is you  
**[0:42:30-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:30):**  just, you know, learn so much about incredible places all around the world.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:38):**  Oh, I can't imagine.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:40):**  And see, I'm imagining in my head that you're essentially doing like an art duration because  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:44):**  there's so much aesthetic value to the plants that you're putting in there.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:47):**  But you have all of the variables and dynamics of having to keep all of your art alive.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:53):**  And like you said, preventing senescence and replacing them as it goes, and maintaining  
**[0:42:57-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:42:57):**  the genetics with all of the variables that can come up from weather, from climate change,  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:04):**  from, I don't even know how much the visitors interact with them.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:08):**  And if you get people like accidentally damaging them, I mean, basically, all the complexity  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:14):**  of a garden and all of the aesthetic considerations of an art duration.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:19):**  I mean, this must be endlessly fascinating, but really difficult as well.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:23):**  Yeah, yeah, I think that's really put your finger on it.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:28):**  But, you know, gardens are incredibly complex because they're living.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:32):**  And the only thing you guaranteed is they're going to change dramatically over time.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:36):**  So it's, you know, and it is, you know, one of the things I've been involved with is designing  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:42):**  big horticultural displays as well.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:45):**  And there is that, you imagine a garden before it's realised, and then it's never quite what  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:50):**  you imagine.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:51):**  But usually it's better.  
**[0:43:52-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:43:52):**  You know, it's, you've got this incredible amount of uncontrollable variables mixed in  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:00):**  with all the things that you hope for and design for.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:03):**  So, yeah, it's, and surprise is always around the corner, which I think is also one of the  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:11):**  great delights is that you will be surprised despite all the planning and all the things  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:17):**  that you're trying to control.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:19):**  You know, the best experts advising, there will always be surprises.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:23):**  I completely understand that in my own experience with gardening and farming and especially  
**[0:44:27-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:27):**  working with animals, any time you're trying to curate or design or steward a dynamic living  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:35):**  system, emergent properties, evolution and surprise are, that's par for the course.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:42):**  It's not something that might happen.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:44):**  It's a guaranteed aspect of the job, right?  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:47):**  And I would imagine that in your career and all of the different collections and the work  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:54):**  that you've been involved in, you've seen some pretty incredible things in the plant  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:57):**  world.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:44:58):**  And I'm wondering what have been some of the most remarkable or the ones that stand out  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:02):**  most in your memory?  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:03):**  Yeah, I think the first time we had an amorphophallus titanum, so the giant stinking arum, which  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:10):**  comes from Sumatra, the first time that flowered, I mean, there was so much build up and hope  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:17):**  over a decade.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:18):**  You know, every year the tuber would be weighed in the hope that it might be big enough to  
**[0:45:22-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:22):**  flower next season.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:24):**  So the first time it flowered was amazing.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:26):**  And because the smell of this flower is, or this inflorescence collection of flowers just  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:32):**  can't be really described.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:35):**  It's basically, you know, throw all the worst smells you can imagine in a blender and then  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:39):**  take the lid off.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:41):**  And it happens at night as well.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:43):**  So there's that extra level to it.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:45):**  So the first night the flower was opening, we all got messages.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:48):**  You know, it's about nine o'clock at night.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:51):**  It's starting to flower.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:52):**  It's in an enormous closed glass house.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:54):**  But, you know, 300 metres from the glass house, you could already smell it.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:45:59):**  And it was incredible.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:01):**  So, you know, as big as me, you know, one point six metres, seven metres tall, incredible  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:07):**  smell and just the excitement of it as well.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:10):**  I mean, it's why you work at Botanic Gardens.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:12):**  It's when you get those things that you think you'll never see and you get to see them and,  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:18):**  you know, in part you're responsible for it happening.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:21):**  So, yeah, that was certainly for me one of the most exciting moments.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:27):**  And, you know, following on from that, the gardens then developed a way to propagate  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:30):**  the plant through vegetatively through leaf cuttings, which was amazing because that helps  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:35):**  take the pressure off that incredibly rare wild population.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:39):**  So, you know, it's that that's why it was an apprentice who came up with the way to  
**[0:46:43-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:43):**  do it.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:44):**  You know, so, yeah, that was incredibly exciting.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:49):**  Yeah, just an amazing moment.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:53):**  And then I think sometimes there's just moments that are just overwhelming because of how  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:46:58):**  excited other people get about what's going on.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:01):**  I just remember a small boy just running to where our spring walk was and all the peach  
**[0:47:07-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:07):**  blossoms were flowering.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:08):**  There was bulbs flowering everywhere and he just got so excited.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:12):**  He was literally just jumping up and down on the ground and just ran off screaming,  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:16):**  Mom, Dad, quick, it's beautiful.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:19):**  Come, come quick, as if it was so transient that it could disappear.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:23):**  So, yeah, sometimes it's amazing things that plants have done.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:27):**  And then sometimes it's just incredible reactions from people.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:31):**  That's really beautiful.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:32):**  I've heard of that flower before and I've seen some pictures and video of it as well  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:38):**  as the description of that smell.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:39):**  But that must be something completely different to experience, especially after years and  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:45):**  years of build up like that.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:47):**  What is the evolutionary reason for that horrible stink?  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:51):**  Yeah, well, look, they don't flower that often.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:47:55):**  They're widely spread on the edges of rainforests and they have to do something really big to  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:01):**  attract the pollinator.

**[0:48:09-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:09):**  and blow flies that think there's an enormous rotting carcass for them to come and obviously  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:15):**  lay their eggs in.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:18):**  And that's the deal.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:21):**  But it's so incredibly nuanced.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:24):**  The flower heats up up to about 13 degrees above the ambient temperature and then only  
**[0:48:31-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:31):**  the female flowers are receptive.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:33):**  All those insects come right down into the centre of the flower where they're then essentially  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:38):**  trapped because there are these little downward facing hairs that stop them getting out.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:44):**  The smell subsides.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:46):**  They're all trapped in there having a party, breeding, laying their eggs.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:51):**  Then a couple of nights or one night later, the whole thing heats up again when the male  
**[0:48:56-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:56):**  flowers are mature and releasing their pollen.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:48:59):**  Those little hairs disappear.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:02):**  All those insects crawl out, get covered in pollen, go back up into the air.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:06):**  Now, if you're going to get them while they've got pollen on, again, you've got to get them  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:11):**  moving across big distances.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:13):**  So again, creating that enormous smell, you've got to store all that energy to create the  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:18):**  heat, to activate the chemicals, to make the smell.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:23):**  So it is incredible.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:25):**  It's an absolutely wonderful thing.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:30):**  The smell is pretty hardcore.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:32):**  So I know when I came home from the first time at Flower, I literally just got in the  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:36):**  door and my whole family was like, oh my God, what did the cat drag in?  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:42):**  So yeah, it's pretty cool.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:47):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:48):**  And I mean, maybe there are less spectacular or noticeable displays of propagation of sexual  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:49:57):**  reproduction like that in the plant world, but maybe they're done at a smaller scale  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:02):**  or one that we're less attuned to.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:04):**  But this kind of stuff is happening all around us all the time.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:07):**  And that's what I'm constantly trying to push myself to attune my senses to observe and  
**[0:50:12-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:12):**  have the patience to see things on that scale.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:15):**  Because really, this is happening around us all the time.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:18):**  Yeah, it's true.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:19):**  I mean, one of the high points for me of the lockdown in Sydney was going to a local cemetery  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:25):**  and seeing the flying duck orchid for the first time.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:28):**  And the thing's tiny.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:29):**  It's only five millimetres across.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:34):**  And there was someone who pointed it out to me in the cemetery and it was just so exciting  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:38):**  to see it.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:40):**  And knowing the story of how it's pollinated, it's just fantastic.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:45):**  So you're right.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:48):**  It is all around us and sometimes happening at a microscopic level.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:52):**  I guess for humans, size still matters.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:50:55):**  Those big smelly things tend to be the things that create the big impact.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:00):**  And of course, when that giant stinking erum flowered, we had queues of hundreds and hundreds  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:07):**  of people lined up through the gardens to get into the glasshouse and see it.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:12):**  And again, they're those moments where you grab a whole new audience, you know, people  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:17):**  who mightn't be so attuned to plants, something like that.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:21):**  It's like, well, I've got to see it, you know.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:24):**  So, yeah, they can be great.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:27):**  Those species can be great champions for the whole plant world because they do wake people  
**[0:51:32-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:32):**  up, perhaps in the most dramatic way.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:35):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:38):**  And so it makes me think, too, that as good of the work as the Botanical Gardens and the  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:43):**  network around the world is doing to preserve this genetic information and introduce people  
**[0:51:47-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:47):**  to the fascinating world of plants, there must be more that we can do as individuals  
**[0:51:52-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:52):**  in our own lives to contribute to this as well.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:51:55):**  Do you have any advice for how others can interact with and even help to preserve the  
**[0:52:01-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:01):**  genetic diversity and maybe even curate the introductions for others to fall in love with  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:08):**  the world of botany and horticulture as well?  
**[0:52:11-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:11):**  Yeah, look, I think there's so much to be done.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:14):**  I mean, I think, you know, in the Australian context and even in urban areas, there's a  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:20):**  lot of wild places or remnant pieces of vegetation that communities embrace.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:26):**  And again, I think that's a wonderful thing for people to do to sort of take on that custodianship  
**[0:52:32-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:32):**  of pieces of bushlands to help revegetate them, you know, work together as part of a  
**[0:52:38-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:38):**  community.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:39):**  And I think, you know, I'm a parent and, you know, my kids are grown up now, but I do think  
**[0:52:46-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:46):**  parents have a great opportunity and grandparents, of course, and significant adults in modelling  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:53):**  that interaction with plants and with the natural world, whether it's gardening or whether  
**[0:52:57-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:52:57):**  it's walking or whether it's just teaching kids what the local trees are.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:03):**  I mean, it's amazing how many studies have been out about, you know, kids have all this  
**[0:53:08-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:08):**  knowledge about, you know, basketball players and stuff, but they walk out into their local  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:13):**  bushland and they don't recognise or know anything about any of the trees.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:18):**  So I think introducing that next generation to a kind of appreciation of nature, because  
**[0:53:24-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:24):**  I think, you know, you can't conserve what you don't know and love.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:29):**  So I think studying at that point is super important.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:34):**  And, you know, I'll put in a plug for Botanic Gardens.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:37):**  They're everywhere.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:38):**  Botanic Gardens are all around the world.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:41):**  And, you know, I like to say, at least in Sydney, that the oldest community garden in  
**[0:53:46-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:46):**  Australia is the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:49):**  You know, it's not just professionals that have made that garden.  
**[0:53:53-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:53:53):**  It's, you know, it's all sorts of people from, you know, passionate amateurs to storytellers  
**[0:54:00-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:00):**  to people who just, you know, fight and care for the place when it's threatened by whatever's  
**[0:54:07-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:07):**  going on around it.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:08):**  So I do think Botanic Gardens are always looking for people to get involved, whether, you know,  
**[0:54:14-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:14):**  in any kind of support role.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:17):**  So discover your local Botanic Gardens and find out a way to get involved.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:22):**  It is, you know, an amazing community of people that surrounds Botanic Gardens.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:26):**  I've never been to a Botanic Gardens anywhere in the world that does not have an amazing

**[0:54:33-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:33):**  Yeah, I have no doubts.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:36):**  And that's such a beautiful message.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:37):**  I'm actually just about to receive my sister and her three little girls are coming to visit.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:54:43):**  They live in Kuwait where there's, you know, not a whole lot of diverse plant life.

**[0:55:02-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:02):**  to different species and my own love for plant life.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:05):**  I mean, I've seen the excitement and the transformation when, you know, they don't see a whole lot  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:11):**  of greenery where they live for the most part.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:13):**  But there's a natural connection, especially with children.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:16):**  I'm sure you've seen it yourself that, you know, they feel at home in these environments  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:21):**  and they connect really deeply because they have a patience and a sense of observation  
**[0:55:25-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:25):**  and curiosity that many of us lose when we get older.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:29):**  It's been so rewarding for me to introduce my own love of the natural world to them.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:35):**  And that's something I'm really looking forward to doing this upcoming month.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:38):**  Well, before I let you go here, Paul, can you tell our listeners how they can find out  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:44):**  more about your own Royal Botanical Garden in Sydney and get in touch with you guys?  
**[0:55:49-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:49):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:51):**  So like everywhere, we've got very nice web pages.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:55:55):**  So rbgsyd.nsw.gov is where you'll find Royal Botanic Gardens web pages.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:03):**  And remember, we have three sites that cover really different plant communities.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:09):**  So, yeah, jump on board.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:12):**  We've also got a terrific video podcast called What the Flora, where some of our scientists  
**[0:56:19-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:19):**  talk about the kind of research that they're doing.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:24):**  And then we also have an audio podcast that people can listen to and again, find out more  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:29):**  about what our research is doing and some of the stories behind the plants within the  
**[0:56:34-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:34):**  Botanic Gardens.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:35):**  And of course, you know, particularly the Sydney Garden is very easy to find.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:39):**  If you can find the Opera House, you can find the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:43):**  They're our neighbours.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:45):**  And then for the other gardens, it might take a little bit more work, but incredibly rewarding.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:50):**  The Australian Botanic Garden at Mount Annan is the largest Botanic Garden in Australia.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:55):**  It's only Australian plants.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:56:57):**  And as I said, I think earlier, it does contain these rare ecological communities that you  
**[0:57:02-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:02):**  know, you won't see anywhere else.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:05):**  So, yeah, definitely, if you're in Australia, visit not only our Botanic Gardens in Sydney,  
**[0:57:13-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:13):**  but you'll find incredible Botanic Gardens in every capital city and often in regional  
**[0:57:17-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:17):**  areas as well.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:20):**  I can definitely vouch for that.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:22):**  I was in Sydney only once back when I was visiting the continent in my travels.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:28):**  And that was actually one of the first places that I went was to the Botanical Gardens.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:31):**  And I remember, maybe I'm mistaken in the species, but I think it's the Jacaranda tree,  
**[0:57:38-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:38):**  the Jacaranda tree.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:40):**  That blooms all in purple.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:41):**  I was there right when they were all in bloom.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:43):**  And that was one of the things that most stuck with me from that visit.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/paul-nicholson-opens-the-fascinating-world-of-plants-botany-and-horticulture/#t=0:57:47):**  So if you're in the area, definitely check it out.

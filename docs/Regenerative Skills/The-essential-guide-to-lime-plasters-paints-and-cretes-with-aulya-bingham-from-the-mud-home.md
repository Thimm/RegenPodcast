**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:00:59):**  Welcome everyone.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:18):**  Now I've talked about many different building materials through this series, but one of  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:22):**  my all-time favorites often gets overlooked because it isn't commonly used as a structural  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:27):**  element.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:28):**  Lime, in all of its various forms as a plaster, paint, mortar, grout, poured floor, or even  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:34):**  newer applications like hempcrete, has so many advantages and applications in just about  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:39):**  any style of natural or conventional building.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:42):**  That's why I reached out to the mud witch, Atulia Bingham, because she's just released  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:47):**  a new online course covering everything you need to know about this incredible natural  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:51):**  material.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:52):**  In this interview we cover the lime cycle and the various products that can be made  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:01:57):**  or bought from the original limestone.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:00):**  We talk about different additives to make all kinds of plasters, paints, mortars, and  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:04):**  more.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:05):**  Atulia shares a lot of experiences of her own in working with lime as she builds her  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:10):**  new off-grid homestead in northern Spain, and why it's an ideal material for damp  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:15):**  and humid places like where she lives.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:18):**  We also compare and contrast lime to other alternative materials as well as its limitations  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:22):**  and compromises too.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:24):**  This is one of the materials that I've seen people struggle with the most and that I've  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:28):**  noticed that many people avoid because it can seem that it's either more dangerous or  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:32):**  more complicated than it actually is.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:35):**  There are very few resources out there that actually simplify the use of lime to the layperson  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:40):**  or amateur builder, which is why I was so glad to cover this in a way that hopefully  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:44):**  demystifies the practical use of lime for so many great applications.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:49):**  So before I give it all away, here's Atulia.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:53):**  Hey Atulia, thank you so much for making time again.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:56):**  It's always a pleasure to catch up with you, especially here on the podcast.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:02:59):**  I'm really excited to talk about your new course today, but tell us how you're doing.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:03):**  You're in transition building an off-grid home in the north of Spain.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:07):**  Yes, yes, it's fantastic.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:10):**  Yep, I'm in the north of Spain, that's right.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:14):**  Same country as you for a change.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:16):**  Yep, we're actually in the same time zone which made this nice.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:19):**  Same time zone, it did, didn't it?  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:20):**  It made it really easy.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:21):**  And, yep, and I'm well into my project now.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:26):**  I mean, I say well into, some people would say it's the beginning, but I have water.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:32):**  My power situation is quite basic, but I'm surviving.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:36):**  And I've renovated two of my little stone huts, so I'm about to move into them tomorrow.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:42):**  Very exciting.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:43):**  Yeah, I can't wait to see the video you put out on that.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:47):**  Thank you.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:48):**  Well, here, so look, I'm reaching out to you today because you've just come out with a  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:52):**  new course on working with lime.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:55):**  And obviously we're not talking about the little green fruits that people like to use  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:03:59):**  as seasoning, but lime as limestone.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:02):**  And one of the more essential and often overlooked materials for natural building because, you  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:08):**  know, especially I was confused by this focus because we all know you as the mud witch.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:14):**  What changed?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:15):**  What's this new focus on a new material all about?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:18):**  Good point.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:20):**  No, I still am a mud witch and I love mud.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:24):**  And I've been using the two together, actually.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:26):**  I've been kind of using their strengths, both of their strengths because they both have  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:30):**  different strengths.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:31):**  And there's certain times you want to be using lime, I think, and certain times you want  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:34):**  to be using mud.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:36):**  And the beauty here, well, the beauty why I've started to get into lime is obviously  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:41):**  I'm now in a damp climate and a cool damp climate.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:44):**  And lime is really very, very good at sucking the damp out of your building.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:51):**  And also it's a fungicide, so you don't get your mold issues.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:04:55):**  And that's actually become very apparent to me because I've plastered, in my bedroom,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:00):**  I've plastered half of it with mud and covered it with clay paint and half of it with lime  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:04):**  in the damp areas.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:07):**  And the lime areas, of course, are completely pristine, but the mud plaster has got a bit  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:13):**  of mold on it.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:14):**  It just goes to show I was right.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:16):**  Interesting.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:17):**  And you said you've been using them in combination.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:20):**  So how have you decided where to use clay, where to use lime, and sort of maximize the  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:26):**  benefits of each in their respective place?  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:30):**  Right.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:31):**  Well, lime is obviously a bit more cementitious than clay.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:36):**  And so I've used lime for my motoring, for example.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:41):**  And I noticed also when I was going around, because the buildings are over 100 years old,  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:46):**  I've realized from my farmer neighbors who've been telling me they are over 100 years old.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:52):**  And so the original mortar in there, originally I thought it was a clay mortar, but it wasn't.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:05:57):**  It was a lime mixed with clay mortar.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:00):**  And so they've been using lime here a long time, and there's a very good reason for it  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:04):**  because, as I said, it works very, very well with the damp.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:08):**  And it holds its structure for longer.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:11):**  It's more enduring, I'd say, especially under the weather.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:16):**  If you're getting rain hitting onto a lime mortar, it's going to hold a lot better than  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:21):**  a mud mortar, for example.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:24):**  So I used it for motoring extensively.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:27):**  And that was quite a learning curve, actually, to get it to look how I wanted, because I'm  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:32):**  picky.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:33):**  But I got there in the end, yes.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:36):**  And I'm very, very pleased with the result.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:38):**  And you can also get different colors of mortar, depending on which sand you use, with the  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:44):**  lime, which was something I didn't think about.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:48):**  So you can kind of adjust and get your different tones in.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:51):**  I've used it as a render, and I've used it as a render for different reasons.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:06:59):**  One reason, the first reason was on one wall, it was obviously they put the stove against  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:05):**  that wall, and it was covered in soot.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:08):**  And so when I was adding a clay plaster onto it, the clay plaster was absorbing this soot  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:12):**  and turning sort of blacky, dirty, disgusting color.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:16):**  However, lime really bleaches stuff.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:19):**  So I had a go with the lime, and after a couple of coats, then it took care of that.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:26):**  And so that soot wasn't getting through at all anymore.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:30):**  I also used it in my bedroom.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:33):**  I used it in particular corners where I knew, because the cabana itself is built into the  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:39):**  rock, it's actually built on the rock of the land.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:42):**  So you're always going to get a damp issue with that.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:45):**  And I should point out, this is temporary accommodation for a year or two until I get  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:49):**  my big hut sorted out.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:52):**  So I know that there's going to be damp in that corner.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:07:56):**  And so if you've got damp pushing behind a clay plaster, that's not particularly good  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:01):**  news.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:02):**  It's quite expanding and contracting as it absorbs the water and then it shrinks again  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:08):**  back when it dries.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:10):**  And it can cause the plaster to be unstable, or sort of even push away at some points.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:14):**  So I didn't really want that.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:16):**  And I didn't want the plaster, obviously, to be wet the whole time.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:19):**  So I've coated those areas in lime.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:22):**  I was right.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:23):**  It worked well.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:24):**  It worked exactly as I wanted it to.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:27):**  So that's the beginning.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:28):**  Oh, and cretes as well.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:29):**  Oh, gosh, yes, sorry.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:31):**  Yeah, I've used, see the difference between, you can't really make a crete out of clay.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:40):**  So if you want to do flooring, you can obviously make an earth floor.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:43):**  If you want something that's hard wearing, and I wanted something where I was going to  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:47):**  be traipsing in and out with boots, then lime crete is a better option.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:52):**  And so I've used it in, as a grout on the floor between the flagstones.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:08:58):**  And that's also holding up very, very well.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:01):**  And I used it also for tiling my roof to hold, I can't believe anybody else in any other  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:08):**  country is going to be doing this, but to hold, they have what's called tejas curavas  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:13):**  here and they're a nightmare, but they are beautiful and they are the traditional tile.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:19):**  And originally they were just held on by stones, but mostly they mortared them or glue them  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:25):**  on today.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:26):**  And I wanted to use a lime crete to mortar them on.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:29):**  And that did work, although it was quite hard work.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:32):**  Yeah, I remember seeing the post from that process.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:35):**  I didn't envy you, but I'm glad I learned what you had to share.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:39):**  Glad you learned from my mistakes.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:41):**  No, there's, I mean, there's a very good chance that I'm going to end up doing the same thing  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:44):**  within a couple of years when I find my property here too.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:48):**  It is the most common way of doing roofing.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:50):**  So you mentioned a ton of different ways that we can use lime.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:55):**  People who are less familiar with natural building are going to ask one question off  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:09:59):**  the bat.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:00):**  Why would you use lime instead of Portland cement?  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:03):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:05):**  The perfect question.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:06):**  The question I love to answer.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:09):**  Why would you use lime instead of Portland cement?  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:19):**  Well there's so many reasons.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:22):**  So many reasons.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:23):**  Let's start with the environmental Portland cement.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:26):**  It's the second biggest contributor to the greenhouse effect right now.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:32):**  Only beaten by fossil fuels.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:34):**  So the less Portland cement we can be using, obviously the better.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:40):**  But people always ask me, isn't lime just as bad?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:43):**  No, it's not.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:45):**  It takes about 25% of the carbon to produce lime than Portland cement and lime over its  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:52):**  life span reabsorbs that carbon back into itself.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:57):**  It takes a long time to do that, we should be honest.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:10:59):**  But it's slowly, slowly reabsorbing the carbon as it cures and it cures and becomes harder  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:08):**  and harder indefinitely.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:10):**  Which is why, because people will often say this, but the Rymans used cement.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:15):**  No, they used limecrete.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:19):**  It was cement made with lime.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:20):**  It was not Portland cement, which we're using today.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:23):**  Portland cement has a life span of about 50 to 70 years.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:26):**  So unless it's very well reinforced with rebar or steel or something, it's not going to hold  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:34):**  for much past 75 years.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:38):**  And you can see that in old buildings where it starts crumbling away.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:43):**  But lime doesn't do that at all.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:45):**  Lime continually becomes more and more enduring as it cures over time.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:50):**  So it gets harder and harder and harder.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:52):**  And that's why we still see those Roman viaducts and aqueducts and Roman buildings altogether  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:11:59):**  that were mortared mostly with limecrete.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:03):**  And yeah, so that's one difference between Portland cement and lime.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:09):**  Another difference is the situation with damp.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:15):**  As I mentioned before, lime is brilliant in the wet.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:19):**  It has a drying effect.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:22):**  Because it's reabsorbing moisture from the air, it absorbs it.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:26):**  Sorry, not reabsorbing.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:27):**  It's absorbing moisture from the air all the time to cure.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:30):**  It loves the wet actually.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:32):**  And it just loves to eat water.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:34):**  Whereas Portland cement, Portland cement will actually hold onto the water and create a  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:39):**  very damp feeling in the house.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:41):**  It actually wits up water.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:43):**  And because it's not breathable, like lime is breathable.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:47):**  And so Portland cement will just create this airtight, wet box.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:52):**  And that's why Portland cement always feels cold when you touch it.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:56):**  It's actually slightly damp.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:12:58):**  And it's always too hot in the summer in hot climates.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:02):**  It's actually a very, well, it's a poor building material.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:05):**  And I'm sorry that people are so widespread.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:08):**  Because either mud or lime are far superior in different jobs, of course.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:15):**  But both of those two materials are far superior to Portland cement.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:19):**  Unless of course you're building a massive flyover or a multi-story car park.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:24):**  But if you're normal for a house, I wouldn't use it in my house, Portland cement, personally  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:29):**  for that reason.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:31):**  Another reason is the mold factor.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:34):**  You don't get mold with lime, as I've just pointed out.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:37):**  And there's a one part in my kitchen, it's very interesting.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:42):**  Because I've used lime paint as well on the stone walls.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:45):**  And there's one part where I painted with a chalk paint instead of lime.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:51):**  Because it was wood.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:52):**  I was painting something with wood.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:53):**  And that particular part got covered in mold.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:56):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:57):**  And nowhere else is.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:13:58):**  Nothing that was covered in the lime has any mold on it.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:01):**  It's a fungicide.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:03):**  Mold cannot survive on lime.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:06):**  Have I forgotten anything Oliver?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:09):**  Probably not at this point.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:10):**  This is why I love doing interviews with you.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:12):**  I don't have to ask that many questions.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:15):**  Did I just rubbish away?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:17):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:19):**  So let's go back to the options that people have access to.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:23):**  Because before I moved to Europe, I was in Guatemala and it was pretty easy to get hydrated  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:29):**  lime, quick lime and other products.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:32):**  In the United States, it's harder to find.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:34):**  You mostly know of people getting type S lime or ordering it especially from France.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:40):**  Which I mean that kind of defeats the purpose.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:43):**  I'm surprised.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:44):**  I thought you'd have lime there.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:46):**  I mean we do.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:47):**  Just not the amount of options for it.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:49):**  Not the easy accessibility.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:51):**  It's kind of ordered as like an industrial material.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:53):**  Like you can't just go to a hardware store or sand and gravel place and pick it up.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:14:59):**  But here in Europe, it's quite common.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:02):**  And there are a couple of major types that you can go to the store and buy.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:06):**  Do you think you could give us a little bit of a rundown of the more common options that  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:09):**  people will find?  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:13):**  I think this is one of the trickiest.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:15):**  This is one of the things that puts people off about lime.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:17):**  And it's one of the trickiest parts about lime.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:19):**  Is knowing which kind you want to buy.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:22):**  And you can.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:23):**  There's all sorts.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:24):**  And when I was in Turkey, it was even more confusing because obviously the name starts  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:28):**  changing.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:29):**  And there was plenty in Turkey too, and it's tragedy that not more is being used in Turkey  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:34):**  because it's a big lime producer.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:36):**  But yeah, you can find it.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:39):**  The most common lime and the original lime is quick lime.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:44):**  And that's, you can find that most places.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:47):**  That is usually the easiest lime to find.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:52):**  And that's the one I now prefer because it's also the cheapest.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:15:57):**  And to create, to use that lime, you need to slake it.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:01):**  So when you slake it, you get something called lime putty.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:06):**  And that's what you want.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:07):**  So wait, let's just start from the beginning here because we're probably in naming all  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:11):**  of these going to have to more or less cover the lime cycle anyway.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:15):**  So yeah, let's start with the fact that lime comes from limestone, which has to be quarried.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:21):**  And limestone is a buildup of calcium and like seashells from prehistoric times, which  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:27):**  has turned into stone.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:28):**  So that's where we're starting off from.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:30):**  And then perfect.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:31):**  And then quick lime.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:33):**  Okay.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:34):**  And then you wrote, okay, good.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:37):**  And then you heat that.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:38):**  So you heat that limestone or it could be seashells as well.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:41):**  Exactly right.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:43):**  You keep that limestone to 900 to a thousand degrees centigrade.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:47):**  And when you do that, you get quick lime, you get, it turns it into quick lime.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:53):**  And then what happens is if you re add water to that, that burnt limestone, that quick  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:16:59):**  lime, then you get a workable material that you can use, which we call slate lime, which  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:06):**  is calcium hydroxide, which is also lime putty.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:10):**  Those things are all the same.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:12):**  And it's somewhat of a violent process.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:15):**  The slaking, isn't it?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:16):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:17):**  And that also puts people off.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:20):**  It's kind of yeah.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:21):**  When you add the lime to the water, you'll get a lot of bubbling and you need to protect  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:27):**  yourself.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:28):**  You do.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:29):**  Lime isn't toxic.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:30):**  It's caustic though.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:31):**  So it can burn.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:32):**  I've been burned a few times from it.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:35):**  So you do need to be careful.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:38):**  And a little bit of a health thing here that if you do get burned, then use something acidic  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:44):**  on it like vinegar or citric acid or lemon juice, for example, because lime is alkali.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:50):**  So it will neutralize that for you.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:56):**  So when you add the lime to water, you'll get a bubbling reaction.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:17:59):**  It heats up a lot as well.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:00):**  It really does heat and it really wants to absorb all this water.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:05):**  It loves water.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:07):**  And you might have to keep topping it up and topping it up and topping it up.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:11):**  And then you leave it.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:12):**  And really optimum would be to leave it for a couple of weeks.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:16):**  You can get away with less.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:18):**  And the longer you leave it, the better it is, the better quality product you have.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:25):**  And so then, yeah, then you have lime putty, as I was saying.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:29):**  And you can also buy lime putty, which is what a lot of people in the UK do, where they  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:33):**  have it quite readily available.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:35):**  You can buy lime putty already slaked for you so you don't have to go through that process.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:41):**  And you buy it in tubs.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:43):**  It looks like yogurt or cheese, soft cheese or quark or something.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:47):**  It looks like that.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:50):**  And mostly, when you're buying it in tubs, you may well be getting it like three or four  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:56):**  months old slaked lime.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:18:58):**  It's a really good quality product, but it is more expensive that way.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:02):**  That is a pricier option.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:05):**  It's definitely cheaper to do it yourself if that's an issue for you.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:10):**  I would imagine a lot of what you're paying for too is the transport cost because it's  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:13):**  so much heavier with all of that water absorbed.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:16):**  And you've got to make sure that when you're checking lime putty, at least as I've been  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:22):**  taught with previous teachers, if you open it and there's not a good few centimeters  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:27):**  of water, a couple inches of water over the lime, it's probably not in good shape because  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:33):**  it's already started to calcify a little bit or crystallize.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:36):**  So there should be a little bit of water on top of that pail.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:39):**  Yeah, that's a very good point.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:42):**  In Turkey, it used to come in bags actually like mozzarella cheese and it was always filled  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:47):**  like half with water and half with lime.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:49):**  The whole bag was very watery.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:51):**  That was how it came.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:53):**  But yeah, certainly if it's done, as soon as it's drying out, then it's starting to  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:57):**  cure.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:19:58):**  So you've got an issue that's quite right.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:01):**  You can also buy something called hydrated lime, which is that lime putty has gone through  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:10):**  some kind of process, a chemical process to turn it into a powder.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:15):**  That's also an option.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:16):**  You can use that.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:17):**  That's another thing that people can find on the market if they want to.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:20):**  This is what I used to use a lot in Guatemala.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:23):**  They came from a company called Orcausa and it came in these big bags, much like cement  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:28):**  bags, but fortunately quite a bit lighter.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:30):**  You've got to be careful because when it's in this powdered form, it can really irritate  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:35):**  your sinuses, your nose, your throat if you breathe it in.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:38):**  As you're mixing it, it tends to go up in powder very easily, so you've got to be careful.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:45):**  If it stays on your skin for a while, obviously you've always got a little bit of oil or moisture  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:49):**  on your skin and left like that, it'll start to eat away at your skin.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:53):**  I've lost a couple of layers of skin in the past over time with that happening, but like  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:20:59):**  you mentioned before, if by the end of the day or after a couple of hours of working,  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:03):**  if you rinse it off in vinegar or lemon juice or something else, acidic, it tends to neutralize  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:09):**  it and you're fine.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:10):**  That's my personal experience with hydrated lime bags.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:14):**  Yeah, all lime when you're working with it has that caustic effect.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:20):**  It's a balance between getting people to take care of themselves, but at the same time,  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:29):**  it's not nuclear waste.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:31):**  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:34):**  Wear long sleeves.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:35):**  Yeah, wear long sleeves, exactly.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:38):**  And when you're slaking it or mixing it, if you're using the powder, mixing it with water,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:42):**  you may want to use a mask because if it's in your lungs for long periods of time, then  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:48):**  it's obviously going to cause damage.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:49):**  Or just do it outside in a really well-ventilated area.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:53):**  It's not the end of the world.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:54):**  It's not that bad.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:55):**  No, I agree with you.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:21:57):**  I also feel bad if we don't give a few disclaimers because as I did mention, I've lost a few  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:03):**  layers of skin doing this.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:05):**  It won't kill you.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:06):**  It's a little uncomfortable.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:07):**  I've got a scar on my elbow from it.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:09):**  But I mean, yeah.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:11):**  But I've also gotten just as many wounds working with every other material.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:14):**  So it's like...  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:15):**  Absolutely would.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:16):**  I mean, splinters, think about it.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:18):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:20):**  It could go on forever like that.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:22):**  It's quite true.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:23):**  But yeah.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:24):**  And neither of us are big on safety.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:28):**  So let's move forward.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:29):**  No, no, we're not.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:30):**  All right.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:31):**  So we've got it in a hydrated form.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:36):**  It's either it comes in the powder and you mix it in with water or it's already pre-soaked  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:40):**  in a putty form.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:42):**  What are the stages for using it after that?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:44):**  Does it depend on what you're using it for?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:46):**  Yeah, it does.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:47):**  It does.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:48):**  If you're going to use it as a mortar, you're going to be mixing it with sand.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:22:58):**  And if you're going to be using it as a limecrete, then you're going to be mixing it with sand  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:02):**  and a pozzolan, something called a pozzolan.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:06):**  And a pozzolan is a burnt material.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:08):**  And so any kind of burnt clay, tiles, burnt wood, so wood ash is fine.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:18):**  Or you can even find the Romans were using, I think, volcanic tufts and things like that.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:24):**  So burnt material goes into the mixture as well.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:29):**  And you've got something called limecrete that becomes much harder and more cementitious.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:33):**  So that's a different way of using it.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:37):**  When you're using it as a paint, you're going to have it as a thinner substance that you  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:41):**  use.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:42):**  You're going to water it down.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:45):**  Is there anything else?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:47):**  I mean, there's a ton of other additives that we could talk about, I'm sure.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:52):**  You did mention that you did mention the burnt material and like tiles and stuff.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:23:58):**  Obviously you mean like crushed or in powder form.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:01):**  Crushed.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:02):**  Sorry.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:07):**  Needs to be dust.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:08):**  No, no, you don't just stick a bit of tile in there.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:09):**  I mean, it's made for a really difficult application of plaster.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:11):**  Someone might try though.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:12):**  You never know.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:13):**  I mean, I want to see the pictures.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:16):**  So maybe we should just stop putting in the disclaimers and see what kind of angry mail  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:20):**  and photographs we get.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:22):**  That in itself would be fun.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:26):**  So yeah.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:27):**  And then when it comes to plasters, obviously you have to think about what coat you're putting  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:31):**  on.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:32):**  So if you're doing a base coat and you're just trying to even out the wall and put something  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:36):**  thick on there, not a finished coat, then the size of your aggregate or your sand or  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:41):**  your pozzolans or even to the point of putting in certain fibers.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:46):**  But most of the fibers that I've heard about using in lime renders are things like horse  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:50):**  hair and unless you have a lot of horses, I don't know where you're getting a ton of  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:55):**  horse hair.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:24:57):**  And from what I've seen of people putting it into the mixture, like you have to separate  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:00):**  it all by hand.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:01):**  It seems like a big process.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:04):**  I've never worked with horse hair in plasters.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:06):**  I don't think it's necessary at all.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:09):**  I think I've heard of people adding straw, but that's more for texture, you know, to  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:13):**  give it a more textured look.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:15):**  And I think that works maybe again as like those base coat layers where you're trying  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:19):**  to fill in really undulated or uneven walls.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:22):**  Like say you're going straight onto a stone wall, for example, like mine was pretty undulated,  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:28):**  but I didn't use it.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:29):**  Yeah, that's the only time I could think of using it.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:32):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:34):**  No, I don't think it's particular.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:36):**  I mean, I think if you want that more rustic look, you could use it.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:42):**  Or you could, well people do use it in limecrete flooring sometimes, the fibres, to knit it  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:47):**  together a bit more and prevent the cracking.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:49):**  That is true.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:50):**  That makes sense.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:51):**  So that would be more logical.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:54):**  Yep.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:55):**  Okay, so we've covered plasters, we've covered limecrete.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:25:58):**  So wait, what is your mixture for limecrete?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:02):**  Because I've heard of different ones and I'm not sure of like, what you're using primarily  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:06):**  is pozzolan.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:08):**  I'm using wood ash.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:09):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:10):**  And I get on very well with wood ash.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:11):**  So do you mostly just save it for yourself, like through your own wood fires, or do you  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:15):**  have a source to get that?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:16):**  Actually, I asked my neighbour who's got a flood because I didn't have my stove going  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:20):**  yet.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:21):**  In Turkey, I was using my own, but I know my neighbours got a nice big stove.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:29):**  They're running everything off their stove.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:31):**  So I just said, could you bring me a bag of wood ash?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:34):**  And they did.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:35):**  But not, I would use my own, I mean, my stove's now connected.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:39):**  Man, everybody needs a wood ash neighbour.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:41):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:42):**  That's the benefit of living out in the countryside is like, you don't have as many neighbours,  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:47):**  but the ones that you do have are all good.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:52):**  It's very true.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:53):**  I mean, I've just, one of my other farmers around here has just brought me a big bag  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:26:59):**  of apples just by my door.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:01):**  Oh man, that's worth like ten city neighbours for sure.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:06):**  It's absolutely.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:08):**  Alright, so I know that in larger applications, especially even in commercial uses now, they  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:17):**  are starting to revalue lime render applications, but they use different tools such as like  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:23):**  mortar guns.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:25):**  And I've never worked with those myself.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:27):**  Have you?  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:30):**  I can hear you.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:32):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:33):**  Well, there's two different kinds of mortar gun.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:36):**  Obviously there's the professional one which comes with power, where you've got a generating  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:42):**  machine just pumping the stuff out.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:45):**  Which is a compressor?  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:46):**  Because there's a lot.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:47):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:48):**  Me being very untech, doing everything by hand, I never know the names for these things.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:27:55):**  So yeah, I've seen them here quite a lot because there's obviously a lot of old stone buildings  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:01):**  around here and people getting professional renovators in to do it.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:06):**  So that's what they use and they kind of just squirt the mortar into the cracks.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:11):**  But I've been using, which is probably what people at home would often use, is the hand  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:17):**  mortar gun.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:19):**  And it is a pain in the neck.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:21):**  I'm not going to deny.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:23):**  Because they've got lots of little plastic brackets that could...  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:29):**  They're expensive for one thing to buy and they've got all these plastic brackets that  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:32):**  if they're not washed carefully, if they get too much grit underneath them, they're going  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:35):**  to crack and things like that.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:37):**  So it's a bit of a faff.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:39):**  But that is what you need to do if you're mortaring.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:42):**  Not rendering, but mortaring.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:44):**  So this is applying mortar in between the stones after they've already been constructed.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:50):**  Because there's the mortaring as you go along, in which case you're putting down layers of  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:54):**  mortar as you build.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:57):**  That's right.  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:58):**  That's right.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:28:59):**  Now in Turkey, when I was making walls there, that was how I was doing it.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:02):**  So I was putting the stones and then sticking the mortar in, just as you're describing there.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:06):**  But that was a mud mortar.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:07):**  But here, what I notice is, because the stone artisanship is so good, what they do is they  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:15):**  build everything dry stone and fill it in.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:18):**  That's what they do here, I've noticed.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:20):**  OK.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:21):**  And it's quite an art, because obviously you need the stone work to be decent for it to  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:29):**  hold its structure while the lime is curing.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:31):**  And that's something we haven't mentioned.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:32):**  But lime does take a lot longer to cure than Portland cement does.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:38):**  So you've got to have this time.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:40):**  Happy amateurs like us is also an advantage.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:43):**  Yeah, it's a benefit.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:44):**  It's a benefit because you can correct your mistakes easily.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:47):**  You can try.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:48):**  And you can work it.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:50):**  You can work it as well into nice shapes because of that.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:53):**  You get time to kind of etch your render and things like that.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:29:57):**  You can do some interesting things with it because of that time, the long time that it  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:03):**  takes to cure.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:04):**  But really, it takes a good couple of weeks for it to sort of get quite firm.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:10):**  And it takes a good three months to be completely cured.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:14):**  But I mean, you've got your structure basically OK.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:17):**  I mean, it's cementitious enough by two weeks for you to do most of your stuff that you  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:22):**  need to do with it.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:23):**  But that's a lot longer than Portland cement, for example.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:27):**  So you need the stone structure to be fairly stable if you're using lime.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:36):**  Otherwise, obviously, the lime itself is not going to be holding it until it's cured.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:41):**  And so that might take two weeks.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:44):**  So with this longer curing time, how important is it to keep the mixture at least somewhat  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:50):**  humid so that it doesn't dry out too much?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:53):**  Ah, well said.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:55):**  Yes.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:56):**  Very important.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:30:57):**  You need to definitely need to keep lime wet for the first four days.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:03):**  When I say wet, damp.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:05):**  It shouldn't be too wet.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:06):**  But damp.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:07):**  You need to keep it damp.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:09):**  But if your climate does make a difference here.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:12):**  If you're in a dry climate, hot, dry climate, then then you're going to have to wet it a  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:18):**  lot more.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:19):**  You're going to have to damp it a lot more.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:20):**  Spray it, whatever.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:21):**  But if you're in a cool temperate climate, you might not have to do anything.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:27):**  And you may find that it's taking a long time to cure.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:33):**  If you are in a damp climate, you need to make sure also that the temperature is above  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:36):**  seven degrees.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:37):**  Because lime doesn't really cure until it's over that temperature.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:42):**  You definitely can't do it when the weather's freezing.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:44):**  So that's things to take note of.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:47):**  Yeah, most things that have any moisture content, if they are supposed to cure or set in place  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:54):**  but they freeze, they're going to fail.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:31:56):**  I mean, it's the same with building clay walls.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:00):**  Once the moisture expands from the freezing process, it's more or less going to crumble  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:05):**  once it's frozen like that.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:09):**  Do you have any advice on how to keep renders or plasters or mortars moist if you are in  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:16):**  a hotter, drier place?  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:17):**  Well, yeah, there's a couple of things you could do.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:21):**  You could spray them or hose them.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:24):**  You can also, I've heard people hanging up kind of cloths or hessian cloths over the  
**[0:32:29-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:29):**  front or onto the, sort of just in front of the render and that moisture then keeps the  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:38):**  render from drying out too much.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:40):**  But either of those options would work.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:43):**  Yeah, those are often the ones that I've heard of.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:45):**  Have you ever tried mixing a percentage of salt into the mix?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:50):**  Because I know that holds onto moisture and I've heard that that was a common practice  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:54):**  at some point, but I've struggled to find people with active experience in using it.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:32:59):**  Well it's a funny thing, the whole salt thing.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:01):**  No, I haven't tried that, but there's a lot of conflicting information about salt and  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:06):**  lime.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:07):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:08):**  In Turkey, they used to, definitely used to add salt into when they were making a lime  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:12):**  paint, as a binder actually.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:17):**  And I've heard other people say that you mustn't add salt into lime, it causes it to, I don't  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:26):**  know, has a negative effect on it.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:28):**  So there's conflicting information about that and I haven't used it for that reason at all,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:34):**  so I can't comment on that.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:35):**  I mean I know salt has a terrible effect on cement and that's why a lot of places, especially  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:41):**  around beaches in developing countries where they tend to use beach sand in their cement  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:46):**  mortar or even just building bricks and such, well first of all beach sand is terrible because  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:51):**  it's all round and does not have the same structural integrity as like river sand, but  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:56):**  you know there's a whole other problem behind that.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:33:59):**  But having the salt consistency in the sand to begin with is also terrible for the crystallization  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:05):**  process of cement, so I would imagine it's probably got something to do with that since  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:10):**  as you mentioned, like lime is the active ingredient in Portland cement.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:15):**  So that would probably have some sort of correlation.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:20):**  Yeah, yeah, so, but as I said they were using it in the washing turkey, but who knows.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:28):**  I mean I'm sure that they have some reasons to do it too.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:32):**  There might be in these things, the thing is with lime, we've got to remember, lime  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:35):**  is limestone as we went, if we go right back to the beginning, it's lime is limestone that's  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:40):**  been heated to a certain temperature and limestone is never ever going to be the same in one  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:45):**  place as it is in the other.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:46):**  It's always going to have some other ingredient mixed in with it.  
**[0:34:52-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:34:52):**  Its composition is never going to be identical because nothing on the planet is.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:00):**  This is the trouble where you get when your people are saying, well how much this, how  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:03):**  much is that to use?  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:04):**  Well you need to try it with your materials because your sand, your lime, your clay and  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:10):**  your straw is always going to be different from somebody else's.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:14):**  So that's why you need to understand much more about what things do, whether it's earth  
**[0:35:20-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:20):**  plaster, clay plaster or lime, as opposed to just copying numbers or recipes from things.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:28):**  It's much more important to sort of go beyond that and understand the basics, the basic  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:33):**  meaning of each component and what they do and so that you can work out what your measurements  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:37):**  should be.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:38):**  Start experimenting and feeling and learning what does what and what, if that's cracking,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:44):**  does that mean?  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:45):**  Do you need more of this or more of that?  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:47):**  I'm so glad you mentioned that.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:48):**  I mean that's one of the most common bits of advice from people that I've interviewed  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:52):**  on natural building who have any real experience is like narrowing down things to specific  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:35:57):**  techniques or precise advice and thinking that's going to apply to you and your situation  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:01):**  wherever you might be is kind of naive and you're going to run into problems because  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:07):**  like you said, even seemingly similar things, whether it be limestone or whether it be the  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:12):**  same type of tree that you're using for timber or wood or you know, presumably clay, they're  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:18):**  all a little bit different everywhere you go and are going to perform, interact with  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:22):**  other things differently.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:24):**  It's worth doing certain amount of experimentation and trial before you commit to something all  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:29):**  the way.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:30):**  And yeah, I mean that's what everybody says, but I'm really glad you repeat it so that  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:33):**  I don't always sound like the bad guy when people ask me questions and I'm like, yeah,  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:38):**  you got to do some work yourself.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:40):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:41):**  It is great because you sort of end up with people like, oh, why wouldn't you tell me  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:46):**  your recipes if I'm keeping it secret?  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:50):**  But I mean, it's this industrial mentality again, you see, because if you go to a paint  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:36:54):**  shop or a normal DIY shop, of course everything's been manufactured and artificial.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:00):**  So everything's the same.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:02):**  You put this much of that much in, but it's not like that when you're building in the  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:06):**  wild with the natural materials and from country to country, because I've sort of doing this  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:12):**  in different places now.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:13):**  And it's very, very interesting to see the differences.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:16):**  The lime I'm using quicklime, I used it in Turkey and I used it here and they're even  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:21):**  different colors because the stone somewhere is different.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:25):**  And here it's a much more yellowy hue and in Turkey it was a grayer hue.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:29):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:30):**  It's actually, that's one of the first things I heard from a teacher that I worked with  
**[0:37:34-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:34):**  in Africa giving advice on, you should check even your store-bought lime before you get  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:41):**  it and wet it for a little bit in small portions first and see if there are some crystal formations  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:46):**  on the top of the water.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:48):**  And that'll give you a good idea if it's going to perform at least how you would hope, because  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:53):**  depending on which country or which even which factory that it comes from, it could be done  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:37:59):**  differently and some of them cut corners and you know, the quality is not the same from  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:04):**  every supplier.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:05):**  And so even just small tests like that with industrial products is often necessary too.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:10):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:11):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:14):**  I never, I never use Portland cement, so I have no idea if it's the same issue with that  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:18):**  or not.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:19):**  Portland cement is pretty regulated just because it's so ubiquitous and there's, it's so tied  
**[0:38:24-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:24):**  with like building codes, especially in areas where there are seismic regulations where  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:31):**  there's an issue with earthquakes and such, because obviously if they fail, there's big  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:35):**  investigations and lawsuits and stuff.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:37):**  So it's pretty standardized Portland cement as far as I know.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:40):**  I haven't seen any real variations in that.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:42):**  But yeah, with other products, it's worth checking into if there's likely to be some  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:48):**  variations in it.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:50):**  So with that said, I know you mentioned a second ago that you have poured a limecrete  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:55):**  floor before.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:38:56):**  I've worked with earthen floors, adobe floors, it goes by different names.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:02):**  And I've also seen one lime floor, but it wasn't weathering terribly well.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:06):**  It just had a simple roof over it and it was mostly kind of an outdoor installation at  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:11):**  a place in Guatemala.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:13):**  So I was wondering about your process and observations in working with lime flooring.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:19):**  Right.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:20):**  Well, I need to point out here that I only did a tiny piece that was solely lime flooring  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:27):**  and the rest was lime grout between flag stoves.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:31):**  That's slightly different.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:32):**  However, the limecrete flooring that I did, I think you need to go through layers and  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:38):**  process with it.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:41):**  And I mean, I've got, I know people who have done very successful limecrete floors, for  
**[0:39:45-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:45):**  example, in the UK.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:47):**  And it's always, there's a set process to doing it that you need your insulation level.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:54):**  And it does matter really what that is.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:39:56):**  And the preferred material today is clay pour or foamed glass tamped down below because  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:04):**  it doesn't absorb the moisture up.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:06):**  So that could be one of the factors.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:09):**  Or so you want that tamped down first and then you want, I think it works much better  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:16):**  in Mike's, from what I've done from it, is if you're working with a, you have a slab,  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:22):**  a limecrete slab, and then you stick a screed over it.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:25):**  So you've got a base slab, which is quite thick and it may have a bit of cracking in,  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:32):**  but it's quite thick and solid.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:34):**  And then over the top of that, you're going to put like a sort of a five to seven centimetre  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:38):**  screed over the top for beautification.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:41):**  But it's all about allowing it to cure slowly enough and to let it cure.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:49):**  It does need really that three months for it to be with the flooring to be, to have  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:55):**  cured fully.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:40:56):**  So if people start using that floor too early, it's not like port and cement, it's going  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:01):**  to get damaged.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:02):**  Wow.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:04):**  Three months.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:05):**  That's, that makes installing clay floors seem like a quick process.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:12):**  Well you can, you can totally walk on it before the three months, but you need to be aware  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:15):**  that it's like still not cured at that point.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:17):**  So you can port people off and do is they'll put, put boards over for example.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:22):**  So you're not like, you know, sticking your whole body weight on one particular area.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:29):**  So you're spreading the weight load a little bit, but, but really, yeah, it's, it's taking  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:35):**  that time to allow it to cure, especially on it's again, it's climatic because if you're  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:39):**  in a wet climate, that's you're going to need that full three months.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:42):**  You might not, I in Turkey, it wasn't taking that long at all.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:46):**  It was pretty quick, but yeah, I think that's, that's an important consideration, but I mean,  
**[0:41:53-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:53):**  people, people, it's very, very widespread in the UK.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:41:57):**  It's quite commonplace in, especially in old buildings to put a lime Creek floor down.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:02):**  That's cool.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:03):**  I did not know that my only experience with it so far is like the mortar that you talked  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:07):**  about.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:08):**  It's in the house that I had in Guatemala and it worked really well in between the flagstones  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:12):**  that we had there.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:14):**  One thing that people do have an issue with much more of an issue with this hemp, hemp  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:18):**  Crete hemp, hemp lime that's that can cause much more issues with setting than if you're  
**[0:42:24-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:24):**  using lime Crete with sand for some, for some reason that there are, if you're in a cool  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:32):**  damp climate like the UK, you can have issues where the whole thing doesn't set for example,  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:39):**  but that's also to do with, I mean, it also depends on the lime you're using now, cause  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:45):**  we didn't mention another kind of lime out there called NHL lime.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:50):**  And in, in the UK, if your, NHL lime is a different, it's basically a different, it's  
**[0:42:57-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:57):**  not as environmentally friendly.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:42:59):**  And there were some people who would say, well, it's no different from cement.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:02):**  It is still going to be a lot better than Portland cement, but it's more cementitious.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:08):**  It's because what's happened is the limestone is less pure that they've used.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:12):**  And it's usually got bits of clay in and they heat it at a higher temperature.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:17):**  And when that clay, it obviously then becomes a pozzolan.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:21):**  And so it becomes more cementitious and you can get it in different grades from two to  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:27):**  five.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:28):**  I mean, they've got it down the road NHL five are sitting in the, in the store here, but  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:32):**  that that's going to be much, much harder.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:35):**  That's going to end, to be honest, in most, uh, flooring situations in the UK, they'd  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:40):**  probably be using an NHL too.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:42):**  Hmm.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:43):**  That makes sense.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:44):**  That's the type of lime that I've never come across.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:47):**  It was just one of those things that we never had access to before.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:49):**  And I think it's European because I don't think it's, it's, um, I don't think we had  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:52):**  it in Turkey either.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:53):**  I think that is a very European thing because I've got a lot of old buildings and there's  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:43:58):**  a, there's a, there's a demand for lime here, which there isn't, there wasn't any anywhere  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:04):**  else I've seen people love to restore these old buildings in the UK.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:07):**  It's very, very popular pastime.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:09):**  So um, so they needed to find something I suppose, which could handle that climate and,  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:15):**  and a bit of where and kind of a go between between the two to important cement and lime.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:20):**  So um, yeah, that's another point.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:24):**  So um, let's talk a little bit more about the aesthetic finishes again.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:28):**  I know we mentioned about, uh, different plasters and painting options.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:34):**  One of the things that I've always struggled to get right is putting in color for lime.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:39):**  Have you figured out a good formula for this with a different pigments or are there different  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:44):**  types of pigments that work better than others?  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:48):**  Um, to be honest, dyes don't work very well.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:52):**  And the problem with lime is it bleaches.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:54):**  So it becomes much, much lighter.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:44:57):**  And it's quite tricky to get a deep dark finish like you can with clay.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:02):**  That's that's also one of the reasons I used clay on one of my moor's and not lime.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:07):**  I wanted this very kind of deep, dark brown look.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:11):**  But um, what, what you need to do is just up your, up your, your level of pigment much,  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:20):**  much more than you think and add much darker tones than you think you're going to need.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:24):**  And you can add black or brown into the mix as well to, um, to give it a bit more depth.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:30):**  That's the only way you can really do it.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:33):**  And I find the best things to add are pigments.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:38):**  Um, so for example, iron oxide or red oxide, the oxides or clay, I actually get on very  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:46):**  well.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:47):**  I've been mixing some, got some very nice results from mixing clays with lime here and  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:51):**  using that.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:52):**  Are you using that as plasters or as paint?  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:55):**  Paint.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:56):**  Okay.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:45:57):**  See, I could see it as paint, but I've always struggled with the finishes of the mixture  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:02):**  of clay and plaster.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:03):**  Oh, were you talking about plaster?  
**[0:46:04-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:04):**  Sorry.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:05):**  No, no, I was talking about both.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:06):**  In both cases, the tinting or the pigmentation process.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:10):**  But when it comes to plasters, I've always struggled because it ends up powdering like  
**[0:46:14-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:14):**  crazy.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:16):**  And that's just not the finish that you want.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:19):**  One really nice thing that a friend down the road did was she put brick dust in and that  
**[0:46:24-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:24):**  created a beautiful salmon color.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:26):**  And that was quite, um, it wasn't a pale color at all.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:31):**  It was a very vibrant kind of pinky red color, which was beautiful.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:35):**  So I think it's got to be the powders.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:39):**  Um, some kind of crushed, crushed pigment works best and you need a lot of color.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:45):**  If it's going powdery.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:48):**  Um, you think that was the pigment, not the lime?  
**[0:46:51-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:51):**  No, no.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:52):**  It was the mixture of clay and lime together.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:56):**  In a plaster.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:46:57):**  I mean, I could see it working better as a paint because it's such a thinner coat.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:01):**  Ah, well now I've heard people say this before and it's never, I've used clay with lime a  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:06):**  lot now in a lot of different places.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:08):**  I never have this problem, but I've heard this a lot and it must depend on the clay.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:13):**  It's got to, and I don't know what kind of crazy luck you're having where you keep finding  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:17):**  clays that bind with lime.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:20):**  It's not the norm for sure.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:22):**  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm, I'm, um, I'm definitely not, I haven't had that problem here either.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:27):**  But as I said, the buildings were already clearly mortared with a mixture of, of clay  
**[0:47:32-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:32):**  and lime.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:33):**  It was, it was obviously these buildings here were already mortared like that and that's  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:38):**  how they were doing it in Turkey as well.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:40):**  Yeah, it is interesting.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:42):**  Must be the different kind of clay.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:45):**  It makes me think that there's gotta be some kind of binders that you can add to that to  
**[0:47:47-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:47):**  prevent the powdering.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:49):**  And I've done things like case binders, casing.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:52):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:53):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:47:54):**  I mean, I actually, I did, I did put a spot of wheat paste in, um, in the paint I've just  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:02):**  done.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:04):**  So, um, that would be a way.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:06):**  And I just wouldn't recommend, especially wheat paste for exterior use.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:11):**  Maybe something like nopal cactus, um, what do you call it?  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:16):**  Goo or mucus, the stuff that comes out of the cactus.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:20):**  That stuff works, I think a little bit better for exteriors.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:23):**  Um, but wheat paste tends to break down and sometimes can even attract pests if you're  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:29):**  not careful.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:30):**  That's, no, it's quite true.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:32):**  It is, it is more, um, yeah, it's a food, so it's absolutely right.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:38):**  You know what I was looking at, I haven't tried this, but the things you think about  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:41):**  when you're a natural builder, I just picked up a slug.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:45):**  Hey, have you seen slug mucus?  
**[0:48:49-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:49):**  How difficult that is to get off your hands.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:51):**  And I just thought, that's a good point, but I bet you could mix this, the places, the  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:48:58):**  places your mind goes when you're a natural builder, but I bet you could mix this in with  
**[0:49:01-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:01):**  pain and natural pain.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:03):**  It would be an excellent binder.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:05):**  That's actually a good idea because I've, I mean, I've worked with so much nastier things  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:10):**  than slug mucus.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:11):**  Have you ever, have you ever fermented cow manure?  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:15):**  Uh, well, I haven't fermented it, but yeah, cow manure is quite gross.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:22):**  I mean, cow manure is fine when it's fresh.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:25):**  I'm really not bothered.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:26):**  Like it's, it's got that kind of like musty but fresh barn scent to it.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:31):**  I'm not that bothered with like the fresh stuff.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:33):**  Or if it's dried too, like I've used tons of dry horse manure, for example, in plasters,  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:38):**  but when it comes to fermenting it, Oh man, that's some horrid stuff.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:42):**  And then you've got to sift it.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:46):**  So you're like pouring this fermented feces basically through this strainer.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:51):**  And it's like coming out kind of, you can see it.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:49:54):**  I'm sorry for anybody who dared to listen to this podcast while they were eating.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:00):**  That was a bad idea.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:01):**  That's on you really, but no, I think compared to that slug mucus, that's, that can't be  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:10):**  nearly as bad.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:11):**  Just don't ferment it.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:12):**  Oh, we've got a lot of slugs and they're everywhere, but Oh, the mucus is so sticky.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:19):**  It's just what it reminded me of when you said the cactus thing, the mucus, but I don't  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:25):**  know what you could, cause we don't have too many cactuses around here.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:28):**  So I don't know what else you could use instead.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:30):**  You don't get a lot of cactus in there.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:32):**  Because I can see that both wheat paste and casein, I can see that they are potentially  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:41):**  have that issue.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:42):**  I haven't personally had that issue, but I can see that they could.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:46):**  I mean, I've even heard egg whites and such.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:48):**  Oh yeah, sure.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:50):**  That's the one.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:51):**  But again, it's an animal protein, isn't it?  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:54):**  So isn't it going to attract something?  
**[0:50:56-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:56):**  Maybe I think it has to do with like how fast it dries.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:50:59):**  Yeah, maybe.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:00):**  Cause I've had, especially in the case of like working with manures and plaster, I've  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:05):**  had some that have like this immediate mold or fungal bloom and I'm like, Oh no, that's  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:11):**  going to show up in the end probably like these dark black kind of fuzzy dots.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:15):**  And then when it dried completely, they were completely gone and never saw them again.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:19):**  So I think, no, well that's, that's actually the same with my clay part.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:22):**  That's why I'm not worrying about my clay pasta either.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:25):**  Cause it's white, little white specks of mold, but they dry and they use brush it off and  
**[0:51:29-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:29):**  that's it.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:30):**  It's done.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:31):**  As soon as it's dried, it's dried.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:32):**  And once I light the stove in there, it will all dry out and then it's gone.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:38):**  So that's why personally I'm not, it doesn't worry me too much, but if I can see that if  
**[0:51:42-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:42):**  you were in a very hot humid climate, cause this cooler humid climate.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:47):**  So if you're in a hot humid climate, that might be an ongoing issue, I suppose.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:52):**  So yeah.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:53):**  But yeah, normally, normally there's so many other advantages to what you can do with the  
**[0:51:58-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:51:58):**  design of a home in the tropics.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:00):**  I mean, that's where I just came from.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:02):**  And in most cases you just leave the doors and the windows open for most of the day and  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:09):**  make sure that there's good airflow and ventilation.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:12):**  And I know in a lot of traditional building, they would put houses up on stilts to try  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:18):**  and catch more of the air and make sure that the damp from the ground wouldn't go up into  
**[0:52:22-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:22):**  the home.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:23):**  So there's a lot of really good and simple design techniques for like humid tropics and  
**[0:52:28-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:28):**  hot humid areas to avoid mold besides just selecting for different materials.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:37):**  So, well on that note, look Atul, I know that you and I could talk about this all day, but  
**[0:52:44-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:44):**  to make this a reasonable length podcast and also to encourage people to take a look at  
**[0:52:50-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:50):**  how you're doing this, because there's only a certain amount that they can learn from  
**[0:52:54-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:54):**  just hearing us speak about it.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:52:57):**  I know you've got a new course specifically on all of these topics.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:01):**  Can you tell our listeners where they can find more information and how they can sign  
**[0:53:04-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:04):**  up?  
**[0:53:05-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:06):**  If you go to www.themudhome.com, there's a, well, you'll see a stack of natural building  
**[0:53:12-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:12):**  information in there anyway.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:14):**  But for the course, if you look under where it says learn mud and look under courses,  
**[0:53:20-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:20):**  you'll see that course there.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:21):**  And you'll, there's a, what you might like to look at is there's a free preview video  
**[0:53:28-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:28):**  on that course showing what I've done with my kitchen using lime and all the various  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:35):**  types of types of applications that there are with lime, which is, which you can have  
**[0:53:40-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:40):**  a look at.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:41):**  So get yourself inspired to use this stuff because I really would like to see more lime  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:48):**  being used.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:49):**  And people do get put off for just because it's different.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:53):**  I think a lot of the time there's a lot of stick in the mud.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:53:55):**  This, but that goes on in the building world and people like to stay in the comfort zone,  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:02):**  but really it's such a wonderful material and that's why I've set it at the moment for  
**[0:54:07-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:07):**  the next month.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:08):**  It's on a special introductory price of just $45.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:13):**  So it's cheap and I'll be adding stuff to it as I go along, which I always do with my  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:18):**  courses.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:19):**  I update them and as soon as you enroll, you get all the updates that come up.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:23):**  So Tadelact will be coming on that course at some point, for example, and also something  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:29):**  into hemp lime I'm going to be looking into.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:32):**  So once you're enrolled, you're in, you get into the lime world.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:38):**  And so, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:40):**  Have a look at that.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:41):**  And I hope we can get some more people using lime.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:45):**  Certainly.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:46):**  And I mean, definitely for people listening, I really recommend this cause I don't know  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:49):**  of any other course available that goes in depth like this on lime specifically.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:54:55):**  There are tons about earthen building, different types of mud and adobe and basically the whole  
**[0:55:03-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:03):**  world of earth is very well covered, but lime seems to be lacking.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:07):**  And like you said, this is such a useful material.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:10):**  More people should be using it.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:11):**  There's so many benefits to it.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:13):**  And I'm really glad that you took the time to kind of go in depth on this topic because  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:16):**  it has so many applications.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:19):**  And I really tried because I, you know, our little Facebook group and some people who  
**[0:55:25-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:25):**  I was connecting with, a lot of people have sort of said, even the things that, the reason  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:31):**  I put it together actually was because a lot of people were saying that the information  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:36):**  that's out there is quite complicated a lot of the time.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:40):**  And yeah, it makes it confusing and people don't understand which time lime to use or  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:44):**  where to get it or how to do it.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:46):**  It gets complicated.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:48):**  And so I've really tried to make it, and I do this with all my courses to try and make  
**[0:55:52-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:52):**  it quite simple to follow so that it's, you don't have that feeling that you've got to  
**[0:55:58-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:55:58):**  wade through a bunch of chemistry manuals just to understand what to do step by step,  
**[0:56:04-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:04):**  just which line to use, what you need to use it for and how to do it.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:07):**  And I actually think in, to be very honest, I think it's easier to master than Earth plaster.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:16):**  I think Earth plaster does take longer to master in many, many ways.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:20):**  So yeah, there can be a lot more variables, that's for sure.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:23):**  Depending on what you have access to around where you are.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:26):**  It's really hard to just buy Earth and plasters.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:30):**  I mean, there's a few suppliers, at least that I know of in the States, but lime is  
**[0:56:34-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:34):**  a whole lot easier to get in, it's a lot more standardized.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:38):**  Yeah there's a lot more that I think that can go wrong with an Earth plaster.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:40):**  Or at least maybe I just experienced them all, I don't know.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:44):**  No no, I would agree with that.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:46):**  And I love Earth and plasters, but it's not the easiest thing to get started with.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:50):**  No no, me too, I love them, but it can take longer to master it.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:55):**  So yeah, there we go.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:57):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:56:58):**  Hope it gets the people into lime.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:00):**  Sure, for anybody who does end up signing up, I'm pretty sure you have an option there  
**[0:57:03-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:03):**  to also join in on the Facebook group, which I've been a member of for a little while and  
**[0:57:08-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:08):**  I love seeing all of the different projects that people post there and all of the great  
**[0:57:12-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:12):**  advice.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:13):**  Because, I mean, while Atulia is a wealth of information and has tons of answers, she  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:18):**  also taps into kind of a larger group of other natural builders who chime in on helping to  
**[0:57:23-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:23):**  problem solve things.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:24):**  And I've gotten a lot out of that group myself, so thanks for making that resource.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:28):**  Well you also give a lot, Oliver, thank you.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:31):**  I try and chime in when I have something to say.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:34):**  Yeah, I mean, it's a small...  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:36):**  I kept it deliberately small because I wanted to be able to give quality information to  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:40):**  people rather than have this kind of carpet bombing thing that goes on a lot of the time  
**[0:57:45-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:45):**  in bigger groups where everybody's chiming in and nobody knows who knows what.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:50):**  Whereas I know who knows what in that group.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:53):**  I know very well who's an expert and what.  
**[0:57:55-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:55):**  We're all experts in different things.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:57:57):**  So I can tag somebody when I know that something that I might not be so sure on, I know there's  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:03):**  somebody else in there that does know.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:06):**  So I love that group, yeah.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:08):**  That's also under the Learn Mudd part of the www.themudhome.com.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:14):**  You can see how to join that there.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:16):**  Nice.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:17):**  Yeah, you've got a lot of good resources.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:18):**  Well, with that said, I'm really looking forward to catching up with you on those boards again  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:22):**  soon and tapping you for more information, especially as I kind of navigate the systems  
**[0:58:27-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:27):**  here in Spain, which you know a lot more of than I do at this point.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:31):**  So we'll definitely keep in touch.

**[0:58:38-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:38):**  when you come out with another awesome course.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:40):**  I've always got something to say, as you know.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-bingham-lime/#t=0:58:43):**  There's always something.

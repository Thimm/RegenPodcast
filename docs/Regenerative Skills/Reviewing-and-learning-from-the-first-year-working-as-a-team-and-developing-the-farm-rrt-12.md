**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:07:34):**  and when you have time and fit it into other things.

**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:07:44):**  I think all of us are all of us are similar in a sense in that we are all very hardworking  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:07:50):**  but we're definitely all in the kind of innovator bracket.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:07:53):**  None of us I notice like to do repetitive jobs over and over again.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:07:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:07:59):**  Even though I could be years working on farms and other things like when I was working on  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:03):**  other people's farms I loved being like the one in charge of the goats or the one in charge.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:08):**  But we've moved we've moved to another we've entered a threshold by by starting this property  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:12):**  of being the ones the innovators that get something going do it a bunch of times or  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:17):**  do it enough times to be able to pass to understand the process.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:20):**  But yeah we did all come from that background of working as grunts in various different  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:25):**  positions.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:26):**  So having it's like almost now our job is to be like one step ahead of the team.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:33):**  What I'm really like getting going for me and Jareb and focusing a lot on is the nursery  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:37):**  and the composting system you know really getting that one dialed in and functioning.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:44):**  So again it can be eventually sort of like automated and handed off.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:49):**  Yeah.

**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:08:56):**  exciting thing because I think I can really see Ricardo and Miguel are two young interns

**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:24:45):**  right you know especially with new babies.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:24:47):**  Yeah that was a slight design flaw with the house but that wasn't too challenging but  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:24:52):**  the more challenging thing was to deal with all this massive surplus of milk that we had  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:24:56):**  in low season here for tourism.

**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:25:04):**  Then it two of them got pregnant by mistake which can happen really easily with goats  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:25:10):**  FYI and so their milk production started to drop off.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:25:13):**  Right when we needed it.

**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:25:19):**  that had kept us going during the low season all quadrupled their orders and our production

**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:27:33):**  15 years later he not slowly noticed oh you can't get lettuce seeds either and nobody  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:27:39):**  has a rubella and nobody has tomatoes and I'll plant these he just found all the niches  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:27:44):**  in the market he just found niches found a way of doing it and now he produces all of

**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:13):**  to be said for there's so much to be said for that mindset as long as it's balanced  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:17):**  with you know the other side that plans things out somewhat as well yeah totally and I'm  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:23):**  sure he came along with a lot of the same struggles that we've done here in this first  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:28):**  year is it's really easy to plant and grow lettuce it's a whole different thing to find  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:34):**  a market that will buy it from you when it's fresh when it's available and to keep the  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:39):**  production consistent so that you can have a reliable business model that restaurants  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:44):**  and buyers can count on that's really where the intricacy of running it as a business  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:49):**  comes in otherwise you're just hobby gardening and there's nothing wrong with that but if  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:54):**  you want to make this a profitable thing and make it part of your livelihood I mean it's  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:28:58):**  one of those other considerations we hobby garden because the farmers don't only have  
**[0:29:01-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:01):**  so many central pieces right right and ours is kind of turning into fertility coffee eggs  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:09):**  from our chickens and the dairy products you know those are like the kind of central and  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:13):**  you can't because only and we do have a nice big garden space and it produces a lot of  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:17):**  food but we just decided it was easier to make that really diverse make it feed us and  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:23):**  our volunteers and our workers and be a really good example of like a resilient garden that  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:28):**  we use as experimentation to figure out for us that what can do really well here what  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:34):**  can do well with lower maintenance what produces better in different seasons like it's a research  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:39):**  garden as much as anything right now yeah yeah it has made it fulfills many different  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:44):**  roles whereas if it was just for production's sake for selling it would just pretty much  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:49):**  only be there you limit your diversity it's kind of the difference in permaculture zones  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:53):**  I think between a zone two and a zone three yeah our garden is it is a good example I  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:29:57):**  think of a zone two garden yeah we've got some fast crops in there like our like our  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:02):**  greens our lettuces our arugula we've got a lot of slower crops in there like vegetables  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:07):**  it's a mix of zone one and zone two zone three is like someone asked me that someone's like  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:12):**  oh so a garden is always a zone two and of course he's now saying well not necessarily  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:17):**  because if it's a market garden where you're churning out you know a hundred pounds of  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:23):**  of microgreens or you know like baby small um what do you call them tender greens that's  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:31):**  more like a zone three there's a big distinction there's actually I actually said it's more  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:35):**  like a zone one it goes more with the amount that you interact with it and well the amount  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:39):**  of time that you spend on it but there's zone three it's like if it's commercial commercial  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:30:43):**  zone then they would invest in a commercial zone you invest in inefficiency you know so

**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:31:42):**  growing production or grain production or pasture yeah right etc those things are larger

**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:32:25):**  and his leachies and his rambutans and yeah all those amazing tropical fruits that's more

**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:32:34):**  he has but it's very it's it's smaller and it's very different to his like large scale  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:32:39):**  housing maker commercial zone you know i would not consider that the our our kitchen garden

**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:32:56):**  that and the in the parcel down below and the rows of perennials in between that's like  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:01):**  a mixing of zone two into our zone one because zone twos are usually more perennial but higher  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:06):**  maintenance and high diversity right and i do i i always well in my mind a zone one and  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:12):**  zone two blend a little bit you know like they can but you got to make sure that that's  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:17):**  primarily zone one and it has to do with amount of maintenance and interaction that's right  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:21):**  and how much we're taking out of it constantly how much we're putting in right whereas zone  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:24):**  two is like we're definitely mulching and etc but we're not like we're not harvesting  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:30):**  it's necessarily every day from it right so zone one zone two do there's like a gray area  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:37):**  in between them or whatever but they're certainly i think that there should be that you need  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:41):**  perennial alleys in any system and our garden has that our garden has a lot of like a lot  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:46):**  of perennial um but we got in it yeah we we i think we can we can be clear in the fact  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:52):**  that like the main zone two is actually the parcel down below it that's like pure zone  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:33:57):**  two actually going on which would be like a a really diverse kind of forest food forests  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:34:03):**  are generally zone twos yeah yeah yeah and that's because we're not going for efficiency  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:34:07):**  in that a food forest to me is different to an agroforestry system absolutely it's a zone  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:34:13):**  two version of of maybe an agroforestry managing perennial yeah yeah and i'm we haven't implemented  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:34:19):**  that we've started some of the earth wars but that's one of the things i'm really excited

**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:34:29):**  got to maintain all the stuff that we have finished the house but we also want to have  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:34:33):**  our earthworks done on that lower down section so so that we can start planting perennial

**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:34:50):**  comfortably but now we want more of our functions to be centered around uh our zone zero rather  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:34:56):**  than having to go out to the bodega to to prepare food and to eat and go off like slightly

**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:35:13):**  comfortable a lot more just easy car in over here you know like herb gardens all over this  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:35:18):**  area yeah yeah the culinary and the medicinal stuff over here the flowers and the construction

**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:38:32):**  now and in a sacred i mean it sounds kind of like hippy but in a sacred kind of space  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:38:37):**  we're usually a little too sarcastic to do that but it's it's it's real you know and  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:38:43):**  yeah i was i i was glad we did that i mean you know it's good to like leave your cynicism

**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:38:53):**  to doing something like that again this upcoming new year's because that was the last time  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:38:56):**  we really got together and sort of made a commitment to this being let's do a project  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:01):**  that we're into but also working as a family as a family not just as co-conspirators and  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:06):**  then a company and business partners right actually but you know because for me reaffirming  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:11):**  to the larger relationship that's building we are trying to run this like a business

**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:22):**  just about having a profit with farm it's about yeah trying to develop uh what we see  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:27):**  as like a regenerative life that brings opportunities for others and exemplify some of these ethics  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:33):**  even if they're not the most convenient or easy way to go for one thing we don't throw  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:37):**  a bunch of chemicals on our garden we also didn't use any cement in our buildings these  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:42):**  are things that could have made the process either simpler or cheaper or faster one or  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:47):**  the other um but there's a larger ethic that we're trying to exemplify and you know they  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:52):**  talk about be the change you want to see we can't go around talking about and teaching  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:39:58):**  permaculture ethics and design criteria if we're not putting ourselves through the same  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:02):**  criteria and holding ourselves to a standard that we want to promote and if we don't and  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:06):**  it's also important to me that the farm be uh be able to stand on its own two feet absolutely  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:13):**  because we definitely it's not subsidized by other things to support ourselves to an  
**[0:40:17-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:17):**  extent teaching and and consulting and designing but i didn't i i think we were all agreed  
**[0:40:23-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:23):**  on that none of us wanted to have this kind of like sort of showcase that was just really  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:31):**  you know propped up propped up by by teaching courses right you know because that's to me  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:35):**  that's a bit of a kind of a pyramid scheme it's like oh yeah start your permaculture  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:40):**  uh center and you can teach courses and make money on that and you think well everyone  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:45):**  can't do that right yeah yeah and this structure emerges really easily from not having a clear  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:51):**  set of goals right yeah i see it all the time it's like no one really i don't think anyone  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:40:57):**  really decides that this is like i want to have a demonstration boutique nothing happening  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:04):**  really far right no one wants that but it happens all the time because goals aren't  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:09):**  like properly expressed and i think there's also sometimes a little bit of a misunderstanding  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:14):**  of how how um labor intensive some of these systems are you know so it's like that's what  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:21):**  it is i think it people get into it with a lot of idealism yeah and you know until you  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:26):**  work the land practically all of us have worked on commercial farms before this haven't we  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:32):**  yeah yeah there's definitely been a lead up to this the singularity i'll call it of like  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:37):**  us coming together and like it's exploding from it a lot uh led up to at least for my  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:43):**  life yeah i mean i worked in commercial farms and commercial construction sites for many  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:49):**  many years before i got into natural building and permaculture and one of the things that  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:54):**  i think is too often thrown away is this idea that well because we're trying to do something  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:41:58):**  fundamentally different from either of those you know industries that we just throw out  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:04):**  everything throw the baby out with the bath water so to speak whereas there's a lot to  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:08):**  be learned from the efficiency of those systems the business models and you know the way that  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:14):**  they prepare manage and track progress yeah that is totally worth keeping absolutely and  
**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:21):**  then just changing the goals and and the ethics behind it can transform the way it interacts  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:28):**  with the environment the ecology and the community but definitely not getting rid of all of the  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:33):**  things that have caused those enterprises to be so successful and dominant yeah yeah  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:37):**  to work it's almost there is definitely a sense i think in the permaculture community  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:41):**  that kind of money and business is like a dirty word but right for me actually understanding  
**[0:42:45-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:45):**  it and using that energy seeing it as a tool is very important right i guess like integration  
**[0:42:52-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:52):**  is i suppose what the key is here we kind of talked about a little bit about that tight  
**[0:42:59-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:42:59):**  web yeah that i mean because you know integrating in a sense the business um good good business  
**[0:43:06-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:43:06):**  practices with um kind of good almost like heart sense sensibility sensibilities you

**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:43:50):**  done so much in the last year we've built a house we started a farm there was nothing

**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:44:07):**  the nature of me and who i am and i think all of us and all of us yeah there's this

**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:44:42):**  decisions as a group is like no you're right that does take precedent right now and frankly  
**[0:44:46-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:44:46):**  the house is by far the most expensive endeavor on this place and it's also the one that is

**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:46:18):**  shad i was like yeah it kind of blew my mind i was we were like kind of talking about our  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:46:23):**  routines and he's like yeah you know i've just been like for years just like being able  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:46:27):**  to like read in the morning and like sip on my coffee until like seven i was like whoa  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:46:32):**  you you do that every morning he's like well not recently since i had a kid but like yeah  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:46:37):**  i was i was like wait you shad mr like mr hyperactive just machine like like churning

**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:46:54):**  do any of that you're much more scattered and less productive when you are working right  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:46:58):**  but by starting the day with a little um even just a token gesture of control and and collection  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:06):**  of space yeah we talk about all the time we talked about this and we actually have there's  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:10):**  a conversation about this in an other podcast that we've had but yeah um but it's important  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:16):**  it's it's very important that's the main thing that i've learned in my own routines this  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:19):**  year is that if you start a little bit on your terms in a non-reactionary mode you tend  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:25):**  to have a lot more focus and control when you are reacting to things and dealing with  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:30):**  my big one this uncontrollable circumstances in the guitar and it's actually been like  
**[0:47:35-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:35):**  i just had this like aha moment when i was listening to shad give a lecture on water  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:41):**  uh water on earthworks in the last pdc that we just did and it was cool because i i started  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:47):**  playing the guitar about two years ago and just like somewhat autistically as is my style  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:53):**  like just couldn't got obsessed with it and like started practicing scales and learning  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:47:58):**  music theory and all this thing that's been my routine for the last couple of years actually  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:02):**  um and i just like started getting to the point now where uh i can like really jam with  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:09):**  people and like see what see what key they're in and like play along with it and kind of  
**[0:48:14-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:14):**  do solos and licks and stuff and you know we were lucky with this pdc we're teaching  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:20):**  there's a lot of musicians and so we were just like at the end of the classes every  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:24):**  day we would just take out the instruments and start to jam you know um and i was listening  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:27):**  to shad in the lecture then talk about how good earthworks are about re-harmonizing the  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:34):**  landscape with water and i realized it is like wow music has so much to teach us in  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:40):**  this thing because music is all about harmony and that's what harmonics actually are you  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:45):**  know and they started to you know as i was i shad was like drawing up a fast flowing  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:51):**  river turning into a meandering river i started to realize that's that's that's a wave that's  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:48:56):**  a harmonic wave you know and you get the same thing when two musical instruments are in  
**[0:49:01-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:01):**  harmony you actually mind explosions and so i kind of realized this well seeing the resonance  
**[0:49:08-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:08):**  of these different concepts and so many reflections within the natural and uh our curated environment  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:15):**  that's why it is really important to observe that's why like the pattern lecture is so  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:20):**  key because it brings you right back into that idea and it infiltrates into so many  
**[0:49:24-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:24):**  concepts outside of just the direct applications that we're usually putting them to it's such  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:28):**  a powerful idea for me that that we have we humans have this ability to to create harmony  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:34):**  when we're like kind of like mindful and and and thinking about what we're doing you know  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:40):**  that we do oh this is what i'm supposed to do yeah okay and and that's why you know it  
**[0:49:45-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:45):**  feels so good whether it's like you know making music or or you know doing some well thought  
**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:53):**  out earthworks that you had to just create these harmonics and these interactions on  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:49:58):**  upon the landscape and that you at that point now it's out of your control but in a good  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:03):**  way it just starts to flow yeah also you're really just um to me that's the most beautiful  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:08):**  part of anything that you can create or design is when it takes over on its own if you've  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:13):**  done a good job you impose control and then you really good well you give it the at that  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:18):**  point you're just a support you're just helping to coax it into fruition give it the resources  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:24):**  that it needs to completely outstrip and outperform anything that you could have imposed on it  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:29):**  right and i think that's the highest thing that you can hope to a lot of people don't  
**[0:50:33-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:33):**  let go to design issues yeah they don't they don't find that they don't know when to let  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:38):**  go yeah yeah yeah i know i struggle with that in yeah various aspects of life absolutely  
**[0:50:43-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:43):**  you know outside of direct designing absolutely that's when human uh sort of mentality in  
**[0:50:49-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviewing-and-learning-from-the-first-year-working-as-a-team-and-developing-the-farm-rrt-12/#t=0:50:49):**  relationships and business and all sorts of things like relinquishing control is very

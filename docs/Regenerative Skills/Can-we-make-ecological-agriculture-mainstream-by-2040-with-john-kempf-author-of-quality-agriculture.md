**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:11):**  And I realized that if I truly want to have a significant impact and change the direction  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:18):**  that agriculture is going on a global scale, then I also need to make that information  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:23):**  available to the many people who don't listen to the podcast.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:27):**  So Quality Agriculture is the first and what will be eventually be a series of the interviews  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:35):**  that I've had with people, with these leaders who describe, they describe why insects are  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:41):**  attracted to certain plants and not to others.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:44):**  Why they only feed on some plants and not others and how you can manage nutrition differently  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:49):**  to change that situation to actually produce insect resistance.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:53):**  They describe how you can produce disease suppressive soils so that you don't have any  
**[0:42:57-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:57):**  soil-borne pathogens.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:42:59):**  So the focus of the podcast and also of the book Quality Agriculture is really on the  
**[0:43:07-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:07):**  agronomy, the science and the principles of how do you develop regenerative agriculture  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:14):**  systems that are incredibly resilient and accomplish all the goals that we've spoken  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:19):**  about.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:20):**  How do we actually put that into practice?  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:22):**  So I've been very blessed and absolutely delighted with the information that they have shared  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:26):**  and many farmers have told me that this is their favorite and most valuable podcast that  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:32):**  they've ever listened to and I don't take credit for that as for me being the host.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:37):**  I believe it's simply the people who have been willing to share their wonderful knowledge.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:43):**  Yeah, I definitely echo that.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:45):**  That's been my experience with speaking to so many people in this sector as well and  
**[0:43:49-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:49):**  while this is part of a series focusing on regenerative agriculture, it's definitely  
**[0:43:55-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:43:55):**  the aggregate of so many great voices sharing their knowledge that adds value to this.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:03):**  This is exactly why I asked these questions about the themes and the commonalities that  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:09):**  you started to pick out from doing so many of these interviews because it's something  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:12):**  that I'm always musing over for myself.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:15):**  When you can see the trends, when you can see some of the averages from all of this  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:22):**  information, you can start to pick out these common truths that there's always going to  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:28):**  be different applications and contexts and stuff when it comes to the specific site or  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:31):**  the specific application that someone is working with, but there are patterns that can be sussed  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:37):**  out from this that can apply to a lot more.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:42):**  Speaking of that, what are some of the characteristics that perhaps you've observed that successful  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:47):**  ecological farmers share?  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:50):**  I'd like to go back to your previous question and expand on that one a little bit more as  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:53):**  well and then on successful farmers.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:44:55):**  So the one theme that has emerged from all the people that I've interviewed, which have  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:00):**  been scientists and consultants and growers, farmers, commercial farmers as well, there  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:06):**  is incredible hope and optimism.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:09):**  They all believe that it is possible to and are doing it.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:14):**  They don't just believe this to be a hypothetical future, but something that is present and  
**[0:45:18-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:18):**  existing in reality right now at this moment that regenerative agriculture can feed the  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:27):**  global population a healthy diet of high quality food without fertilizer applications and without  
**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:33):**  toxins.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:35):**  That is an almost universal consensus among the people that I've interviewed.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:39):**  That's now approaching a group of 80 of some of the top growers and scientists in the space  
**[0:45:44-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:44):**  here in North America.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:46):**  Not just in North America, but particularly focused here.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:49):**  So that is incredibly positive and hopeful and uplifting.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:55):**  I'm very excited to have seen that theme emerge.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:45:59):**  To answer your more recent question about the themes of what defines really successful  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:46:10):**  farm operations, who are successful in making this transition, we've put together a webinar  
**[0:46:16-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:46:16):**  and also a podcast where we've identified a set of characteristics, skills and personality  
**[0:46:23-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:46:23):**  characteristics that define the most successful growers who consistently just ace it.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:46:31):**  Their farms perform extremely well.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:46:33):**  If there was one point that I had to pick out, it would be that they focus on deeply  
**[0:46:40-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:46:40):**  understanding the crop quality characteristics that determine their crop's profitability.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:46:49):**  So what I mean by that, an example of that would be on wheat production for example,  
**[0:46:58-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:46:58):**  the characteristics that determine profitability are obviously yield, but then secondly also  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:05):**  protein content as well as protein quality.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:09):**  So then we think about what exactly defines yield.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:13):**  What produces a yield per acre or per hectare basis?  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:17):**  And then we start thinking about the number of grains per seed head, the number of tillers  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:22):**  that a plant produces.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:24):**  And so the most successful growers will identify three or four critical characteristics.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:32):**  In the case of wheat they might identify tillering capacity, they might identify the number of  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:38):**  grains per head and protein content.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:42):**  And they will seek to deeply understand what are the factors that influence those characteristics,  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:51):**  nutritional factors, biological factors, weather conditions and so forth.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:55):**  And they will manage those as closely and carefully as they can.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:47:59):**  And what I've really observed to be intriguing is that they refused to delegate this knowledge  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:05):**  to someone else, not to a consultant or an advisor or an agronomist, but they want to  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:10):**  personally know and understand.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:13):**  So they may delegate bookkeeping, they may delegate product applications and so forth,  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:19):**  but this piece they do not delegate.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:21):**  Yeah, I can see that and that actually does seem to be consistent with some of the observations  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:28):**  I've made of the people that I've looked up to in a lot of these types of industries in  
**[0:48:33-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:33):**  which a very keen understanding of the complexity of living systems is very important to success  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:40):**  in whatever it is they're trying to achieve.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:42):**  Is that just the constant observation and the joy of understanding these things at a  
**[0:48:49-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:49):**  very intimate level, even if there's not a lot of other people around to either share  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:55):**  in the enthusiasm or the delight of that information.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:48:59):**  And it comes from inside and it really drives those people to continue to observe and learn  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:49:04):**  more.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:49:05):**  It's something that it really seems to bridge across various industries as well.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:49:12):**  You're absolutely correct.

**[0:52:39-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:52:39):**  Then to your question of what can people do at home, I'm not familiar with who all of

**[0:52:51-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:52:51):**  First, definitely connect with your food supply and start buying food from producers who are  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:53:04):**  actually seeking to make a difference in the world.

**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/can-we-make-ecological-agriculture-mainstream-by-2040-with-john-kempf-author-of-quality-agriculture/#t=0:53:14):**  The second, I think the most important piece of advice that I would have for people is

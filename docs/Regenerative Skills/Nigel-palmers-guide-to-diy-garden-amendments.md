### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 24 Dec 2021 06:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:15):**  As this year comes to a close, many of us are looking into planning the one to come.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:20):**  Maybe you're setting New Year's resolutions, making plans and goals, maybe you're feeling  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:23):**  optimistic or pessimistic, but if you've been following this show for any length of  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:28):**  time, you're like me, in believing that we can only control ourselves and our own actions.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:33):**  Regardless of what 2022 brings and whatever surprises are coming our way, I'm dedicated  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:37):**  to taking the little steps every day to regenerate my little part of the world and to be a force  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:42):**  for regeneration in whatever small way that I can.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:45):**  And while I believe that all of us as individuals have a lot more power than we often give ourselves  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:50):**  credit for, I also know from experience that our real power lies in collaboration and community.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:00:56):**  And that's why my friends Coon, host of the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture podcast,  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:00):**  and Dimitri, host of the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast, have come together to host a community  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:05):**  call for each of our networks to start 2022 off as the Year of Regeneration.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:12):**  Join the three of us in an open Q&A where we'll be talking about our own projects  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:16):**  and what we're most excited for and inspired by in the year to come.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:20):**  We'll have opportunities to connect with others in the network and the chance to share  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:24):**  your own projects and goals.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:26):**  So join us live at 7pm Central European Time on Monday, January 10th in this connection  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:32):**  of communities and let's get this year of regeneration started together.

**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:52):**  Hello everyone and a very merry Christmas Eve for those of you who celebrate it.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:01:56):**  I sincerely hope that you're sharing this day with the people closest to you, whether  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:00):**  or not you can be with them physically.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:02):**  I myself am far separated from my immediate family, but I'm so grateful to be spending  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:06):**  this time with my partner and her family, who for the time being, live just up the road  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:11):**  from us.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:12):**  Now let's get to today's episode.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:14):**  Now we all know that the topic of fertilizers and inputs for farming is a contentious one.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:19):**  Most of the chemical options out there either use mined minerals or petroleum products through  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:23):**  destructive industrial processes that may improve yields, but commonly pollute waterways,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:29):**  destroy soil life, and are extremely expensive.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:32):**  But what's the alternative?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:34):**  If you have degraded or poor soil where little will grow, you have to improve it somehow,  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:38):**  right?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:39):**  But wouldn't it be amazing if you could make your own fertilizers and soil amendments that  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:43):**  didn't contaminate the ground, but rather enhance biological activity?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:48):**  Luckily, Nigel Palmer, lifelong gardener and author of The Regenerative Grower's Guide  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:53):**  to Garden Amendments, has been researching and developing just these types of solutions  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:57):**  for decades.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:02:58):**  Not only has he been able to dramatically improve the health and the composition of  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:02):**  his soil over time, he's been able to make his amendments easily and cheaply at home  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:06):**  by harnessing the power of weeds and household products to create extracts, ferments, and  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:11):**  inoculants.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:12):**  The result of this has been delicious and nutrient-dense food that you simply can't  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:16):**  buy.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:17):**  Now in this interview from an earlier Skill Exchange call with the farmers on the Climate  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:21):**  Farmers Network here in Europe, Nigel and I spoke about some of the most important steps  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:25):**  and knowledge in creating your own amendments.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:28):**  Nigel first talks about how to assess the health of your plants to know which amendments  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:32):**  to consider, and from there we look into a few different homemade products, how they  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:37):**  work, and when to use them.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:39):**  We also explore how plants take up nutrients in different forms, and how to intervene when  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:43):**  they need it the most, as well as a lot of other useful advice and tactics that any gardener  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:48):**  can use to care for their plants regardless of the context that they're in or the challenges  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:52):**  that they face.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:54):**  Now if you want to hear the full, unedited interview from the Skill Exchange call with  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:03:57):**  the Q&A session at the end, as well as access the resource packet which includes amendment  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:02):**  recipes from the book, just check out the subscription options on our Patreon page.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:07):**  Now this is really empowering information because the recipes are very approachable  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:11):**  and have the power to help break any addiction to chemical fertilizers as you would build  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:15):**  towards healthy, resilient soil.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:18):**  So now I'll hand things over to Nigel.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:22):**  Nigel why don't you tell us how things are going and where you're speaking to us from.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:27):**  Okay, so I'm in the United States, I'm in Connecticut in the United States and that  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:31):**  is in southern New England.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:33):**  For those of you who are city oriented, that's about halfway between Boston and New York.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:41):**  If you drew a line between Boston and New York and went up just a little bit, that's  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:46):**  pretty close to where I am.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:48):**  I am at about a thousand feet elevation, which is relatively high for this part of the world.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:54):**  I'm just out of the Connecticut River Valley which divides Connecticut in half and goes  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:04:59):**  from Long Island Sound all the way up to the Canadian border, dividing Vermont and New  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:05):**  Hampshire and splitting Massachusetts in half.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:10):**  And so today, Nigel, we're going to focus on some of the content from your book, The  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:16):**  Regenerative Growers Guide to Garden Amendments.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:19):**  This is long bolstered, the garden savvy by mimicking and deconstructing the cherishing  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:24):**  and the complex nature of garden amendments and all of the things that you can make for  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:30):**  yourself.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:33):**  You've been the head of curriculum development for the Sustainable Regenerative Garden Program,  
**[0:05:37-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:37):**  if I got that right, and you're also a lifelong commitment to sustainable practices have combined  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:45):**  with your acclaimed professional expertise, which has allowed for practical yet sweeping  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:48):**  knowledge of this field.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:51):**  And so let me start by asking a kind of a large question that we can explore from different  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:05:56):**  angles.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:00):**  How do you know which amendments to use in your garden, assuming that you're going to  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:03):**  have to assess your plant and your soil health somehow, what indicators do you look for that  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:09):**  an amendment may be necessary?  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:12):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:13):**  Good place to start.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:14):**  First of all, most of us have soils that are pretty poor, less than optimal in the mineral  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:23):**  distributions as well as the biological distributions.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:26):**  And biology is something that people are only just starting to think about relative to the  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:30):**  soil, unless you have a really nice thick humus layer, you have plenty of clay for the  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:37):**  exchange capacity of the soil to hold on to those minerals.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:42):**  And you have nice air to flow through and water to be held on to by those small pores  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:48):**  within the soil, then you probably don't have a thriving biological community with which  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:53):**  to interface with the plant.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:06:55):**  Of course, the soil is the plant's digestive system, and unless you have this healthy soil,  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:01):**  we'll call it high tilt, high exchange capacity, then you probably don't have the wherewithal  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:07):**  for that biology to thrive.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:09):**  So there's the whole biological conversation that we could have.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:13):**  And then relative to minerals themselves, the best thing to do to understand the minerals  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:18):**  in your soil is to do a comprehensive soil test.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:21):**  And that'll give you an idea of deficiencies and as well as too much excesses.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:27):**  Many soils have excesses, specifically if they've been farmed or gardened over a long  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:32):**  period of time using practices, NPK kind of practices, probably you got too much potassium  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:39):**  in your soil, for instance.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:40):**  So the first place to start is to try and understand where you're at.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:44):**  It's kind of like shooting an arrow at a target.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:48):**  You need a target.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:49):**  You need a bull's eye somewhere in the world.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:51):**  And so a soil test is a good place to start with that.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:07:55):**  Once you have a soil test, then you can start talking about the macro and micro minerals  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:00):**  that you need and sourcing those things as you go along.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:04):**  No matter what, probably, as I said before, your biological content is lacking.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:10):**  And so working on housing for the bacteria, fungus and archaea, as well as the flow of  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:18):**  air and water in the soil becomes high points.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:21):**  So those are the beginning places of any kind of conversation.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:26):**  Now there's a lot of ways that we can observe where our ecosystem is at.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:30):**  You mentioned those soil tests, but there's a lot of different soil tests out there.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:35):**  Do you recommend one in particular?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:37):**  Because there are ones that you can do yourself at home and others that you have to send away  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:40):**  for a lab to receive.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:44):**  So there, you're right, there's a whole bunch of soil tests.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:47):**  And many of the soil tests essentially are using different strengths of acid to dissolve  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:52):**  the minerals in order to get an idea of what's in them.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:08:56):**  A Melek 3 test is a relatively weak acid that's pretty close to the same sort of acidity that  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:02):**  plants exude when they release compounds into the soil to feed the soil biology.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:08):**  So Melek 3 is a good idea, a good test, and there are labs around that can do that.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:15):**  I have one here in the United States and they actually work internationally as well if anybody  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:19):**  was interested in that kind of conversation.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:23):**  Haney test is a relatively new test that people might want to think about.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:27):**  It's a little bit more effort involved, but it will give you another level of understanding  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:33):**  of what's in the soil relative to minerals.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:38):**  A lot of tests out there will give you information about NPK and a few minerals, but you want  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:44):**  to make sure you get a soil test that covers 15, 16 of the key minerals that are needed  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:50):**  in the soil.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:51):**  So you really get at least an understanding of where you're at relative to those macro  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:55):**  and micro minerals that are in the soil.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:09:59):**  And there's a lot that you can tell from observing the plants as well, from deficiencies to illnesses  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:04):**  to even infections from fungal and bacteria sources.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:08):**  Can you tell us a little bit about the observations that you go through to see about the health  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:12):**  of the plants that might indicate what's actually going on underground?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:16):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:17):**  I think the most important thing is to observe the weeds that grow in your soil.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:23):**  I think it's well worth letting weeds do their thing for many, many reasons.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:28):**  Most importantly, weeds will give you an idea of the mineral deficiencies in your soil.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:34):**  There are, there's a couple of books out there that I really like that give extensive information  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:39):**  about the types of soil that different weeds grow in.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:44):**  Also there are other farmers that will tell you about mineral deficiencies based on the  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:49):**  color of the flowers that grow in your fields.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:52):**  So yes, there's a lot of observations you can make relative to what's growing in your  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:56):**  garden based on the weeds that grow there.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:10:58):**  And also what you'll find is once you start mineralizing your soil and moving your soil  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:02):**  in a direction of balance, you're going to find that the weeds that grow in your soil  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:07):**  are going to change, which is a really fascinating thing.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:10):**  And it's one of the first indications of, hey, guess what?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:12):**  This is really working and there's something to all of this.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:15):**  The other thing that's interesting to look at, and you talked about plants and how they  
**[0:11:20-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:20):**  look, when you have plants that are succumb to insects and pathogens, airborne pathogens  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:30):**  and things like that, that's a good indication that the Brix level of your plants is very  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:35):**  low.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:36):**  In fact, you can determine or guess educationally the Brix level of plants by the insects that  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:43):**  are actually eating your plant.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:45):**  As you may or may not know, insects do not have the enzymes in their gut to digest plants  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:52):**  that have high sugar content.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:54):**  This is why using a refractometer and bricsing your plant has a lot of value to it.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:11:59):**  But also when you see specific insects eating your plants, they will tell you a range of  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:06):**  Brix that your plants in.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:08):**  If you're being affected by aphids and some of these little tiny guys that eat things,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:14):**  the plants are probably in the range of seven, eight kind of thing.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:18):**  If you're observing grasshoppers and things that are munching on your plant, your Brix  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:23):**  is, those plants are probably in the range of maybe 10 and 11, 12 kind of range.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:29):**  And so you can see your plant health improving by the insects that are actually chowing them  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:37):**  down as you improve the quality and health of the plants that you're growing in the field.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:42):**  So by watching weeds, understanding the weeds that grow there, and also the insects that  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:47):**  are actually infecting your plants, you can tell what's going on relative to their Brix  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:53):**  sugar content and health.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:55):**  Same with powdery mildews.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:12:56):**  If you're getting mildews and airborne pathogens on your plants, that's a good indication that  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:01):**  they're pretty unhealthy.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:02):**  A healthy plant will use the excess lipids that it makes to put that nice thick layer  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:08):**  of fat or lipids on the leaf surface.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:12):**  Perhaps you all see those really healthy plants.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:14):**  They have that nice shiny green layer on it.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:17):**  Those are lipids.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:18):**  And that means the plant has enough energy to actually produce those lipids and put that  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:22):**  layer on the plant leaf.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:24):**  And there's an indication that you have a healthy plant that is going to be able to  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:28):**  protect itself against some of the airborne pathogens that are out there.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:32):**  So yeah, hanging out with your plant is a really good idea.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:37):**  Nothing fertilizes the garden like the gardener's shadow, right?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:40):**  Yep, foot in the garden, right?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:42):**  Most important thing to put in the garden.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:43):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:44):**  There's no doubt about it.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:45):**  All right.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:46):**  So we've got a good baseline understanding of the indicators that could give us an idea  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:50):**  of where we're at health wise, both in the soil and in our plants.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:55):**  Give me a little introduction as to why you would bring in amendments, what they're capable  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:13:59):**  of doing, and then we can go into some of our recipes.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:02):**  Okay, sure.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:03):**  So as I suggested, once you do a soil test, you're going to find that your soil probably  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:08):**  doesn't have all the things that it needs.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:11):**  And most people are looking in their plants and seeing insect infestation and airborne  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:16):**  pathogens.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:17):**  They know they got to do something.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:18):**  So the reason to do and use amendments is very clear.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:23):**  If you don't have a healthy plant that's brixting in the 12, 13, 14 or higher range, it's a  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:29):**  good indication that you have to do something about it if you want to have a healthy plant  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:32):**  that's not going to get eaten by insects, for instance.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:35):**  And so the next thing is, well, what do I do?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:40):**  Why use these amendments and what's in them, if you will?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:44):**  And it was not long after I started making all of these amendments and applying them  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:49):**  in the garden and recognizing there was improvements, I've decided to determine what's in them,  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:56):**  right?  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:14:57):**  What is actually in these amendments and are they representing the 16 or 18, you pick a  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:03):**  number of elements that need to be fed to a plant.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:09):**  And the other thing is I was really taken back when I first did my soil tests and I  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:12):**  realized that I need one part per million molybdenum.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:15):**  Well, where am I going to find molybdenum and how am I going to put one part per million  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:19):**  in my field or in my garden?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:22):**  It was a daunting task for me, nevermind cobalt or manganese, zinc, copper, it goes on and  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:29):**  on and on.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:30):**  And so I started doing analysis on the mineral amendments that I was making and I found that  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:37):**  all the minerals were there.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:40):**  And one of the reasons I published this book is to make this information available to people.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:44):**  And there's an appendix in the back of the book that actually lists the elemental composition  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:50):**  of many of the amendments that are actually the recipes are given in the book.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:15:56):**  And I've also started a website to try and make this expand this database and make it  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:00):**  available to people, not only all over the world, but from all over the world.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:05):**  So people, no matter where you live, can recognize this is how I can get these amendment minerals.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:11):**  The other thing that's really cool about making a minerals, making mineral amendments from  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:15):**  plants and other things that are organic or living is that these amendments are available  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:23):**  to the plant.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:24):**  They're in the ionic forms, the liquid water-based ionic forms that plants can use directly.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:30):**  And so rather than putting something in the soil and waiting for it to decompose and be  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:35):**  digested by the soil solution, by the soil ecology into the soil solution and absorbed  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:40):**  through the xylem pathway, you can apply these as foliar sprays directly onto the leaf and  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:46):**  the plant can access them and flow them through the plant through the phloem pathway.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:51):**  And so the reason you'd need to do it is because most of us don't grow really healthy plants.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:16:57):**  And the rationale behind using these specific amendments is that they are in plant available  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:04):**  forms and they're in the proportions that plants needs.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:07):**  When you look at the data, you're going to see that the molybdenum is 0.14 part per million  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:14):**  for stinging nettle, for instance.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:16):**  Wow.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:17):**  I rang the bell.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:18):**  Not only do I know where to get it, but it's in the proportion that the plant needs ready  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:21):**  to go.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:22):**  Yeah, that's fantastic.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:23):**  And that was one of the things that really opened my eyes about reading the book is that  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:26):**  all of the things that we need are not hidden somewhere or needing to be mined out of the  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:31):**  soil.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:32):**  They exist in our environment.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:33):**  Often times in the plants that we're most trying to get rid of and keep under control.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:38):**  Why not use that as an asset to keep the ones that we're trying to make flourish even healthier?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:46):**  And so, okay, there's a whole range of different amendments in this book.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:50):**  Can you break them down into different categories and the functions that they have in the garden?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:55):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:17:57):**  So the top level category is biological and mineral, right?  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:02):**  There are, and I've tried to arrange it so that here's the biological amendments.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:07):**  Here are the mineral amendments.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:09):**  And then there's a few in there that are both.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:11):**  When we start talking IMO4 and making compost piles, for instance, now we're moving into  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:17):**  the realm of both biological and mineral.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:19):**  So 35,000 feet, that's the first breakdown.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:23):**  The next breakdown is whether or not they're shelf stable or not.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:29):**  I think it's, at least in my part of the world, we go through winter and it gets really cold,  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:33):**  everything freezes and we get to skate on ponds and ski and snow and all that kind of  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:38):**  lovely stuff.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:39):**  Well, it's nice to be able to make these things in the fall or the spring or the summer and  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:43):**  have them shelf stable on a shelf in wherever you keep them.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:48):**  So that when spring rolls around, you're ready to go.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:51):**  Not only that, you can actually apply some of these things as foliar sprays in the wintertime  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:18:56):**  that will be absorbed through the bark of the tree and serve to provide nutrients for  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:02):**  the plant in the wintertime.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:04):**  So the next level is shelf stable or not shelf stable.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:08):**  And then finally, one of the things about the data that I provide in the appendix is  
**[0:19:14-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:14):**  that it shows you the degree to which each process has the ability to remove minerals  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:22):**  or elements into solution.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:24):**  For instance, I started taking weeds and throw them in a bucket of water and just do nothing  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:29):**  and waiting a couple of weeks until it stunk so bad that I got complaints from the people  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:34):**  that live in my house with me and I had to apply them to my plant readily.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:39):**  And then you move into the fermented, fermenting the weeds with leaf mold biology.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:47):**  Okay.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:48):**  Now you move into fermented plant juices where you're actually using sugar to ferment these  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:53):**  things.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:54):**  And each of these techniques work, but each of these techniques remove out a different,  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:19:59):**  I'll call it quantity or concentration of these constituents for any particular plant  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:05):**  that you're or process that you're going to use.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:07):**  And so the next third level is the efficacy of removing minerals for use in the garden.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:14):**  And I talk about minerals and removing minerals, but in fact, these processes are moving, are  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:19):**  removing far more than minerals.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:20):**  They're moving, removing complex compounds, enzymes, and many other things that are helpful  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:28):**  to the plant.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:29):**  So 35,000 feet, you've got mineral and biological amendments.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:33):**  You've got shelf stable and not shelf stable.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:35):**  And then you've got the degree of efficacy of each of these processes to provide those  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:41):**  sorts of things.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:43):**  So let's move now into application.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:47):**  Here we'll go into more specific examples and case studies between plants and different  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:51):**  amendments, but for now let's speak broadly about how these are applied.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:20:55):**  You talked about foliar sprays, there's applications directly into your compost or into your soil  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:00):**  and how these work at different phases or life cycles of your plants.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:06):**  Because of course they're going to need different things as they go through these different  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:10):**  stages, vegetative, flowering, fruiting, or dormant and different plants have different  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:16):**  ones of those at different times of the year.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:18):**  And so how important is it to pay attention to the phase of life that your plants are  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:23):**  in and intervene at the right moment with the things that it really needs?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:27):**  Yeah, well, I know throughout my life, I have really found it important to understand the  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:34):**  phase of life that I'm in and what I need.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:36):**  Why wouldn't it be the same for a plant?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:40):**  So phases of plant needs and intervention.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:45):**  So as you suggested, plants go through phases and for each phase they go through, they have  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:52):**  different needs.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:21:53):**  And at germination, for instance, they need everything they can get kind of thing.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:01):**  Well so at germination, let's say that we're talking tomatoes.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:07):**  If I am going to germinate tomatoes and I just got that noodle going and that tomato  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:13):**  plant is just starting off, what might I put on that to facilitate the growth of that tomato  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:19):**  plant?  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:20):**  Well, it doesn't take long to recognize that a fermented plant juice made from the tomatoes  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:26):**  of last year is going to have everything that a tomato needs and wants.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:32):**  And so I quickly realized that by providing fermented plant juice of a tomato to my germinating  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:40):**  tomatoes, I can't think of a better diverse product.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:47):**  Again all the minerals it needs, again in forms that the plant can use that that tomato  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:52):**  plant might want.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:53):**  And I'm going to apply that as a drench while it's a seedling.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:22:57):**  But once it gets several leaves on it, now I can start applying it as a foliar spray  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:02):**  as well.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:03):**  So there's a plant specific thing.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:05):**  Now I'm going to change subjects and talk about that whole mineral and that soil test  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:09):**  again.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:10):**  So when I've done that soil test and I recognize the macro and micro minerals that the plant  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:15):**  might need, I will consider the long and short term aspects of developing the minerals in  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:23):**  that soil.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:24):**  So when we talk about calcium, for instance, we want a really high percentage of calcium  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:27):**  in our soils.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:28):**  If you read some of the books out there, you're going to see 68% for instance, right, as a  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:35):**  percentage of calcium.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:37):**  Well when you go do your soil test and you find you got 30%, all of a sudden you really  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:41):**  need a boatload of calcium.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:42):**  So how are you going to do that?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:43):**  Well that's where rock dust come into play.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:45):**  So rock dust will help with the macro minerals, whether it's magnesium, sulfur, calcium, whatever  
**[0:23:52-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:52):**  it might need, and finding a local quarry where you get that really, really fine float.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:23:59):**  That's the kind of stuff that you want to be applying.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:01):**  And you want to do that in the wintertime, like now here in New England, and you want  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:05):**  to do it several times throughout the fall, winter, spring to distribute that rock dust  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:11):**  and allow the winter weather and the water to break that down into the soil solution.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:18):**  So now we talk about the trace minerals like the molybdenum, cobalt, manganese, and things  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:25):**  like that.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:26):**  So you can apply those as foliar sprays with the mineral amendments that we just talked  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:31):**  about, the fermented plant juices and the vinegar extractions that we're talking about.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:35):**  So then we get into the general idea of, okay, now I've got my garden farm up and running  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:42):**  and things are mature.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:44):**  You want to give them more of a nitrogen-based product throughout the growth period.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:52):**  And I found the leaf mold fermentations of weeds provides a really high nitrogen source,  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:24:59):**  as well as the fermented plant juices and fermented fish and things like that.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:02):**  That has a really high nitrogen.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:03):**  So that would be a good time then.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:05):**  And then when we get into flowering, we need a phosphorus source.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:08):**  And so for phosphorus, the vinegar extracted bones offer a tremendous degree of phosphorus  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:14):**  in it.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:15):**  And so foliar spraying with something like that during flowering is a great idea.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:19):**  And then of course at fruiting, now we're back to calcium and we want to get calcium  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:23):**  into that plant.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:25):**  And so I'd recommend something like vinegar extracted bones, which have really high phosphorus  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:31):**  content in it.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:32):**  And again, if you look at the data that I've put, you can see that things have these things.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:37):**  That oyster shells have significantly higher calcium content than many of the other ferments,  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:45):**  while fermented bones of mammals, cows, pigs are going to have a very high phosphorus content.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:52):**  And of course they all still have a compliment of the broad spectrum minerals that the plant  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:57):**  needs.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:25:58):**  So it's not like you're just putting just phosphorus or just calcium in there.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:00):**  You're still giving broad spectrum mineral amendments to these plants as they go forward.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:04):**  Yeah, that's one of the remarkable things about these recipes and using the plants that  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:09):**  are around you is that it's not using these sort of isolates and just a few compounds  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:16):**  that may be difficult for a plant to absorb because of deficiencies of other support minerals  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:21):**  that actually help it to make use of the macro that we're trying to deliver.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:26):**  It's kind of the same concept as eating whole foods rather than isolated supplements for  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:31):**  us as humans, right?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:33):**  Yes.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:34):**  There's a great parallel between what we're talking about here and our own self.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:39):**  When you consider the human gut, it's loaded with bacteria and all sorts of living things.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:46):**  Well, so is the soil.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:47):**  So the soil is a digestive system for the plant is akin to the gut as a digestive system  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:53):**  for us.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:54):**  And when you start thinking about it, the key is to have a really thriving soil because  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:26:59):**  the soil is what the plant needs and we're what the, where we eat the plants.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:04):**  So it's really all about the soil and making sure that soil is that very robust digestive  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:09):**  system for the plant.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:12):**  So we've been talking about some specific applications right now and the necessary nuance  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:18):**  of the phase of life of the plant, tailoring this to the efficiencies or the surpluses  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:24):**  in your own soil.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:26):**  Are there any of these amendments that are just generally good and you can't really go  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:32):**  wrong by applying them?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:35):**  Yes.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:37):**  My two favorite are, at least from the data that I've gained so far, are dandelion and  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:42):**  stinging metal.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:43):**  They seem to be very, very high in a broad spectrum of many minerals.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:48):**  So those are the two go-to generals for me.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:51):**  I think that plants in general, each of them are unique in their own way.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:27:57):**  And so the nuances of what they want, need, what's best, what's general is really up to  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:02):**  us as experimental gardeners to find out ourselves.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:06):**  Again, this is one of the reasons that I put this information out there.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:08):**  It took me an awful long time to gather this information and do the analysis and gather  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:15):**  the data to show what was going on.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:17):**  And I felt it was just so important that this information be available to people all over  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:21):**  the world so that we can all work together and expand this line of thinking in this line  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:27):**  of gardening.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:29):**  It bewilders me why it's so difficult to find this information, but in fact, it's up to  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:34):**  all of us to learn about these things and experiment.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:38):**  And I mentioned the refractometer earlier.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:41):**  The refractometer is a really good way to determine whether or not a plant likes what  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:46):**  you're applying to it.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:48):**  As we suggested, when you apply a foliar spray, you should be getting results in hours from  
**[0:28:52-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:52):**  that application.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:54):**  And let's just say you had a hedgerow of blueberries.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:28:59):**  You could apply, you'd measure the refractive index of the two different portions of those  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:05):**  blueberries, apply the foliar spray to one of them, and then go back and measure the  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:10):**  refractive index an hour later, two hours later, the next day.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:14):**  And what you'll see if the plant likes what you're providing is you're going to see an  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:18):**  increase in the refractive index.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:19):**  And so what you're doing is you are feeding the plant and getting it used to the ideas  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:24):**  of providing it this nutrition.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:26):**  And the plant becomes familiar and expecting these things.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:29):**  And so in order to help increase the health over time, providing these things on a regular  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:33):**  basis will improve the general health of that plant going forward.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:39):**  And you can measure it with a refractometer, which is a really great idea.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:42):**  Again, it's another empowering concept that we can all use for pretty cheap to evaluate  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:49):**  what we're doing.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:50):**  I also really like what you said earlier about this needs to continue to advance and people  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:29:57):**  need to take up the responsibility of continuing the experiments and the learning to figure  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:04):**  out what works in their conditions.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:07):**  Tell us from your experience, how you've gone about designing these experiments, gathering  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:11):**  information and getting to a point where you feel confident that this will really work  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:16):**  for others.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:18):**  Well, I kind of told you that I'll try and lay it out again.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:21):**  The first was doing it and seeing results and then actually deciding to measure what  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:26):**  was in the amendments.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:28):**  And I worked with several different labs to try and do this analysis to get a standard  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:34):**  lab that will do the analysis for me on a regular basis.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:39):**  One of the veins of any kind of research, specifically scientific research is sources  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:46):**  of variation.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:48):**  And so by having a single lab with the same process over and over and over again eliminates  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:54):**  a lot of sources of variation.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:30:56):**  And so as I suggested, I published a lot of it in here and on my website I have a database  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:02):**  that I'm putting out there for the public and I'm inviting people from all over the  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:06):**  world to participate in this experiment to increase this database.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:10):**  So I was talking to a farmer in Pakistan not too long ago and I was telling him about,  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:17):**  yeah, just go get some dandelions and as a start, right?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:20):**  And he said, well, there aren't any dandelions around here.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:22):**  And I said, well, what do you have?  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:23):**  And he said, I don't know.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:25):**  And so I said, that was really one of the light bulb moments for me that said, oh, well,  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:29):**  find out what you do have, go through the process, send the amendment into someplace.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:35):**  And so now you know, and then we'll publish that and it's available for anybody in Pakistan  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:39):**  or anybody in the world.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:40):**  So they can start building on these understandings as well and using them and knowing what's  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:44):**  in these things.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:45):**  So that's the first place for me was actually to try and figure out, well, what's really  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:50):**  in this and why is it working?  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:52):**  And does it make sense that these things are actually nurturing a plant?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:31:56):**  And so that was a really fun moment.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:00):**  And I remember when I first got some of the first data back and saw just what broad spectrum  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:04):**  minerals were in some of these things.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:06):**  It was a real mind blowing thing for me.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:09):**  I really...  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:10):**  Yeah, isn't it fantastic now that we can kind of crowdsource this information, the internet  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:14):**  gives us access to other people's findings from across the globe and we can all learn  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:19):**  together.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:21):**  I'm wondering too, if you see a lot of business potential in creating some of these amendments  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:27):**  of making them at home and making them available to people in your area.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:31):**  Yeah, I thought about that.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:34):**  But the first thing is I don't want to make any money on it.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:38):**  And I think that if I do that enterprise, then it stifles the learning of others.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:47):**  Making these things is really simple.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:49):**  Most people get in their car, they drive to the store, they purchase something and they  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:53):**  come back and they have no idea what's in the bag or the bottle and they apply it anyway.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:32:57):**  Well, you can actually make this stuff in the time it takes you to go to the store and  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:01):**  come back.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:02):**  I mean, the 20 minutes or the 15 minutes, you can actually make a jar of fermented plants  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:05):**  use or a vinegar extraction really easy.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:08):**  So my thesis is more of empowering people to do it themselves and know how simple it  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:13):**  is rather than to try and make a bunch of it and sell it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:18):**  I mean, first of all, I don't have the energy for that.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:20):**  I'm old and I'm done with all that kind of crazy stuff.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:23):**  Maybe you guys are young enough and are interested in doing that, but for me, it's the information  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:28):**  that's so important.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:30):**  All right, thanks once again to Nigel Palmer.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:35):**  You can find more about Nigel's book, The Regenerative Grower's Guide to Garden Amendments  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:40):**  at ChelseaGreen.com.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:41):**  I also highly recommend checking out the catalog of other titles on gardening and regenerative  
**[0:33:46-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:46):**  agriculture while you're there.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:48):**  Now, before you go, remember that these episodes are only the beginning of the ongoing conversations  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:52):**  happening around these topics on the Regenerative Skills Discord server.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:33:56):**  Over the next couple of weeks, we'll be exploring questions there like, what challenges keep  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:01):**  coming up in your own gardens that are likely connected to the health of the life in your  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:05):**  soil?  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:06):**  How can you tell if the amendment or nutrition plan that you currently have is effective  
**[0:34:11-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:11):**  or not?  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:12):**  And what weeds or persistent annuals around you might be untapped gold mines of minerals  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:17):**  and plant nutrition?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:18):**  Now, as I personally learn more about the deeper and emerging science of soil and plant  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:24):**  nutrition, they all seem to lead back to some simple and recurring patterns.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:28):**  It's not the mineral makeup of the soil that feeds the plants.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:32):**  It's the microbiology and the fungal life that makes these nutrients available.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:36):**  By caring for the microbes and all the life in the soil, we create the conditions for  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:40):**  their symbiotic relationships with the plants that we want to grow.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:44):**  And in turn, we can enjoy that nutrition in the food that we harvest from them.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:47):**  Our own health and well-being is directly related to the health and the resilience of  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:51):**  all the other forms of life in the ecosystems that sustain us.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:34:55):**  So instead of trying to feed plants directly, we need to steward every level of the ecology  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:35:00):**  so that they can all feed themselves.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:35:02):**  Now that's our show for this week.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:35:04):**  As always, don't forget to keep taking those little steps every day towards a regenerative  
**[0:35:08-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nigel-palmers-guide-to-diy-garden-amendments/#t=0:35:08):**  future and I'll be right by your side along the way.

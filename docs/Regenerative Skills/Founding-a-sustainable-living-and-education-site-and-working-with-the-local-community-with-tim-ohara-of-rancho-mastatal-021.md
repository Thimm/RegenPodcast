### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 16:59:33)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to this episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds  
**[0:00:04-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:04):**  of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:08):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier, and I have a fantastic interview for you in this session,  
**[0:00:13-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:13):**  so let's jump right on in.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:24):**  My guest today is Tim O'Hara, who's the owner and founder of Rancho Mastatal Sustainability  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:29):**  and Education Center, one of the premier sustainable living education sites in the world.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:35):**  For more than 15 years, Rancho Mastatal has been leading the way in permaculture, natural  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:40):**  building, and regenerative living skills such as fermentation, biogas digestion, soap making,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:45):**  and much more.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:47):**  Pretty much all the stuff that I am completely in love with.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:50):**  Tim started out with a degree in agricultural economics, and first began working in corporate  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:55):**  agribusiness before becoming disillusioned with that world and joining the Peace Corps,  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:00:59):**  where he worked for two years in Uruguay and there met his wife.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:04):**  After another short stint working in agribusiness, Tim was ready for a big change.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:09):**  Through a friend of his through the Peace Corps, Tim then found the land in Mastatal,  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:12):**  Costa Rica, where the dream of the ranch came together.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:17):**  Now in this interview, Tim shares invaluable insights on how to integrate with your local  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:21):**  community as an outsider, how their demonstration site has had a positive impact on their community  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:27):**  at large, and he goes over some of the biggest hurdles that he and his team have had to overcome  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:33):**  to get where they are today.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:35):**  This is a great episode for anyone who dreams of starting their own training or educational  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:39):**  site one day.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:41):**  So remember to stay tuned at the end of this interview for another weekly tip.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:45):**  In this session I'll be talking about the importance of involving your community in  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:49):**  your projects.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:50):**  Now I'll send it over to Tim.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:52):**  Hey Tim, thanks so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:55):**  How are you?  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:56):**  I'm doing well Oliver, thanks so much for having me on.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:01:59):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:01):**  I've got a ton of stuff that I'd love to ask you, so why don't we just jump right in.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:05):**  Sounds great.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:06):**  Alright, so let's start off by having you tell us a little bit about your personal background.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:12):**  So I grew up in upstate New York, typical suburban upbringing.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:18):**  Went to school in upstate New York as well at Cornell University.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:23):**  I have a degree in agricultural economics.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:26):**  I went straight to work into the corporate world after I graduated.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:30):**  My first job was with Chiquita, a large agribusiness.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:35):**  After getting a bit disheartened with my life there, I escaped to the Peace Corps.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:42):**  Went two years in South America and Uruguay where I met my current wife, Robin Nunes.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:49):**  After I got out of Peace Corps, I went back into the corporate world to go back into the  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:54):**  world of agribusiness.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:02:56):**  Moved to Seattle and lived there for a few years.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:00):**  Doing that, working for a large exporter, fresh fruits and vegetables.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:04):**  Again got disenchanted with that world and started to look for alternatives and other  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:11):**  options for how I could spend my time, energy and resources in a more fulfilling way.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:17):**  While in Seattle, a friend of ours, a friend of mine from the Peace Corps contacted me  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:23):**  and told me about a small community in Costa Rica where he had recently visited.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:29):**  We got chatting.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:30):**  As Peace Corps friends, I had always talked about possibly starting a project together  
**[0:03:35-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:35):**  that related to sustainability organic farming and he convinced Robin and I to jump on to  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:43):**  a plane and come down to Costa Rica to check out the site, which we did.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:47):**  We were looking to transition out of life in urban Seattle and had our sights on rural  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:53):**  Oregon when we came down here.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:03:57):**  After our visit, we started brainstorming and thinking about what life could look like  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:02):**  back in Latin America, a region that we had always been open to returning to based on  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:09):**  our positive experience in the Peace Corps.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:13):**  We decided to put together a business plan and we got the financing together.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:19):**  In 2000, we purchased the property where Rancho Mastotel currently is and moved down to the  
**[0:04:26-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:26):**  small community in late 2001 when we opened our doors and started our life as owners of  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:37):**  the Rancho Mastotel Sustainability Education Center.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:40):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:41):**  You mentioned that it's a sustainability and education center.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:44):**  Can you give me a rundown of what your operations are and what the day-to-day looks like there?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:53):**  Our property measures about 300 acres.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:04:57):**  It's in a small rural community of about 110 people.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:01):**  It's uniquely located smack dab in between the small community downtown, central Mastotel,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:09):**  and one of Costa Rica's newest national parks named La Angrreja.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:16):**  At our campus, we run a host of different programs related to sustainability education.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:24):**  We offer workshops in a variety of topics such as renewable energy, permaculture, growing  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:32):**  food in the tropics, wilderness medicine, natural building, and other topics.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:40):**  We receive high school, college, university, middle school groups who come down and run  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:46):**  through our custom design sustainability education programs.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:50):**  We also have a year-long apprenticeship whereby six apprentices come and live with us on our  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:05:57):**  campus for the better part of a year and learn about the different techniques and practices  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:03):**  that we employ in return.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:06):**  They work with us on our different systems and help us with the day-to-day tasks and  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:12):**  chores at the ranch.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:15):**  Then we run a host of educational programs to high school, college, middle school, and  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:23):**  university groups that come through and participate in our custom design sustainability programs.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:31):**  In addition, we receive standard guest tourists that come through our area that are interested  
**[0:06:37-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:37):**  in what we do and oftentimes interested in getting into the rainforest and enjoying the  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:45):**  nature that's so abundant in and around our small community.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:50):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:51):**  Now, one of the things that I was really curious to ask you about, since I'm also living somewhat  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:06:56):**  of an expat lifestyle in a similar environment here in rural Guatemala, and I know that one  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:02):**  of the big challenges for myself and many other people I know living here is how to  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:07):**  better integrate into these small indigenous communities as a foreigner.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:12):**  How have you been able to do that in both your life and work in the small village in  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:16):**  Costa Rica?  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:18):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:23):**  What makes up a really considerable part of our work here as expats living in a small  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:29):**  rural community, it's imperative that we are welcomed and embraced by the community so  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:36):**  that we can be successful both in our work and in our personal lives here on a daily  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:42):**  basis.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:44):**  My wife and I, as I said earlier, met in the Peace Corps, so we have had that experience  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:48):**  of living rurally in Latin America as expatriates.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:07:53):**  During our Peace Corps time, we were able to learn different techniques that would help  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:02):**  us seamlessly integrate into a community such as this.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:08):**  So mainly, for me, the biggest part of having success in leading a happy life here in rural  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:17):**  Costa Rica is just really immersing myself as much as possible into the day-to-day lives  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:25):**  of people here.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:26):**  We're fortunate to live on the edge of town.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:29):**  We have access to a lot of the local homes and businesses here.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:37):**  One of the first bits for me that was so important in integrating was joining the men's soccer  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:46):**  team.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:47):**  As I'm sure many people know, soccer is everything in Latin America, including here in Costa  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:54):**  Rica.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:08:55):**  I have a history of playing team sports, and so soon after getting here, I started going  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:00):**  down to the soccer field and playing soccer with the kids and with the adults.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:05):**  For me, that was a great way to get to know a lot of the people on a more social level.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:13):**  Above and beyond that, we made a concerted effort upon our arrival to get out and meet  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:18):**  as many people as possible to tell them about our project and to tell them about what our  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:25):**  plans were for the ranch.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:31):**  More recently, we had a daughter, actually nine years ago now.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:36):**  She just turned nine today.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:39):**  She allowed us to bridge the gap in many cases into many of the households that we hadn't  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:46):**  succeeded in getting into up until that point.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:51):**  That was a great development for us getting into some of these households that she allowed  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:09:58):**  us to go into because she was going to school with grandkids or kids.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:04):**  All in all, it's just mainly been an effort in trying to get out there and get integrated  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:10):**  and involved, participating in the local government, participating in community cleanups, and just  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:17):**  demonstrating almost on a weekly basis that we're here for the right reasons and that  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:23):**  the impact that we're trying to create with our business is a positive one.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:28):**  We're constantly conscientious about the potential negative impacts that our business bring and  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:35):**  constantly trying to mitigate the negative and augment the positives.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:42):**  What are some of the negatives that may come with your operations?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:46):**  I think just in general, when you bring people from outside this community into the community,  
**[0:10:54-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:10:54):**  there are potential negative interactions that people that come here have with other  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:03):**  community members.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:04):**  It's hard to always monitor that and or control that.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:11):**  As an example, somebody might come to our facility and stay for a number of weeks and  
**[0:11:18-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:18):**  perhaps spend a little bit too much time at the bar, partying, or getting involved with  
**[0:11:27-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:27):**  someone here locally and leaving a bad imprint on the community and what it means to bring  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:36):**  tourists into a small, I would say, delegate community such as this that up until our arrival  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:43):**  didn't have a lot of experience with foreign tourists coming through.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:50):**  Just in general, I guess any type of development can bring some negative impacts, whether they  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:11:57):**  be environmental or social.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:01):**  When you invite people that you don't know into your community, there is that risk at  
**[0:12:06-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:06):**  times that those people will represent you in a negative way and potentially impact in  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:17):**  some way the social fabric or the environment in ways that you didn't intend to.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:23):**  I like that.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:24):**  Those are some really good insights.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:28):**  I know that the ranch also, like you said, attracts tons of students and participators  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:33):**  from all over the world.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:35):**  But I'm curious what sort of effect have you been able to have on the local community with  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:39):**  your projects?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:41):**  Has your demonstration site inspired any of the locals to mimic any of your operations  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:46):**  or to adopt any of your tactics?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:49):**  Yes, definitely.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:51):**  When we came here 16 years ago, we were the first business, formal business in town.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:12:57):**  It was kind of a backwater then, difficult to get to.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:00):**  The roads were very poor.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:02):**  There were no telephones, no internet.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:05):**  For the most part, the community was experiencing a massive brain drain.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:11):**  When kids became 16, 17, or 18 years old, they would commonly get up and go somewhere  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:18):**  else in search of work, whether that be an urban center or a tourist center because of  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:24):**  the lack of employment in this region.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:28):**  On our arrival, we made a point of only hiring local people as a way to demonstrate that  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:36):**  we were serious about positively impacting the local economy.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:43):**  From our early success, some other young people, young families in the community started to  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:50):**  emulate some of our successful practices.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:13:54):**  If you walk around Nastital today, you'll find a community that's much different than  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:00):**  it was when we got here.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:01):**  Not only are there phones here now, but there are a number of local businesses that have  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:06):**  been started by families here, many of them which have become quite successful.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:13):**  Some of those include the Iguana Chocolatte, which is a local organic chocolate farm.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:19):**  They grow all their own cacao.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:21):**  They process it all.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:22):**  It's from farm to bar.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:25):**  They've had great success with their amazing work just down the road from us.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:31):**  There's also another business in town that's flourishing called Finca Cienpre Verde, started  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:37):**  by a local named Marcos Garcia and his partner Jenny Mora.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:44):**  They started a Spanish school recognizing the demand for Spanish language classes to  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:51):**  some of the people that were coming through the ranch.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:54):**  That operation has since blossomed into a full-scale farm project.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:14:59):**  They have guiding services, offer Spanish classes, and receive guests in their facilities.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:07):**  Another spot up the road called Villas Mastatal, similarly started by locals, emulating a bit  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:15):**  what we do.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:16):**  It's a farm project now that, again, has turned into a successful operation that receives  
**[0:15:23-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:23):**  guests and does some volunteer work with volunteers that come through their doors.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:31):**  Those are just three examples of some of the formal businesses.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:35):**  There are a number of other businesses that I failed to mention as well as a number of  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:41):**  informal businesses that have strung up as a result of the more robust economy and the  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:47):**  increased traffic coming through.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:50):**  For us, a big part of our work was to try to support the local farmers, the local farming  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:15:56):**  community, and get involved with what farming might look like in the future here.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:03):**  One of our big contributions, I think, is just being one of the larger agricultural  
**[0:16:08-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:08):**  consumers here and, as much as we can, buying only ag products that we can source from local  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:18):**  farmers in the region.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:20):**  As a result, a lot of farmers are now able to take their products to our local markets  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:28):**  in an effort, hopefully, to keep farming alive long enough until we can start thinking about  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:35):**  what a shift in that paradigm will look like and what food security could look like for  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:41):**  this region moving forward.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:43):**  Wow.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:44):**  You must have seen some big changes in those communities since you got there and must be  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:48):**  proud of some of the positive influences that you've helped to nurture that.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:53):**  Yeah, it's been a wonderful place to be.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:16:58):**  It's been a great location to see evolve and unfold.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:04):**  It's a beautiful environment with amazing people and, hopefully, an increasingly robust  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:11):**  local economy that will be able to support increasing numbers of kids and young adults  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:16):**  that desire to stay here for the long term.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:21):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:22):**  Now, I want to switch gears for just a second here.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:25):**  Since I've been following your newsletters and promotions for years, I wanted to ask  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:29):**  about a concept that you promote and like to call invisible structures.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:34):**  Can you explain what you mean by that term and how it works within a regenerative ecosystem?  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:41):**  Invisible structures refer to those business structures that visitors or people that come  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:49):**  to your site oftentimes don't see.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:53):**  Those structures include financial structures.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:17:57):**  They include how you organize your community, how you govern yourselves, how you make decisions,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:07):**  and a topic that is becoming increasingly important, I think, for projects and communities  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:13):**  such as ours.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:16):**  These are oftentimes the structures that, at the beginning, organizations pay less attention  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:23):**  to than, say, the building systems or the food production systems or the educational  
**[0:18:29-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:29):**  systems, yet over the course of the long run, probably, are the most important structures  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:36):**  to get right and to have in place if you are to think about longevity and durability as  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:43):**  an entity.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:45):**  A few years ago, really, with the help and urging of one of our core team members named  
**[0:18:52-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:18:52):**  Laura Killingbeck, she really made it a point to urge the ranch to start thinking more about  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:00):**  what these structures are and what they need to look like for us to stay together as a  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:08):**  successful operation into the future.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:12):**  Over the last three years or so, we've put a lot of time and energy into thinking about  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:17):**  our mission, our vision, our objectives, our strategies, how we compensate ourselves, how  
**[0:19:24-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:24):**  we make decisions as an organization, how we invite new members in, how we ask old members  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:32):**  to leave, and how we govern ourselves.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:38):**  Those are all really important pieces that make it possible for a business such as ours  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:49):**  to be around as long as possible.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:51):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:52):**  Can you give me some examples of the main structures, the main invisible structures  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:19:59):**  that have been essential for your operation on Rancho Massatale?  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:04):**  Sure.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:05):**  One example is our governance structure, which hasn't been totally worked out, but that we've  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:11):**  been working on improving over the last few years.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:15):**  We are playing around with an idea called sociocracy, and that provides us a structure  
**[0:20:25-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:25):**  essentially that helps us make decisions in a hopefully just and fair way.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:33):**  It's based on an idea called consent, which is different than consensus in that not everybody  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:41):**  has to agree with every aspect of every proposal to move it forward, but instead relies on  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:47):**  this idea of consent, which is that all core team members that are involved in the decision-making  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:20:53):**  process don't necessarily have to be 100% on board, but that the proposal doesn't create  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:00):**  a situation where one of the core team members has a paramount objection to it moving forward.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:08):**  That's one example of how we're able to make decisions more efficiently now and more effectively  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:15):**  and in a way that integrates all of the decision-makers on our team.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:21):**  Similarly, just the financial systems, some quite conventional, but as small business  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:31):**  owners and as entrepreneurs early on in a project, in a business like this, we don't  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:38):**  oftentimes spend enough time on, but just tracking the money coming in and out and creating  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:45):**  systems that allow you to better understand your financial position on a day in and day  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:51):**  out basis.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:52):**  Early on, we were flying by the seat of our pants.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:21:55):**  If there was money in our pocket at the end of the week, then that would be great.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:00):**  If there wasn't, we'd have to figure out where to cut it, oftentimes hoping that we had enough  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:05):**  to make payroll that week.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:10):**  Now that we're a bit more mature and further on in the development of our organization,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:15):**  we really worked hard to put structures in place that allow us to better understand our  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:21):**  position.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:22):**  That, for us, is critically important as we think about how to compensate ourselves, how  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:29):**  to compensate the people that work with us.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:32):**  That's been a great step in being able to better understand the health of our bottom  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:40):**  line.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:41):**  Those are a couple of examples, as I'm sure the listeners have heard or know.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:49):**  Now, Tim, Rancho Mastatal has been a model of regenerative agriculture and natural building  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:54):**  since it was founded.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:22:56):**  Since I'm someone who also develops programs to educate students on these topics, I would  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:01):**  like to hear from you specifically how you continue to develop new and innovative ways  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:05):**  of teaching these things and how you keep the training and workshops from getting stale  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:10):**  or outdated.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:13):**  One of the strategies that we have is to try, to our best of our ability, to bring in new  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:20):**  teachers from time to time.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:23):**  In particular, with our natural building workshops, with our permaculture classes, we try to integrate  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:29):**  a new teacher or a few new teachers each year who are bringing slightly different skill  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:35):**  sets to the ranch, again, in an effort to keep fresh, as you suggested.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:43):**  That's one way.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:46):**  We are trying not to run the same exact class year after year.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:51):**  In the case of the permaculture design certification, that is a curriculum that is fairly well set.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:23:57):**  Again, by bringing in different teachers with different strengths, we're able to change  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:03):**  the curriculum around, I think, enough whereby it keeps it interesting for the folks that  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:10):**  are teaching it as well as the folks that are taking those classes.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:16):**  In addition to that, with the building classes, we are really trying to innovate as much as  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:23):**  possible how we're building our buildings.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:28):**  If you come around to the ranch campus, you'll see that a lot of the buildings are very  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:33):**  unique and different.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:35):**  None of the structures are like any of the other structures.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:39):**  So we're constantly trying to push ourselves to use different materials, to use different  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:45):**  techniques and to keep the profession interesting so that everybody can stay excited about those  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:53):**  topics.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:54):**  Now, what have been some of the most important things you've learned and taken away from  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:24:58):**  running Rancho Masatau for all these years?  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:01):**  Oh, let's see.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:03):**  Probably the number one lesson is that as I kind of get deeper into it, the more I understand  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:09):**  how much more I have to learn.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:15):**  There's so much that goes into running a project like ours.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:20):**  It's quite diverse.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:21):**  We're trying to do a lot.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:26):**  I'm just constantly humbled by the new information and new people, the new ideas that continue  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:36):**  to come through our door and change my world view.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:41):**  As a late 20-year-old or early 30-year-old, I thought that I more or less had it figured  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:45):**  out for me anyway.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:47):**  As I get deep into my 40s and close to the next decade, I realized that I will be a lifelong  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:57):**  student.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:25:59):**  That's been a really fulfilling idea to embrace.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:05):**  It's been really wonderful to realize that and understand that and certainly keeps us  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:13):**  on our toes here.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:16):**  Going back to the community piece a little bit that we talked about before, that's the  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:23):**  part I think that produces some of the most unique challenges, what I talked about before  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:29):**  living as an expat in rural Central America.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:35):**  Just being away from my family and the culture that I grew up in, those are challenges that  
**[0:26:44-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:44):**  continue to be real for me living so far from where I grew up, my siblings and my blood  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:53):**  family.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:54):**  Those continue to provide challenges.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:26:58):**  The list of challenges is much greater.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:00):**  I can go into a few others later on if we have the time.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:05):**  Yes, sure.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:06):**  I can relate to a few of those too.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:07):**  I as well hope to be a lifelong learner.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:10):**  The deeper I get into each of these things that I study, the more I realize that I could  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:14):**  study any one of them for my whole lifetime and probably still have a lot to learn.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:19):**  And as you said, I'm the oldest of five children in my family and I miss them all the time.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:27):**  Trying to find a way to balance my time traveling and doing projects for clients, but also getting  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:32):**  home and making sure that I spend time with them.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:37):**  What have been some of the biggest challenges and hurdles that you've had to overcome to  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:41):**  get Rancho Masatil where it is today?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:45):**  I think the one that jumps out right away is just the financial part.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:51):**  Just trying to figure out how to pull something like this off.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:55):**  We live quite rurally here.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:27:58):**  So figuring out how to get people to come to us and figure out, as I alluded to earlier,  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:06):**  how to pay the bills at the end of the month.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:09):**  In the very beginning, we had to get quite creative in coming up with a way to finance  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:17):**  the purchase of the land and to come here with a little bit of money to hit the ground  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:23):**  running with.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:26):**  And we've worked really hard and made many sacrifices to be able to make that work.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:34):**  After 16 years, I feel like we're getting to a good place.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:37):**  But even as recent as a few years ago, we were looking for ways to get more people to  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:46):**  our site who would be willing to pay for the food and lodging and the educational programs  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:52):**  so that we would be able to make it happen.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:28:57):**  Another big piece, I think, is the social piece.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:00):**  Going back to the expat conversation, but developing a project that would allow us to  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:08):**  thrive and be happy socially.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:13):**  We are fully integrated into this community, but there are certain aspects of our life  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:19):**  and of our project that keep that part really vibrant and interesting by having teachers  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:25):**  and professors and students and people from all over the world with different world views  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:31):**  and different ideas coming through our doors all the time really does inject us with a  
**[0:29:37-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:37):**  lot of excitement, a lot of great conversations, and that community, that network of supporters  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:45):**  and people that believe in our work has been really important, I think, to my personal  
**[0:29:52-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:29:52):**  happiness that otherwise I think would be hard for me living as early as we do in this  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:01):**  community without it, it would be, I think, a lot more challenging.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:04):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:06):**  Now, what advice would you give to others who want to set up regenerative development  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:11):**  sites or education centers like yours?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:15):**  I think doing your homework and thinking about the invisible structures that we talked about  
**[0:30:22-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:22):**  before, I'd share that advice having been someone that didn't do it that way, so perhaps  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:31):**  that might seem a little bit ironic, but I do believe now after learning what I have  
**[0:30:39-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:39):**  about some of these invisible structures that your chances of success are likely much higher  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:48):**  if you have thought about a lot of those issues prior to putting your feet on the ground and  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:54):**  starting something like this.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:30:56):**  There are a lot of great people with great ideas looking to start projects such as this,  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:05):**  and many of them don't pan out for a whole host of reasons, and what I would like to  
**[0:31:12-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:12):**  see personally is that places like this have a greater rate of success based on what we  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:20):**  have observed.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:21):**  There's a great demand and a great need for this type of lifestyle, this type of  
**[0:31:25-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:25):**  education, and the more places like this that succeed, the faster we'll get to changing  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:33):**  the economic paradigm, the environmental paradigm.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:36):**  We'll get closer to succeeding and hopefully reversing some of these incredibly serious  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:44):**  global issues that we're currently confronting as a society.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:50):**  Get your house in order.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:52):**  Think about the finances.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:53):**  Think about how you're going to compensate yourself.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:31:56):**  Think about how you're going to find balance in your life.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:01):**  Burnout is a reality.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:02):**  I think for many people that try to do this, there's always a lot to do, so developing  
**[0:32:08-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:08):**  strategies that allow you to stay balanced, that allow you to make efficient decisions,  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:16):**  that allow you to govern yourself and be successful financially.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:22):**  The more time and energy you think about, what your community is going to look like  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:26):**  and what your business is going to look like prior to opening your doors, I think the greater  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:31):**  chance of success.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:34):**  That's some really valuable advice.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:36):**  I am in certain steps and certain processes in helping either clients achieve these goals  
**[0:32:44-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:44):**  and in starting some of these myself.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:46):**  A lot of that really resonates with what has been my experience so far and also really  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:51):**  informs how I may reevaluate some of the ways that I proceed forward too.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:57):**  Thank you for that.  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:58):**  Yeah, my pleasure.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:32:59):**  Now, before I let you go, can you share with us how to get in contact with you or with  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:05):**  Rancho Mastatal or if you have any workshops or promotions that you'd like to mention now?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:10):**  Sure.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:11):**  Yeah, we've got a great website with a lot of information.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:16):**  It's ranchomastatal.com.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:19):**  We also have an active Facebook page.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:22):**  You can search for it at Rancho Mastatal.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:27):**  We are active with Instagram now more and more.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:30):**  We're embracing the social media wave that is overtaking our species, which has been  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:39):**  great for us in getting the word out about our work.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:43):**  You can email us at info at ranchomastatal.com and any other contact information you can  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:50):**  find on our website.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:53):**  We are kind of wrapping up with our workshop season a little bit.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:33:56):**  We do have a wilderness first response certification course coming up in a few months.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:02):**  Then our workshop schedule is starting to fill up for next year.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:06):**  We're kicking off next year with a bamboo construction workshop.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:11):**  That'll be followed by a wilderness medicine semester.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:15):**  We've got a Japanese plastering workshop on the docket.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:20):**  We have Japanese ferments, a farm to table ferment workshop, our annual permaculture  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:28):**  design certification class.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:30):**  We're repeating an agroforestry class as well as a medicinal plants class.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:37):**  We're due to get a homestead design class onto our calendar soon.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:45):**  That's coming up in the following year and people can stay updated at our website by  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:50):**  going to our workshop page.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:54):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:55):**  Well again, thank you so much for taking the time, Tim.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:34:57):**  I hope that we can possibly do a follow up to see how things continue to progress on  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:01):**  your site in the years to come.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:05):**  Thanks so much Oliver.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:06):**  I really appreciate the time.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:07):**  I wish you the best in your project and endeavors over there.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:09):**  Thank you.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:10):**  Take care.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:11):**  I'll be in touch.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:13):**  Alright, thank you.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:16):**  So there you have it.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:17):**  And now let's move on to this session's weekly tip.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:21):**  This time I want to focus on the importance of involving the community in your projects.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:26):**  Now Tim gave some great examples of the lengths that he's gone to in Costa Rica to reach out  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:30):**  to the town where they live and include them in their endeavors.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:34):**  He even shared some inspiring examples of people in the community who they now work  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:38):**  alongside with and who've had success following their lead.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:42):**  And while his experiences are unique, community integration can help anyone to reach levels  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:47):**  of success in their projects that would never be possible if they were to go it alone.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:52):**  I know that many of us, especially in the homesteading world, are very independent and  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:35:57):**  are even aiming for a goal of self-sufficiency in large part not to be dependent on the outside  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:03):**  world to support ourselves.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:05):**  I myself have had to overcome my own isolationist tendencies in order to reach out to neighbors  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:10):**  and friends for help many times.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:13):**  I'll use natural home building projects as an example, since that's the area where I  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:17):**  have the most experience.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:19):**  Often times, the clients who want natural buildings are also looking for a level of  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:23):**  seclusion and privacy in nature as a priority in their living environment.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:28):**  The irony in this is that you have to nurture good relationships to accomplish this.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:33):**  If you're butting heads with the people living around you, they're more likely to play their  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:36):**  music really loud or run heavy machinery that disturbs your sanctuary.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:41):**  In bad cases, they may even stop you from building, since many natural buildings try  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:46):**  to subvert codes and permits, and neighbors reporting the building is the number one reason  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:51):**  that unpermitted structures get shut down.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:54):**  On the other hand, if you've taken the time to build a friendship and be on good terms  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:36:58):**  with those in your community, they're much more likely to not only live peacefully next  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:03):**  to you, but even come over and help you build your home.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:06):**  Maybe they can lend you some tools, help you source recycled materials, or put you in touch  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:10):**  with others who can.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:12):**  But never forget either, that if you want enthusiastic help from your community, you're  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:16):**  going to have to be an enthusiastic contributor.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:19):**  What you get out is largely proportional to what you put in.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:22):**  Being able to rely on your community comes only after you've become a good member of  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:26):**  that community.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:28):**  So try to build community integration into all of your endeavors, you'll quickly find  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tim-ohara/#t=0:37:32):**  that the benefits are so much larger and varied than you might expect.

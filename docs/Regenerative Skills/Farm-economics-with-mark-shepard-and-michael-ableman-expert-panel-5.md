**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:11-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:11):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:13):**  I'm your host, Oliver Goshe.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:15):**  Hello and welcome back everybody to the fifth of the monthly expert panel discussions.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:21):**  Now, as I mentioned before, each month I'll be hosting discussions and debates between  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:25):**  some of the most prominent voices in regenerative agriculture, soil science, restoration land  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:31):**  management and more.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:33):**  In this session, I hosted a discussion on farm business and finances with my friends  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:37):**  and colleagues at Climate Farmers, a non-profit organization working to advance regenerative  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:42):**  agriculture in Europe.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:44):**  In this panel, I got two of my favorite voices on the subject of farm economics and business  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:48):**  advice to talk about how managing the whole ecosystem of their farms has saved them money  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:54):**  and improved the profitability of their businesses.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:00:57):**  Now, since these discussions are longer than the regular weekly episodes, I'll keep the  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:02):**  intro short and jump right into the introductions for our two panelists.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:06):**  Now, because of the demands of the heavy planting season in the springtime, Michael Abelman  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:11):**  wasn't able to join until later, so let's jump right in with Mark Shepherd.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:16):**  At the moment, we've got Mark Shepherd with us, who is the CEO of Forest Agriculture Enterprises,  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:21):**  LLC, and founder of Restoration Agriculture Development, LLC, as well as award-winning  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:27):**  author of the books Restoration Agriculture and Water for Any Farm.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:33):**  He's most widely known as the founder of New Forest Farm, the 106-acre perennial agricultural  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:38):**  savanna, considered by many to be one of the most ambitious sustainable agriculture projects  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:43):**  in the United States.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:45):**  And that's saying a lot because there's a lot of new ones these days.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:47):**  And you've got to like, that little line right there is the one line that bothers me because  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:01:53):**  it's not the actual one piece of real estate that makes it such a large project.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:00):**  There's a whole planet out here that needs to be ecologically restored while producing  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:05):**  food, fuels, medicines, fibers, and human habitat.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:08):**  That's the ambitious project.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:11):**  Very well said.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:12):**  And I'll give you a chance to expand on that by starting by exploring why managing the  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:17):**  health of your farm's entire ecosystem is essential for its profitability as a business  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:23):**  as well.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:24):**  Well, yeah.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:26):**  And part of it has to do with my perspective in that I see things through the eyes of an  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:37):**  ecologist.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:38):**  We're studying the health of living systems on planet earth.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:42):**  And let's just take an orchard, for example, 100% of all of the problems that you have  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:50):**  in an apple orchard are because we view the world through this intellectual concept called  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:02:57):**  orchard, which is rows of straight rows of trees and nothing shall bother it, et cetera,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:04):**  et cetera.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:05):**  That starting with that idea, the idea is just wrong.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:08):**  It's a falsehood.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:09):**  This is not how this planet rolls.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:12):**  So what now become expenses in an orchard to manage an orchard, those are all you trying  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:20):**  to recover health to this system.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:24):**  That's not even true.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:25):**  It's not even based on nature.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:27):**  So if we have a healthy ecosystem, a full, complete ecosystem that includes apples in  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:34):**  it, we may get fewer apples per Hector.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:39):**  And if we had an orchard, but our problems quote unquote go away because we're emphasizing  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:45):**  the overall ecosystem health.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:47):**  And what's great about ecosystem health is much of that can be accomplished using life  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:53):**  forms that grow and propagate.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:03:57):**  And you can either sell the life forms, the products of the life forms, the offspring  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:01):**  of those life forms, they generate and regenerate themselves basically free of charge because  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:08):**  they live there happily as can be.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:10):**  So when you have that healthy whole complete ecosystem, your costs, your dollar costs to  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:16):**  manage it go way, way down.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:19):**  Did I successfully avoid answering the question or?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:21):**  No, no, no, you answered it perfectly.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:23):**  I just didn't expect you to answer it so succinctly.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:27):**  So yeah, so that's a really good overview of changing the mindset around a lot of our  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:34):**  production methods as they are currently.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:38):**  I'd also like to explore some of the top three investments or some of the top investments  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:44):**  in your own farms ecology, which has saved you the most money over time.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:49):**  They give some examples from your own context.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:04:54):**  Well the investments I've made that have been the most beneficial over time have been setting  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:04):**  the property up as an ecological system that mimics a historic natural plant community  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:11):**  type of the area for one.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:14):**  Because once you set up a system that is ecologically in line with the place where you live, all  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:23):**  of the forces of nature of succession, all these weeds that are coming into your system,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:28):**  they're driving you forward instead of fighting against nature and natural processes or pro  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:34):**  processes for the Canadians in the audience, we're working along with them.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:39):**  And as far as dollars returns within that system, I'm hesitant to say one or two things  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:48):**  work great because I deal with this with clients all the time.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:51):**  They look at spreadsheets with multiple different crops and multiple different enterprises.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:05:55):**  They say, oh, look, this black currents, for example, black currents make way more money  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:00):**  per hectare than any other crop in this.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:03):**  Just get rid of everything else and just plant black currents.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:06):**  Well, what you just did is you just lost the synergies between them and you missed the  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:10):**  opportunities for emergent properties that you never would have expected if you had that  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:16):**  full diverse ecosystem in place.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:22):**  So they aren't the only revenue stream coming from the property, but the two individual  
**[0:06:30-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:30):**  crops that are the highest performing crops economically are hazelnuts, asparagus, and  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:38):**  followed closely by livestock.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:41):**  And the reason why livestock hasn't made more is because I only want to deal with so many,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:45):**  it just gets out of control and I hate moving fence and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:49):**  Well, that's a perfect example of how you've sort of narrowed down the things that work  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:53):**  for you and what it is that you're personally trying to accomplish, not only through the  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:06:57):**  ecology there, but also on the business end.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:00):**  Can you tell us a little bit about how you narrow down the options when looking at the  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:06):**  overall picture of what you were trying to accomplish on the landscape as far as that  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:10):**  profitability like you mentioned?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:13):**  That's really interesting too, because narrowing down the options wasn't necessarily something  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:18):**  that I did by choice.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:19):**  I didn't have to look at spreadsheets or anything like that.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:21):**  And a great example was daffodils for cut flowers.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:27):**  I've got, I don't know, 85, 83 zillion daffodils out on the farm.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:32):**  I planted them around my fruit trees for sod control because they actually do eliminate  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:38):**  sod underneath your fruit trees.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:39):**  They also repel rodents, so you don't have rodent damage girdling your trees.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:44):**  And for a while I was just selling literally, you know, huge arm loads of daffodils.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:50):**  At the time I was getting about a dime per stem.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:53):**  Well, then what happened is all of a sudden the asparagus started to kick in and they  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:07:58):**  overlapped in seasons.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:00):**  So I just forgot about doing the daffodils and went to pick in the asparagus.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:05):**  And I found out that, well, you know what, there's a lot more dollars on my farm in the  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:09):**  asparagus than there is in the daffodils.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:11):**  I might as well concentrate on the daffodils.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:15):**  What's nice about having the whole system in place is the fact that I still have the  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:19):**  daffodils.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:20):**  So if I want to, I can go back and I can start harvesting the daffodils.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:24):**  I still have hay that I can cut on my farm.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:27):**  I haven't cut hay since like the late 90s, the last big drought, because I had green  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:33):**  grass and nobody else did so I could cut hay and sell it.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:37):**  But I have it if I need it.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:39):**  So having that complete ecosystem gives us options that we wouldn't have otherwise if  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:45):**  we didn't plant the full complete system.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:48):**  It sounds like you've got a whole bunch of byproducts of creating an entire ecosystem  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:08:54):**  that you can choose to focus on based on what the price of them are, what fits in with your  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:00):**  lifestyle and your management strategy, and also the time of the year or the season that  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:05):**  is congruent to making money off of those.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:09):**  Was that what you went into the design planning for?  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:13):**  Or did that kind of come about as the ecosystem started to develop and mature and gaining  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:20):**  complexity?  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:21):**  Well, theoretically, we knew that that was going to happen through time, but we've never  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:27):**  done this.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:28):**  You know, as far as I knew, when we got started, nobody had tried to do a ecosystem, a managed  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:33):**  ecosystem as their profit center of the full complete thing, everything from, you know,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:39):**  annual plants to, you know, long live perennials.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:41):**  We didn't know anyone who had done that before.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:44):**  So we knew we were going to learn all along the way.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:47):**  And so a lot of my, you know, systems and people say, Oh, what a brilliant system.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:52):**  It's like, No, no, no, no, it wasn't a brilliant system.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:54):**  I just couldn't keep up with that.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:55):**  So I let it go.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:56):**  I couldn't keep up with that.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:57):**  So I let it go.  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:58):**  I hate this.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:09:59):**  And so I don't do it.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:00):**  One of the mentioned through the seasons and through the years, well, one of the things  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:06):**  that's happening with the system, if it started with the annual crop field, corn and beans  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:10):**  fields, etc, which it did.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:12):**  Now it's changing through time, some of our pioneer trees are beginning to interfere with  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:17):**  our crop trees.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:19):**  So they got to come down.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:21):**  Now I knew that I was going to get into harvesting timber at some point in time, I didn't know  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:26):**  when.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:28):**  But it was about year 10 that I started to be able to harvest hybrid poplar timber for  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:33):**  for cutting into lumber.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:35):**  And then I built a process in building with that lumber.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:38):**  Well, those hybrid poplars have since sprouted back.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:42):**  And in order to keep them from shading out other crop trees like walnut and chestnut  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:46):**  and hazelnut, I'm removing them as almost as fast as I can.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:50):**  And I and literally I can't keep up because I've got thousands of them.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:10:55):**  And we've moved into producing mushrooms, especially oyster mushrooms, like never before,  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:03):**  not because we necessarily wanted to not because we planned on it, not because we were brilliant  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:08):**  and designed it that way, because we got to get rid of all this wood.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:12):**  And the wood is going to decompose, well, we might as well decompose it with an edible  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:16):**  mushroom that's super good for you.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:18):**  And what's really fascinating is it happens to be really high in beta glucans, which is  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:25):**  antiviral.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:27):**  And so huh, isn't it fascinating that it might be nice to have some like antiviral and tons  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:32):**  of zinc in it as well.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:33):**  And then those of you in northern climates, Wisconsin and Minnesota is very gray and cloudy  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:41):**  in the wintertime.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:42):**  And you know, blue and gray is all the color you see.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:45):**  And oyster mushrooms are super high in vitamin D. And so it's like perfectly timed to all  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:52):**  of a sudden have an excess amount of oyster mushrooms that shucks we have to sell for  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:56):**  six bucks a pound.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:11:58):**  Oh, brilliant, brilliant.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:01):**  So to give some of our listeners who perhaps are not as familiar with your systems as I've  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:05):**  become over the years, can you tell them about your tree planting method that you've become  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:09):**  known for the stun method and kind of the backstory of why you have so many extra trees  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:15):**  that you need to harvest now?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:16):**  All right, that goes to the multiple enterprises.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:19):**  Well, the the stun method isn't necessarily tree planting method, but it's a tree breeding  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:26):**  and selection method.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:30):**  And if you look at the ditch on the side of the road, no matter where you are, even in  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:33):**  the Netherlands, the most insanely groomed place that I've ever been in the world, they  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:37):**  still have brush grown in the ditch.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:41):**  That brush was not not planted cloud, nobody used herbicide, fungicide, pesticide, site  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:47):**  preparation, cover crops, nobody did anything to it, it still grows.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:52):**  And it's hyper dense, this trees that are literally, you know, 568 centimeters apart.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:12:58):**  And what happens is they sort themselves out through time.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:02):**  And the trees that have whatever genetic magic it is to survive and thrive, and then reproduce,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:09):**  they're the ones that survive there.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:10):**  So that's exactly what nature does in order to come up with the individual plants, the  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:15):**  cultivars that will survive there.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:18):**  Not one grain of pollen from a flower, put it in another flower, put a bag on it and  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:23):**  pray and then put it in a stainless steel environment, whip it up and tissue culture  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:28):**  and clone it and send it out over zillions of acres.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:30):**  That's not how nature works.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:32):**  So by planting too many trees of seedlings, instead of finding one true, high performing  
**[0:13:43-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:43):**  individual, we breed a population that's fit, and it can survive the soil as it is, the  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:51):**  weather as it is, the climate, the highs, the lows, the wind, the ice, all of the hassles  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:13:57):**  that we can possibly throw at it, the ones that survive are the ones that survive our  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:03):**  disturbance regime, our selection criteria.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:07):**  When you plant trees, go ahead and plant way too many, go ahead and plant seedlings.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:15):**  And you'll have all of the horticulturists and orchardists and university people telling  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:19):**  you you're the biggest fool in the world.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:21):**  Well, you know what?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:22):**  They have salaries and they have life insurance and health insurance and they work in these  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:27):**  nice little buildings and they have nice little controlled experiments.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:31):**  I live on planet earth and it's the real world out here and they're cute little experiments,  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:36):**  although very, very precise and very well researched.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:40):**  You know, they kind of fall on their face when you try to put them to use in the real  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:43):**  world.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:44):**  And then you say, oh, it failed.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:46):**  And I got to buy another input to kind of control it to act like a laboratory.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:50):**  So with planting too many trees using seedlings, my input costs drop down to almost zero.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:14:59):**  If I do anything to my trees, I'm now like with the hybrid poplars, I'm removing the  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:03):**  trees and dog on it, I get firewood, which is great for fuel.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:08):**  I got building material to build a building out of and I get mushrooms that I can sell  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:11):**  and eat as antivirals.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:13):**  They don't teach you that in universities and you can't research that and you have to  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:17):**  respond to that and react to that on the fly.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:20):**  Now how did I get that many?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:22):**  How did that, how did I get to that strategy and how did I get that many trees on the farm?  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:31):**  One of the things that I've done that structurally it's invisible, it's not biological or agricultural  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:38):**  is the real estate, the land itself is owned by a real estate investment company that,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:45):**  you know, I'm the general partner of a limited partnership.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:49):**  That's the real estate owning entity.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:52):**  It can take investors if it wants, it can borrow if it wants all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:15:56):**  Its job is to invest in real estate and then improve the value of the real estate by doing  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:03):**  ecological restoration that pays its own way.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:07):**  So that's one behind the scenes step.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:10):**  Well, okay, now there's this piece of real estate.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:12):**  How do we, how do we get the water management systems in place?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:17):**  How do we plant the agroforestry systems?  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:19):**  Well, there needs to be a farming entity that actually is going to farm the land.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:25):**  And so that's New Forest Farms LLC.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:27):**  And that actually is the agricultural products that are sold from the farm.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:34):**  That's the livestock, the mushrooms, apples, grapes, and so on.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:39):**  Mostly it's been organic produce for years and years and years asparagus being the kingpin  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:44):**  of the produce.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:45):**  Well, where does it get the trees from?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:48):**  Because it can't afford to buy trees because it doesn't have any money.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:51):**  Well, there's the forest agriculture nursery, that is a tree and shrub nursery that at first  
**[0:16:59-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:16:59):**  started by buying trees wholesale from catalogs back in the day.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:07):**  You buy a thousand trees, you get the thousand tree rate, which is very affordable compared  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:13):**  to buying two trees and paying a two tree rate.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:16):**  Well, then I would plant the trees that I wanted to have in a particular system, I would  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:20):**  sell a bunch of trees and mark them up.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:23):**  So if I bought a trees at a thousand rate, you only want 100 trees, well, I'll sell them  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:28):**  to you at the 500 rate.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:30):**  So I'm cutting you a deal and I'm getting a deal because your trees are paying for my  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:34):**  trees.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:35):**  So all of the trees that go into the ground at New Forest Farm have gone in either at  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:40):**  no charge or at a profit.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:43):**  And then as my trees started to reproduce, and that was really quick because my first  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:51):**  selection criteria is hyperprecocity, really fast turnaround till when they produce nuts  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:56):**  or fruits.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:17:57):**  And I take those seeds and put them in the ground.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:00):**  So here's the farmer, New Forest Farm goes out and gathers all these seed.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:05):**  It's got to sell the seeds.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:06):**  So it sells the seeds to the nursery.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:08):**  The nursery puts them in the ground, grows them into trees, sells what it can, then the  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:12):**  surplus get planted on the land that the farmer now manages.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:16):**  So all three of those enterprises work together to improve the value of the real estate and  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:23):**  then how the real estate holding entity has cash flowed through time.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:28):**  And this is not the only property that I've done this on.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:30):**  I've done it on numerous properties.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:33):**  It then can refinance paying off the lower value on the loan because you've been paying  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:40):**  through time.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:42):**  And the property has increased, refinanced, take that and buy another degraded piece of  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:47):**  property and do the same thing.  
**[0:18:50-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:18:50):**  And so I've been a non-selling real estate flipper since 1986.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:00):**  I've done it on thousands of acres in multiple states all across the USA.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:06):**  It works.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:07):**  It works financially.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:08):**  Yeah, I have no doubt.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:10):**  And that's a really cool complimentary enterprise to the others that you mentioned as well.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:15):**  Now I believe Michael may have joined us.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:18):**  So I just want to make sure that he's in here and see if he can join in the conversation.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:21):**  Michael you here with us?  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:24):**  For my lateness, I won't get into the details.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:27):**  Good to see you Michael.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:30):**  Nice to see you all.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:32):**  I'm afraid I'm coming into this a bit cold.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:35):**  So tell me what I need to do and I'll do it.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:39):**  Well, let me quickly give everybody a little primer on who you are and why you're joining

**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:46):**  So everyone who's listening, Michael Abelman is here.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:49):**  He's a farmer, author, photographer, and urban and local food systems advocate who's been  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:19:54):**  farming organically since the early 1970s and is considered one of the pioneers of the  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:00):**  organic farming and urban agricultural movements.

**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:15):**  Did I miss anything important there, Michael?  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:19):**  That's enough.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:20):**  Okay, cool.

**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:23):**  I know you're on a tight schedule being in planting season and we have so far been talking  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:29):**  about farm ecology and Mark has been giving us an overview of how he got started, some  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:34):**  of the many different enterprises on his farm, and we've been exploring different questions  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:38):**  about profitability by managing the entire ecology of a farm.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:44):**  Now that you're here, could you give us a little bit of a primer on your own experience?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:50):**  In your own experience managing the ecology on your farms, can you tell us about how those  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:20:55):**  steps have saved you money or increased the profitability of the farm business?  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:00):**  Okay, wow.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:02):**  That's a big question.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:04):**  What I think I'll do is give you just a real brief overview and I'm hoping, Oliver, assuming  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:11):**  that we can allow all those in attendance to then drive the conversation based on Q&A,  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:17):**  is that right?  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:18):**  Hopefully.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:19):**  That's right.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:20):**  In the last half an hour, we'll be doing our Q&A then.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:22):**  I'm going to be real brief because I'm a little unprepared, but I've been involved with a  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:27):**  number of projects both here in British Columbia and in California.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:33):**  I spent 25 years on this same farm project in California, 12 and a half acres.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:40):**  We produced a hundred different fruits and vegetables.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:44):**  We employed 30 people.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:47):**  We were feeding fruits and vegetables to roughly 400 to 500 families and we were generating  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:54):**  about a million dollars US in gross income.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:21:59):**  Now, at that time, and this was up until 20 years ago because I've been here in BC for  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:05):**  a while, those numbers didn't make any sense at all to anyone, certainly those involved  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:12):**  with agricultural economics.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:17):**  It didn't make sense.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:18):**  We were told all along the way that it wasn't possible to do what we were doing on that  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:24):**  scale.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:26):**  How were we able to do that?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:28):**  Well, you mentioned the word ecology and I think I'm very careful about how I use language.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:37):**  I think there's many definitions of that as there is economy.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:41):**  But I would say that the ecological elements of what we did there really drove our ability  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:50):**  to achieve the numbers that I just described.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:22:54):**  It was highly intensive, but it was highly intensive ecologically as much as it was production  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:02):**  wise.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:07):**  I'll give you one example.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:09):**  We had a small block and most people are, everyone's from around the world, I guess  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:14):**  here.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:15):**  Is that right?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:16):**  Okay.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:17):**  I'm hoping I'm not talking to just northerners because when I start talking about the avocados  
**[0:23:20-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:20):**  and citrus, I'll see people jumping off the call, but we grew a lot of avocados and citrus.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:28):**  There was one particular block of avocado trees that had been planted literally the  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:34):**  year I was born, 1954.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:37):**  I was not there for that, but I was managing that orchard.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:41):**  The orchard was managed not so much as an orchard as it was a forest.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:48):**  If you walked into that block of trees and sat down and began digging around, it was  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:55):**  as if you were in some ancient forest.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:23:59):**  The soils beneath those trees were incredibly rich and dynamic with all of the elements  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:05):**  of a native or natural ecosystem.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:09):**  The result, of course the trees were like 40, 50 feet tall.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:13):**  The result was unbelievable productivity.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:17):**  In a very small space, essentially mimicking natural systems and making use of vertical  
**[0:24:28-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:28):**  space, I have to add that in, that very tiny block generated probably 20 to 30 times what  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:36):**  it would have in a conventional system.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:39):**  I'm going to jump ahead and again, I'm going to be really brief.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:45):**  We moved 1200 miles north, been on Salt Spring Island for the last 22 years.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:24:54):**  Our family farm is 120 acre, one of the original homesteads on the island.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:00):**  It is as completely dynamically different from that experience in California, 12 and  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:06):**  a half acres floating in a sea of tract homes and shopping centers.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:10):**  This is 120 acres surrounded by completely protected land.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:16):**  What we've seen here, which is remarkable, is that our fields are intersected and intertwined  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:25):**  and surrounded by native forest.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:29):**  I don't really understand it entirely, but I have discovered that there's definitely  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:33):**  something going on there, most of which I cannot visibly see, except again in the productivity  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:41):**  of the things we're growing.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:43):**  There is a dynamic happening in relationship between those forests and those fields.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:49):**  They're smaller fields, as I said, and intersected with native forest.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:25:54):**  We have also seen production levels that are unmatched.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:01):**  I'm pretty convinced that there's something going on in relationship to what surrounds  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:06):**  those fields.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:07):**  It's not a big massive agricultural operation.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:12):**  Here we're growing very different things.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:13):**  We're growing grain and beans, fruits and vegetables as well, limited amount of livestock.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:21):**  I wouldn't call this necessarily a fully integrated farm because the emphasis on fruits and vegetables  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:28):**  is much higher.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:29):**  That's predominantly for economic reasons.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:32):**  That's what pays the bills.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:34):**  The grain, the dry beans, the little bit of hay we do, the little bit of livestock we  
**[0:26:41-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:41):**  do do not generate income in and of themselves, but they contribute to the whole.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:50):**  They contribute to the whole ecologically as well.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:54):**  The last thing is our project in Vancouver, which I don't know how to address ecology  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:26:59):**  there because we're producing food on huge parking lots.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:03):**  It's primarily a social enterprise designed to provide employment for people who are dealing  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:08):**  with long-term addiction, mental illness.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:12):**  We are operating on about four acres of pavement using an innovative box system that we've  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:16):**  designed that isolates the growing medium from either pavement or contaminated soils  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:22):**  and allows us to move on short notice.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:26):**  We produce about somewhere around 40 to 50 tons of food annually.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:32):**  That's a lot of greens.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:35):**  That's all done with the hands of people who not only had no agricultural experience, but  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:40):**  who are dealing with some pretty heavy stuff.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:45):**  The term ecology there would be extended to human ecology as well.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:51):**  What's happening with the people we're working with, what the influences have been on the  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:27:56):**  neighborhood, the ecology that's actually been created on the sites themselves as every  
**[0:28:03-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:03):**  bird and skunk and everything else that has no home anymore finds their way in.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:12):**  So I'm going to leave it at that.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:14):**  That was not a very good...  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:16):**  I'm not sure if I answered your question, but I'll end it there.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:20):**  No, no, that's perfect.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:22):**  That gives an idea for the listeners of all the different systems that you have worked  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:26):**  with so far.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:27):**  It's a great segue into the next question I was going to ask.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:30):**  One of these things that constantly comes up both in regenerative agriculture and permaculture  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:34):**  is trying to find that delicate balance between the diversity needed for a resilient and healthy  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:41):**  ecology and the efficiency needed to run a profitable business.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:45):**  So I'm going to actually throw to Mark here who was starting to touch on this topic a  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:50):**  little bit earlier.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:52):**  Can you tell us how you found that balance on your own farm so that you're still able  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:28:56):**  to run it as a business, but making sure that the ecology is not, I guess, put to the side  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:03):**  in the effort to create a profit?  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:06):**  Well, one of the things that I wanted to jump in when Michael was talking last, because  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:12):**  he hit on something that was absolutely critical is in his circumstances, the produce is the  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:18):**  cashflow and that's what takes care of the whole thing.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:20):**  And that's what's my circumstance as well.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:23):**  One of the issues with produce is you need to have enough.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:28):**  You can grow a ton, several tons in a very small space, but you need to have enough of  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:34):**  anything in order to make it economically worth your while to go out, harvest it, package  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:39):**  it, post harvest handling, then deliver it to whoever's producing it.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:43):**  And so one of the economic strategies that I also employed, I was one of the early members,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:50):**  not initial founding members, but I was one of the early members of the Organic Valley  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:53):**  Cooperative.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:29:55):**  And so what we were able to do as a group of produce growers is instead of having like  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:01):**  the 100,000 different varieties that Michael grows in his operation, we could each pick  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:06):**  three or four, whatever worked for our operation.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:09):**  And so with produce, I'd have asparagus in the springtime while I'm getting my site prepared  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:15):**  for my summer crop, which was usually either zucchini or cucumbers.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:19):**  Then my late summer crop was green peppers and I'd finished the fall with mostly acorn  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:24):**  squash and pie pumpkins.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:26):**  That would give me something through the seasons.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:28):**  So I wasn't overwhelmed at any one point in time.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:31):**  Well, if you notice my fingers, well, now there's these rows of polycultures of trees  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:36):**  in between.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:37):**  I had to have enough of any one crop.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:40):**  Apples, chestnuts and hazelnuts and pine nuts are my biggest woody crops.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:48):**  And if you go out and you plant four hazelnut bushes, well, good for you.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:51):**  You've got some hazelnut snacks, but if you actually want to make it worth your while  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:55):**  to get out there and harvest it, husk them.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:30:58):**  You need the equipment for husking it and for cracking and sorting and sizing and all  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:02):**  that.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:03):**  You need enough or you need to join with others.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:06):**  And so my ecological system is way more diverse than that, but I don't harvest everything.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:14):**  And I basically only harvest what I can keep up with.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:17):**  And that includes livestock.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:19):**  I can only handle like three or four crops above ground and two, maybe three species  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:26):**  of animal before I just go crazy.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:27):**  I can't handle it all.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:29):**  And so I just don't do the others because someone had mentioned, hey, well, how do you  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:32):**  manage your hay if you're not cutting it?  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:34):**  It's like, well, I don't.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:36):**  Pretty easy, low cost.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:39):**  So does that make any sense at all?  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:41):**  Yeah, perfect.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:42):**  And Michael, you talked about all of the different elements that you have on your farm in BC  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:48):**  and that some of them are not even cultivated specifically to gain a profit from them, but  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:54):**  they fit in with the health of the ecosystem.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:56):**  Can you talk about that, how you made those decisions?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:31:59):**  Yeah, so the decisions of the crop mix decisions are both made from the perspective of the  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:08):**  ecology that we're working with, but they're also made in respect of the community that  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:15):**  we're serving.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:17):**  So while there are a number of things that I know we produce that don't actually generate  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:23):**  net income in and of themselves, they are part of the broader palette that we have to  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:29):**  offer our community so that when someone comes to me at the farmer's market or as part of  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:35):**  our box program, they know that they can get a full range of foods that they need.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:42):**  And I think that, interestingly enough, that kind of, again, social ecology, if you will,  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:50):**  and community ecology, tends to support the farm ecology as well.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:32:55):**  I mean, it's kind of a cliche that diversity is a key component of ecological stability.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:07):**  Although I think there are some exceptions to that, nature certainly, but I think there  
**[0:33:14-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:14):**  is truth in that on our farm, although I'm not convinced that the sustainability of the  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:23):**  people doing the work are supported by that, and it's kind of like what Mark was saying.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:29):**  The more diversity you have, the more complexity of management, the more difficult it is for  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:35):**  the people doing the work.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:37):**  The more interesting it is, the less boring it is, but I'm not sure how sustainable it  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:42):**  is for the farmer themselves.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:46):**  We talk about sustainability often without considering the people who are actually doing  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:50):**  the work.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:33:52):**  I will say that row crops, vegetables in particular, the annuals, it requires a lot more careful  
**[0:34:01-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:01):**  consideration and thinking to grow those products in a way that does not become a mining operation  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:10):**  on your soils.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:14):**  Our perennials, we do a lot of perennials, and I'm very satisfied with my ability to  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:21):**  support ecological stability with the perennials.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:26):**  But with the annuals, because of the turning of soil, the churning and turning that happens,  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:33):**  it requires a lot more attention, a lot more consideration, and a lot more care.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:38):**  And I think that the way we have achieved some of that is that we don't have huge blocks  
**[0:34:43-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:43):**  of one particular product.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:45):**  There's a lot of intermixing that goes on.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:47):**  And we're now farming with understories of clover.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:50):**  We're doing vegetables with understories of clover, and we're doing a lot of experimentation  
**[0:34:56-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:34:56):**  in regards to mixing our cover crops and our edible crops, humanities crop and nature crop  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:07):**  at the same time, rather than the separate cover cropping that's often done in the winter  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:14):**  months.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:15):**  I'm drifting.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:16):**  Bring me back, Oliver.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:17):**  If I could make a wave on either side of your boat, to dovetail with what you were talking  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:22):**  about, Michael, having certain things that were not necessarily economically profitable,  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:26):**  and the same is the situation on my farm.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:29):**  And if we're doing alley cropping with rows of trees, with an alley of whatever our cash  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:34):**  crop is in between, if we're doing produce, for example, that requires a good high fertility,  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:41):**  we definitely have a set and it's, I kind of call it like time of mining or small scale  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:47):**  mining.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:48):**  I'll take a year, sometimes two years with various different cover crop mixes to build  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:53):**  up.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:54):**  And then I go into a heavy feeder that can tolerate turning under a sod like my winter  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:35:58):**  squash, then I want something that doesn't get a lot of fertility.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:02):**  So it puts more into fruit like my green peppers.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:05):**  And then immediately after that, I go back into a two year rotation that includes the  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:09):**  grains and the legumes.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:11):**  The grains and the legumes aren't generating a cash revenue, but they're essential for  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:17):**  rebuilding that the organic matter that you're losing and recovering any mobile nutrients  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:23):**  that were in the soil.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:25):**  And so they're not necessarily economic, but they're critical for the economics.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:30):**  And is this all within the mindset of trying to reduce any offsite inputs into the system?  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:37):**  Or is it really just for boosting the productivity of those primary producers that you had planned  
**[0:36:43-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:43):**  for?  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:44):**  Do you address it, Michael or me?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:47):**  I guess both of you have similar ways of rotating those.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:51):**  But since you just mentioned it, Mark, I was directing that to you.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:36:54):**  Well, my crop inputs are drastically reduced, simply because there's so very little nutrients  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:03):**  that get exported from the site and very little leaching, because we're recovering it again  
**[0:37:08-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:08):**  with deep rooted cover crops.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:18):**  What was the question?  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:19):**  Michael, help me.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:20):**  Your turn.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:21):**  Yeah, so I'm not attempting to reduce inputs.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:30):**  It's just that if you look at once again, the ditch on the side of the road, there really  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:34):**  are no positive beneficial inputs to the ditch on the side of the road and it thrives.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:39):**  So we can manage a system with minimal inputs, if we're using these species that are now  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:45):**  being genetically driven to adapt and evolve to the site as they are.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:50):**  That said, you're never going to get broccoli to behave on an alkaline rock.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:37:57):**  So there will be inputs necessary for my cash crops, my asparagus, for example, and my cucumbers  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:38:04):**  or green peppers.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:38:07):**  I'll just add that living on an island has taught me a lot.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:38:16):**  Just because you live on an island doesn't necessarily mean that you think like an island.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:38:22):**  I think the key is thinking like an island.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:38:29):**  For me, the opportunity that's been provided here is that, number one, it's just simply  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:38:36):**  more expensive to bring things in, a lot more expensive.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:38:41):**  So that alone has forced me to rethink some of the things I'm doing in regards to inputs.  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:38:52):**  We have really evolved a system that is moving towards, not there, we haven't arrived, but  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:00):**  moving towards or attempting to move towards considering the farm as its own island, as  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:07):**  its own self-supporting ecosystem, so that most of our nutritional needs can be generated  
**[0:39:15-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:15):**  on site.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:16):**  Now, that's easy for me to say now on 120 acres than it was for me to say when I was  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:21):**  on 12 acres, because we have the ability to lengthen our rotations and to do things that  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:27):**  we just couldn't do before.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:31):**  But I think that wherever one is farming, it's really important to consider the possibility  
**[0:39:41-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:41):**  of how much nutrition and nutrient and recirculation and recycling can be generated just within  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:49):**  your own farm.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:51):**  How much can you consider that farm as its own self-supporting ecosystem?  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:39:57):**  And what is really necessary to bring in from the outside?  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:00):**  And I will repeat again that the annual crops demand much more inputs.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:07):**  And that's where the challenge is.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:09):**  That's where the edge is.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:10):**  So Michael, just a question.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:13):**  Do you have your own composting operation on site or multiple sites?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:18):**  How do you deal with that?  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:20):**  On site.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:21):**  I'm just talking about Fox Club Farm now.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:23):**  Right.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:24):**  I'm not talking about...  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:25):**  Whole Foods Street Farms is a whole other animal.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:30):**  We do all our own onsite composting at Fox Club Farm.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:39):**  We're kind of religious cover croppers, both winter cover cropping and also permanent cover  
**[0:40:46-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:46):**  cropping.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:47):**  As I mentioned, we're now interplanning a lot within permanent cover crops.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:53):**  So yes.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:40:56):**  Well here with the last 15 minutes or so that we've got before I give it over to the participants  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:00):**  to ask their questions, let me focus a little bit on your own business models and especially  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:04):**  the different ways that you have found to market so as not to get into the cycle of  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:08):**  commodity crop determination or the price determination from outside, which really takes  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:14):**  away the autonomy of farmers of basically how they produce.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:18):**  Mark, you were talking about earlier how you're an early participant in Organic Valley, which  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:26):**  is a very well known organic produce seller in the United States.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:31):**  Can you talk about that decision and how it's determined the way that you sell and produce  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:37):**  on your own farm?  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:39):**  That decision was probably one of the best that I've made.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:42):**  And the reason why it went false when you were talking about how it takes away all your  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:46):**  autonomy and the low price, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:48):**  Well what we've done is we basically pool our resources together and then we put it  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:54):**  on a truck and it goes wholesale.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:41:56):**  So we're not going direct to retail, not direct to the consumer with the majority of the product.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:01):**  And what that does is the price gets set by the market, Whole Foods for example.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:08):**  And basically you will, and actually what's even worse than that, it's Cal Organics and  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:14):**  UNFI that are basically setting all the price.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:17):**  And so you have to deal with that.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:18):**  There's no way you're going to be able to sell cucumbers for more than what the market  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:23):**  will bear.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:24):**  So what ends up happening is you have to produce them at below the cost.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:28):**  Well, if you're going to be doing it with a high input system, like in an urban farm  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:32):**  situation, there's so much hand labor going in and so much high intensity going in that  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:38):**  you have to get a higher price just to recoup your expenses.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:41):**  Whereas if you're doing things the way I've been doing it, really low key laid back, not  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:46):**  putting a lot of effort into any one thing.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:50):**  And then, man, Michael, my produce fields would probably make you sick with the weeds  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:56):**  and the competition.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:42:57):**  It's just a mess.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:00):**  And then I go out and they pick the stuff and I only sell the perfect stuff.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:04):**  And it works when you reduce your inputs below a certain point and the market drives the  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:09):**  price.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:10):**  And that's how it is.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:12):**  So that was a really good move on my part.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:14):**  And the biggest reason why I did that and I like it, I think I might be part Asperger's  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:23):**  is because if I'm on my topic, I can talk about this kind of stuff all the time.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:27):**  I'm really outgoing, really flamboyant, informational.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:30):**  If I start talking about shoes or trucks or any, I don't know what other people talk about.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:37):**  I can't stand people.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:38):**  They're just like, it's pointless stuff.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:40):**  This is important.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:42):**  So I did it because I couldn't stand being at farmer's market.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:45):**  I was going to strangle people who complained that they had to pay 50 cents for a cucumber.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:49):**  It's like, well, go buy a cucumber from Michael.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:53):**  So that's why I enjoy it.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:54):**  They pay a dollar for me.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:57):**  Let's cause you're polite.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:02):**  So I think that hits on a little bit of that.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:06):**  For sure, what about you, Michael, and the different avenues to market that you found  
**[0:44:09-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:09):**  in order to basically keep as much of the revenue into the farm as possible?  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:16):**  Well first of all, I think Mark's right.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:19):**  If you're going to direct market, you have to have the personality or the desire to do  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:23):**  that.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:24):**  You have to want to be in that situation.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:25):**  And frankly, not everybody does.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:28):**  And some people get into farming because they want more isolation, not social interaction.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:36):**  So the nature of what we do requires that we do a lot of direct marketing.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:47):**  The return is higher.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:49):**  However, there is a significant investment if you're going to do farmer's markets of  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:54):**  time and displays, et cetera.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:58):**  So we have a slightly diverse marketing scheme.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:03):**  We have a box program.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:06):**  And again, I'll talk about both Fox Club Farm and Soul Food Street Farms.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:11):**  Both have well over anywhere in the range of 150 to 200 members in a box program.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:21):**  We do two farmer's markets a week at Fox Club.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:23):**  And in Vancouver, there's three.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:27):**  We also have sales to restaurants, or we did, I should say.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:33):**  That ended a year ago, sadly.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:38):**  And all of those things, the nature of your marketing informs the nature of what you grow,  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:45):**  what you grow, and how you grow it to some degree.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:49):**  All these things are tied together in kind of a web.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:53):**  So these are good questions because the ecology, the marketing, the economy, the crop mix,  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:01):**  all these things are connected.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:03):**  And so when I'm making decisions, I'm thinking about all these elements together.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:07):**  In December, when I'm ordering seed, I'm actually pre-visualizing my display at the farmer's  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:15):**  market, for example, or the families I know I'm going to be making boxes for, or the chef  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:20):**  that I'm going to be serving.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:24):**  And so, yeah, we are to some degree dependent on, because of our smaller scale, because  
**[0:46:34-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:34):**  of the products we grow, on a heavy emphasis on direct marketing and community involvement.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:43):**  And I do, while I used to wholesale when I was in California, I don't think there's anything  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:48):**  anymore that I load up on pallets and forklift onto trucks.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:55):**  That was a part of my life in the past, but it is no longer.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:01):**  Just quickly to deal with the diversity as well in reducing costs is what I've spoke  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:07):**  about first, the different entity structures that the real estate is held by one entity.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:11):**  Then there's the nursery, the consultant, the farm as separate entities.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:17):**  Farm then doesn't have to pay for everything.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:21):**  It only has to pay for the farm expenses and the rent that it pays to the real estate holding  
**[0:47:25-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:25):**  entity.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:26):**  The nursery pays its expenses and the rent that it pays in real estate holding entity.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:30):**  So its costs, its fixed costs are reduced as well.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:35):**  All right, thanks again to the two panelists, Mark Shepherd and Michael Ableman, who are  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:40):**  both working tirelessly to create a healthier and more resilient farming culture around

**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:45):**  I highly recommend that you check out their work.

**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:47:56):**  And a special thanks to the team at Climate Farmers for organizing the event and to all  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:00):**  the wonderful people who showed up and participated in the chat.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:04):**  Now as great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:07):**  we covered in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and  
**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:12):**  viewpoints out there.

**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:35):**  more junk, I founded these channels purely for knowledge, skill, and story exchange between

**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:43):**  Now this week's question that we'll be discussing on the forum is, how can you manage the whole  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:47):**  ecology of your farm, or even your backyard or your home, to save you money?  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:53):**  At the end of the day, a farm is still a business and if you're not making money, you won't  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:57):**  be in business for very long.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:48:59):**  Now don't forget that you can also help to guide the panel discussions that I've got  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:49:03):**  planned for the future by suggesting topics and guests on the Discord forum too.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:49:08):**  Now that's our show for the week, until next time, keep taking those little steps every  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:49:12):**  day towards a regenerative future, and I'll be right by your side along the way.

**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:01:10):**  Today, we're going to start another two-part session focusing on the management of woody  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:01:16):**  perennials, specifically the practice of coppicing.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:01:20):**  Now in order to get a better understanding of this ancient woodland management system,  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:01:24):**  I reached out to Mark Krawcheck, the author of the new book, Coppice Agroforestry, Tending

**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:01:40):**  design, agroforestry, natural building, traditional woodworking, and small-scale forestry.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:01:46):**  He owns and operates Keyline Vermont LLC, providing farmers, homeowners, and homesteaders

**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:01:56):**  He and his wife also manage Valley Clayplain Forest Farm, which is 52 acres of field and  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:02):**  forest in New Haven, Vermont.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:05):**  Now despite the focus on coppice agroforestry systems that this conversation will revolve  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:10):**  around, Mark and I also go into a wide array of other topics, including the long history  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:15):**  of forest management in indigenous cultures around the world, understanding invasive species,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:21):**  woodland products and small craft economies, fire mitigation strategies, and a whole lot  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:27):**  more.

**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:32):**  it's not too much of a marathon to get through all in one go.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:36):**  And another bonus that comes along with this episode is that thanks to New Society, the  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:40):**  publishers of this book, I'll be offering a free volume of Coppice Agroforestry to listeners  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:46):**  of this show.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:47):**  So be sure to stay tuned to the end of this episode where I'll let you know how you can  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:51):**  win your very own copy.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:54):**  Now with all of that out of the way, I will hand things over to Mark Krawczyk.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:02:58):**  Mark, let's take it from the beginning.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:02):**  I am really interested in knowing how you first gained interest in forestry management,  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:08):**  Coppice Agroforestry and working in woodlands in general.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:13):**  What was your entry into all of this?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:16):**  Like many of us, it was not a linear path by any stretch.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:19):**  So I grew up in the suburbs outside Milwaukee, Wisconsin and had a very wholesome and full  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:26):**  and loving upbringing.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:28):**  But I wasn't really thinking more holistically about my life and the impacts on people in  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:34):**  places around the world.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:36):**  I wasn't really at all pondering what it took for me to just sustain my day to day life  
**[0:03:43-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:43):**  and had no practical skills for the most part that would enable me to be more resilient  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:51):**  in meeting those needs on my own.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:03:52):**  So I went to college in Vermont and got introduced to the field of environmental studies through  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:00):**  a few friends that were taking courses.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:02):**  And it was largely like the litany of the ways humans are undermining our life support  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:07):**  systems that they kind of started the program off with.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:11):**  And it was very disempowering for a lot of my classmates.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:16):**  But for me, it was very exciting to realize how much opportunity there was to just do  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:21):**  better.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:22):**  So I was really lucky because it was a fairly interdisciplinary, holistic program.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:30):**  And there were classes like living self-sufficiently.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:33):**  And there was actually a permaculture class.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:35):**  This is back in the late 90s.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:37):**  Holistic management, which I missed by one of the professors there who brought in a lot  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:42):**  of more ecological thinking to the way he taught plant and soil sciences.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:49):**  So essentially, I got introduced to the back to the land movement and this idea of reskilling.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:04:55):**  And I'm kind of chronicling my brief path in permaculture, which is what ultimately  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:00):**  led me to some of these other facets of that.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:06):**  But I got to spend some time in a few different intentional communities, Auroville in Southeast  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:10):**  India being one that was very formative for me in my kind of late teens.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:16):**  And that's where I started to learn about this idea of just using design as a tool to  
**[0:05:20-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:20):**  create the future that we want and to be beneficial forces in our landscapes and communities.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:29):**  So from there, it was like, OK, here's all these things I want to learn, all these skills  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:33):**  I'd love to have.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:34):**  And that brought me along a path of agroforestry.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:38):**  I spent a few years apprenticing and interning with different people.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:41):**  And so that also kind of really helped connect me with some of these other opportunities  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:45):**  and skill sets.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:48):**  And that was around 2001 when I first went on that journey.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:52):**  It was right around then that I encountered Ben Law's The Woodland Way book.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:05:56):**  And so I was kind of on this path bouncing from mentor to mentor.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:02):**  And there was just something about that book that really captivated me.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:05):**  And I'd been interested in learning some woodworking skills, had very minimal experience working  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:10):**  with wood in any way.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:13):**  And I was just really fascinated by the narrative that he described and the way that his life  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:20):**  and livelihood just were really interwoven within the management of his woods.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:25):**  And I wrote him a letter and asked if he took apprentices, and he did.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:29):**  So I think it was the fall of 2002, I went out there and spent six months working with  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:34):**  him.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:35):**  And that just totally expanded my worldview in terms of the opportunities for engaging  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:41):**  with woody plants and then ways to add value.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:46):**  The narrative keeps going, but that was my gateway into coppicing.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:51):**  And then maybe to just kind of cap that off, then I returned very rejuvenated with all  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:06:56):**  of this information and this vision and this experience and sort of anticipated this, but  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:02):**  realized that there was almost no corollary or companions that I could connect with that  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:08):**  kind of understood that or examples that I could learn from.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:12):**  And it was kind of early in my career, so I didn't have the confidence to go out and  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:16):**  start designing or implementing some of these things yet for people as a consultant.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:22):**  So that was how I got my feet wet.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:26):**  And then it's been 20 years of learning and practice since.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:30):**  And in that practice, you've got your own piece of land there in Vermont.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:33):**  How has this learning journey that you just described informed the way that you've started  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:38):**  to design and develop that place?  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:41):**  It's the foundation.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:42):**  It's basically everything.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:44):**  I would say one of my favorite permaculture principles is that design is imagination and  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:49):**  information intensive.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:50):**  And being able to spend time with people who'd been able to kind of live out their vision  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:07:56):**  and dreams, make lots of mistakes and have successes in different climates and contexts,  
**[0:08:03-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:03):**  being able to land in a place where my goal was to set roots, that really helped me kind  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:12):**  of think about the long game, be a bit more strategic about how I approach things.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:19):**  So I actually moved back to Vermont after traveling for about three or four years doing  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:26):**  these kind of work trade apprenticeship arrangements.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:30):**  And my vision was within like a year or two.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:33):**  I was going to find a piece of land, start homesteading.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:36):**  I wanted to build my own house.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:37):**  I wanted to do it like, you know, for $50,000, all of it, everything by the land, septic,  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:43):**  all of it, and realized that was very unrealistic.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:46):**  And I also wanted to make sure that the place I landed was the right spot.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:50):**  And it took me eight years before I actually decided that this was the right place.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:55):**  And that was 10 years ago now.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:08:56):**  So I've been on this property 10 years.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:00):**  And so I would say that like all that experience is just kind of baked into both the kind of  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:06):**  long-term planning and then like the day-to-day activities for sure.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:09):**  Nice.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:10):**  Well, I think if we go any further, we should start with a proper definition about what  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:16):**  it means to coppice as an action or what coppicing is and how it's different from, let's say,  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:21):**  palarding or even pruning.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:23):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:24):**  I, well, I liked that you brought pruning in because I feel like that's a good place  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:28):**  to start.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:29):**  When you're doing things, it's like your definition might shift depending on the audience.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:32):**  So we've got a pretty high caliber audience here, I imagine, in terms of their general  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:38):**  familiarity.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:39):**  But I feel like a great place to start is it's the most intensive way you could possibly  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:43):**  prune a plant because essentially you've cut it to the ground.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:47):**  Coppicing really only can be done with woody plants.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:51):**  So we're kind of limiting our palette of plants to trees and shrubs.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:09:54):**  I've had people ask if my coppicing, my salad greens, when I cut them and they come back.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:00):**  Well, no, because, yeah, but you kind of, it's the same idea.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:03):**  It's the idea, it's the cut and come again idea.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:06):**  And it's all based on the resilience of the root system and a bank of dormant buds that  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:16):**  enable the plant to regenerate after cutting.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:19):**  And so I would say coppicing in my mind is an intentional act, like sprouting is something,  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:25):**  re-sprouting is something that happens to plants when they get damaged out in nature.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:30):**  Windstorm happens and the trunk snaps off and it re-sprouts or wildlife browse on a  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:36):**  young seedling and it sprouts.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:38):**  I mean, to a degree that is coppicing, but to me, it feels like there's a human element  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:42):**  that that's brought into it that makes the act actually coppicing.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:48):**  And so I'd say it's the deliberate management of woody plants for the resultant sprouts  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:54):**  that emerge after cutting, after harvest.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:10:59):**  And then there's tons of little like caveats that can follow that up.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:02):**  So it would be like normally done during dormancy.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:05):**  So where I live, I always talk about winter being the period, but perhaps where you are,  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:10):**  it's more about the rainy versus the dry season.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:13):**  It's ideally during the period outside of active growth, when a lot of the energy is  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:18):**  in the roots, the leaf litter has already been deposited on the forest floor.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:23):**  You're going to give the plant the entire season to regenerate after it's cut.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:28):**  And then the other caveat that I'll just throw out there would be, well, two more.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:32):**  One would be not all woody plants will sprout.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:36):**  And again, just to be clear on terminology, woody plants, meaning plants that make wood,  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:42):**  and that includes trees, shrubs, and woody vines.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:47):**  For the most part, we don't really think about woody vines as being something you coppice,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:51):**  although you certainly could.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:54):**  Then within that woody plant realm, we've got the conifers and the broadleaf species  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:11:58):**  or evergreens and deciduous.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:01):**  And very few conifers will coppice in the true sense.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:05):**  There's exceptions where I live, the pitch pine is one in the American Southwest.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:10):**  I think it's the single leaf pinion pine.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:13):**  And there's a couple others, maybe it's the one seeded juniper and the coastal redwood,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:18):**  the California redwood is an amazing example of a conifer that will coppice up to, you  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:25):**  know, add up to 2000 years age.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:29):**  But for the most part, most broadleaf species will sprout when you cut them.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:34):**  And then there's some exceptions where it looks like perhaps if you leave some whorls  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:38):**  of branches, most conifers will sprout too.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:41):**  Is it coppicing?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:42):**  Not exactly, but kind of.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:44):**  And then the last thing I would just say to kind of round out the definition would be  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:50):**  that the rotation and the products are really key to the management.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:55):**  And so you're going to give the plant a certain number of years to regenerate before you cut  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:12:59):**  it again.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:00):**  And that cycle could range anywhere from just one season for something like basket willow  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:04):**  to up to 30, 40, or maybe even 50 years for some of the slower growing hardwood species.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:12):**  But not all species will coppice after that long a rotation.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:16):**  So long definition, perhaps, but involve a little bit explanation there.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:21):**  And quickly, let's go over pollarding, because that is one that is often talked about in  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:26):**  the same conversation as coppicing as a way to manage woody plants for cut and come again.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:31):**  What's the key difference there?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:34):**  So and forgive me, I often say pollarding.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:36):**  I think the word is properly pronounced pollarding.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:39):**  But for some reason, it doesn't roll off my tongue.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:41):**  So I'm going to say pollarding probably.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:44):**  And I'm not correcting you because I think I'm wrong.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:47):**  But but tomato tomato.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:49):**  I started saying it that way too.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:50):**  And then it's actually from people from the UK that that I kept hearing them say this.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:55):**  I'm like, what?  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:56):**  The words probably from there.  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:58):**  Maybe I'll go with that.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:13:59):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:00):**  I usually say pollarding as well.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:02):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:03):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:04):**  And, you know, I'm probably wrong, but I feel okay about it.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:09):**  So the way that that we're kind of contextualizing all of these practices that I think like if  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:17):**  we thought of it as like an outline, the overall heading, which was a term that emerged for  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:20):**  Dave Jackie and myself as we were trying to think about how to organize these different  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:25):**  practices is the idea of re-sprout silviculture, silviculture being the management and cultivation  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:31):**  of trees, forestry, essentially.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:35):**  And the idea that differentiates these practices, coppicing, pollarding, shredding, hedging,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:41):**  perhaps stump culture for Christmas trees is that instead of relying on seed to regenerate  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:50):**  a forest stand or to replace a tree after it's cut, we can just kind of leverage that  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:14:54):**  sprouting capability in the plant by bringing intention to how and when we do it.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:02):**  So I would say that coppicing, pollarding, like again, I said, shredding, hedgeling,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:07):**  those would all kind of fit within that basket of re-sprout silviculture.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:11):**  And maybe people don't like that term necessarily, but it just, for me, it kind of, it becomes  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:15):**  kind of the umbrella under which all those things lie.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:18):**  And so I found pollarding to be a very nebulous concept in a lot of ways as I was really trying  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:26):**  to explore it.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:27):**  When I apprenticed with Ben Law, he didn't really do much of that because he was really  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:30):**  focused more on whole wood production.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:33):**  And it's not really an optimal strategy if you're looking to generate poles for fence  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:39):**  posts or craft material, not necessarily craft materials, but the difference mainly being  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:44):**  that instead of cutting a tree at ground level, when you coppice, when you pollard, you were  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:48):**  doing that like out in the canopy of the tree.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:52):**  And so often what this involves is some pretty strategic training of the plant during its  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:15:59):**  early growth, like by the, from maybe the age of like five to 15, or maybe even beyond  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:05):**  that, you're really strategically trying to think about where are these knobs or these  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:10):**  bowls, these points of origin kind of, so when we talk about coppicing the stump of  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:16):**  the tree in England, they call it the stool.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:20):**  So if I use the term stool, that's like a single tree that's been coppiced.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:23):**  It's the stump that, you know, the sprouts originate from.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:27):**  It's almost like with a pollard, you have all these stools that are kind of out in space.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:32):**  Main reasons for that would be that you don't have to worry about wildlife or livestock  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:37):**  browsing the sprouts when they emerge, cause they're off the ground.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:41):**  And then secondly, it gives you a chance to have a little bit more kind of three-dimensional  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:45):**  architecture to your, your agriculture.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:47):**  So you could be grazing livestock in the understory while you're still providing shade, all the  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:16:54):**  ecosystem services trees create, and you're generating some either fodder or wood product.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:01):**  And so essentially you're going to have probably often multiple points of, of growth.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:08):**  Again that kind of function, like the coppice stool that you, you repeatedly cut back to,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:12):**  but it takes some strategy to get to the point where the tree has been trained to that architecture.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:18):**  It's in some ways similar to training a fruit tree to form.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:22):**  And then theoretically you kind of lock that architecture in place by repeatedly cutting  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:26):**  back to those points of growth.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:28):**  Right.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:30):**  And then the other thing that I most often see around here, they do it a lot, especially  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:33):**  with mulberry trees and coppice is something that I've just started to see more and more  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:38):**  of as I've learned to look for it.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:40):**  And the areas where it used to be practiced, it's really cool to get a spectrum of how  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:45):**  those different management styles fit within this idea of cut and come again, a silviculture.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:51):**  All right.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:52):**  So maybe one, one thing I'll just pass in real quick is just to say that ultimately  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:17:56):**  what that comes back to is the severity of disturbance.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:00):**  So it's like, you could be then theoretically, you could be like pruning just out on the  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:04):**  periphery of the plant, which I think is what they do with tea, like the tea plant is that,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:10):**  you know, training harvest right out, you know, at the twig tips, you bring it back  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:14):**  in a little bit more and maybe it's a less severe form of power and you could lop off  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:18):**  a tree at six feet and have just a single kind of lollipop Pollard or you cut it all  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:24):**  the way to the ground.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:25):**  And so it's really about like, how extreme is that, that disturbance and where is it  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:30):**  located?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:31):**  Right.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:33):**  Well said.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:34):**  So we've looked into your journey into these different woodland practices, as well as giving  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:38):**  a clear definition about these different terms that we're talking about.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:42):**  Let's dig now into the cultural history of compassing, because this goes way back and  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:47):**  it's just something that I've started to look into like the last one, two years, but I know  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:52):**  that I've only scratched the surface.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:53):**  So give me a little overview about the history of this type of silvicultural management.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:18:59):**  Yes.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:00):**  And, and I will just begin with the caveat that I feel like I've only begun to scratch  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:04):**  the surface.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:05):**  And that's, there's a number of reasons why that is.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:07):**  One is because with the exception of, of, of passable Spanish capability, I'm really  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:14):**  limited to English language resources.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:17):**  And so that automatically starts to kind of narrow the focus and breadth of the research  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:22):**  that went into this book.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:25):**  But I think it's probably safe to say that on every inhabited continent, humans would  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:29):**  have leveraged the sprouting capabilities of woody plants to meet their needs.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:36):**  I don't know of evidence of that everywhere in the book.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:39):**  The first chapter is dedicated to the history of the practices of resprout silviculture.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:45):**  And there's a little bit on North America and then a bigger chunk on Europe, much of  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:50):**  which is kind of grounded, rooted in the history of the UK.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:19:55):**  In my research, the earliest evidence that archeologists have traced to this practice  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:00):**  dates back about 8,000 years ago.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:04):**  And both of these sites are located along kind of coastal waterways.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:09):**  It's modern Dublin and then part of Denmark, I believe.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:15):**  And what they discovered was a network of, of wattle weirs and wattle, w-a-t-t-l-e wattle  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:23):**  describes a woven framework of sticks.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:25):**  People might be familiar with wattle and daub as a wall creation technique or wattle fencing.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:31):**  So you have uprights with weavers in between.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:33):**  It was often done with hazel, ubiquitous throughout history as a way to both enclose livestock,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:39):**  but then also create, you know, partitions between fields or garden walls.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:44):**  And then again, you know, walls often in timber frame buildings.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:47):**  And so, you know, wood doesn't last in the archeological record unless it's somehow preserved.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:20:54):**  And so that's why it seems that most of these sites tend to be along some type of waterway.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:01):**  So kind of buried in the, in the, you know, the, the soil or sand along these shorelines,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:08):**  they found this extensive network of woven fishing weirs.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:14):**  And, and I don't fully understand the design of these, but I think essentially they were  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:20):**  acting like big funnels that when the tide was high, the eels or fish would be kind of  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:25):**  funneled into pools that would have been, they'd be kind of contained within.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:31):**  And then as the tide receded, they'd just be able to go and collect, you know, whatever  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:36):**  had had made their way in and weren't able to get back out.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:39):**  And why they believe this is evidence of coppice is because we're talking hundreds of thousands  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:45):**  of stems that are, you know, very consistent in their diameter that are really straight,  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:52):**  very minimal side branching, because it takes, you know, hundreds or thousands of shoots  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:56):**  to do something like this on that scale.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:21:58):**  And if you look at wild plants in nature that haven't been managed or disturbed in this  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:05):**  sort of way, it's very likely that you're going to get irregular growth, that it's not  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:11):**  perfectly straight, even though most, even most coppice shoots aren't going to be perfectly  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:15):**  straight, but, you know, really nice and, and straight, where they're going to have  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:19):**  side shoots or branches.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:20):**  And so when we, when we coppice a plant, what tends to happen is we get this flush of new  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:25):**  growth and these sprouts that are, you know, six, eight, 10 feet tall in the first season,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:31):**  very minimal branches, often unblemished, very little damage from insects or other pests.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:38):**  So just the sheer volume of materials and the uniformity of those materials suggests  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:43):**  that they had some systematized way of procuring these materials.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:49):**  And even that might be a bit of a stretch.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:51):**  It's like, was it management or was it, you know, this kind of just coincidental tending?  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:22:58):**  Were they intentionally, did they have the compartment sort of rotational system or was  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:03):**  it something else?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:05):**  You would tend to think that they would have, you know, kind of engineered a system over  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:09):**  time, but that isn't really described.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:13):**  But so we see that as one like key example of the earliest origins of coppice.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:18):**  Another really fascinating story originates in the Somerset levels, which is this kind  
**[0:23:25-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:25):**  of intertidal zone along the Southwestern shores of the UK.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:35):**  There were some really early human settlements in this area and there were a number of hills  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:40):**  that would occasionally become islands as the, you know, spring rains would inundate  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:46):**  the lowlands in between.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:48):**  And these people had developed a network of tracks of walkways that connected these little  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:54):**  hilltop settlements over time.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:56):**  And again, those were preserved in the peat.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:23:59):**  And so that essentially, again, points to some intentional partnership with woody plants  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:07):**  to create materials that were perfectly suited to their technology and tools at the time.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:12):**  I think, should I keep going or I don't want to get too deep into the weeds here.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:15):**  Oh man, please go.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:16):**  Like all this stuff, I'm right there with you.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:18):**  This stuff's fascinating.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:19):**  So I think where I was just going to go with that is that if we step back and think about  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:24):**  it, because we're talking in some cases like the late stone age, when we look at the origins  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:28):**  of these practices, meaning that people were using stone tools and your capability, like  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:34):**  where we live in this world now where it's not a thing to go and pick up a handsaw from  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:40):**  the hardware store.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:42):**  People can bring a mobile sawmill to your site.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:44):**  You know, you have chainsaws, we have tractors and forwarders and pickup trucks and all these  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:49):**  very sophisticated technological tools to harvest, process and transport wood products.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:24:56):**  But you know, bring yourself back six, seven, 8,000 years ago, or even a thousand years  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:01):**  ago, and much of that technology didn't even exist.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:04):**  Even the saw is a relatively modern invention.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:08):**  So the ability to harvest and process wood was much different for our ancestors.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:13):**  And so small diameter materials would be much more, have much greater utility for most of  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:20):**  us, the ability to make lumber and harvest trees and transport them in order to convert  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:26):**  them to lumber requires a lot of sophistication.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:29):**  And so throughout much of human history, the desire for pole wood was much greater than  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:34):**  the need for timber.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:35):**  So that's, that's a big theme in all of this.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:38):**  It's just that these, the, we tend to call like pole wood materials that are maybe in  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:44):**  the three to eight or 10 inch range, maybe three to eight inch diameter range.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:49):**  And then anything smaller than that often be considered like a rod.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:54):**  So a lot of weavers and things like that.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:25:56):**  So I like to talk about the economy of pole wood as being really critical to the relevance  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:03):**  of coppice today, because it was essential to, you know, this, these historical examples,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:09):**  but for a lot of us, we don't understand how those materials necessarily kind of fit our  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:15):**  context.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:16):**  And when we find opportunities to use pole wood and rods, suddenly coppicing becomes  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:20):**  a whole lot more valuable to us.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:23):**  And then going into, like you said, the context of the larger importance of pole wood during  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:29):**  those times and the culture that formed out of these types of rotations and this type  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:36):**  of practice of woodland management.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:37):**  Can you go into how this affected people's lifestyles and even the communities that were  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:43):**  centered around this type of production?  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:45):**  Yes, I am.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:46):**  I'm a novice at having like a true deep understanding of kind of the sociopolitical networks and  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:54):**  organizations of people through, you know, prehistory into the Middle Ages and such.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:26:59):**  But I think it was really pivotal in a lot of ways to how we organized ourselves, how  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:06):**  we met our needs.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:08):**  So my understanding is because as we kind of transition from this, you know, more kind  
**[0:27:13-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:13):**  of hunter gatherer or pastoralist or horticulturalist, because I didn't really talk too much about  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:21):**  the indigenous North American history.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:24):**  Maybe if there's a window, I can mention a few little bits about that, too.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:28):**  But there are a number of different ways that humans have met their needs through interaction  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:32):**  with landscape.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:34):**  But we kind of shifted from this sort of subsistence economy in these kind of prehistory and like  
**[0:27:39-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:39):**  kind of, you know, Iron Age, Bronze Age settlements into this more kind of organized market, emerging  
**[0:27:48-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:48):**  market economy type, you know, social and financial networks where most people did not  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:57):**  own property.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:27:59):**  It was only in the case of like the feudal system in the UK, it was, you know, the king  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:04):**  or the landlord who actually held rights to the landscape.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:10):**  And obviously, though, it was essential that the commoners or the villagers would be able  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:15):**  to meet their fundamental needs.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:17):**  And so kind of granted, just as a birthright for most people was access to a commons of  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:23):**  some sort.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:24):**  And that may be a wooded commons where you could harvest fuel wood, because it's easy  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:27):**  to forget today.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:30):**  But you know, I tend to think about fuel always from a heating point of view, but it also  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:35):**  was essential for daily cooking.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:37):**  And so fuel wood, it was something that's been essential all year long for people all  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:43):**  over the world where they don't have access to electricity or, you know, some type of  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:47):**  fossil fuel.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:49):**  So there was that element of it, just like meeting fundamental needs with fuel wood,  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:28:54):**  there also might be, you know, craft or income livelihood generating opportunities from harvesting  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:00):**  wood products.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:01):**  And then that coupled with the needs of livestock for pasture and grazing.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:06):**  So some of these systems that began to express themselves on the landscape, like the wood  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:12):**  pasture or the wooded common, you know, that we tend to call it like silvopasture today,  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:17):**  that the term wood pasture in England describes this kind of two layer system with grazing  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:22):**  animals underneath, and then a canopy of often pollarded trees, because they were trying  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:26):**  to, you know, make use of every possible little niche in those systems.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:32):**  And what often occurred was that the landlord was actually the owner of the pollard, the  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:40):**  tree itself, the villagers may have access to the sprouts.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:45):**  Some of these things got, you know, very complex, and they were kind of woven within each little  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:49):**  network.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:51):**  And then they would, the commoners or villagers would also be able to graze their animals  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:55):**  in the understory and forage and collect.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:29:57):**  But a lot of these practices were kind of baked into just the ways people organized  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:03):**  one another.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:04):**  Similarly, another really common practice through history, kind of the mainstay of forestry,  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:09):**  I think throughout much of Europe, you know, through the Middle Ages was the Coppice with  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:14):**  Standard system, which is essentially like a two layer Coppice system where you have  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:19):**  standard trees that were left uncut, allowed to grow to full diameter and harvested for  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:24):**  lumber at usually 70 to 120 or so years.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:29):**  They were usually chosen because they made some type of food stuff for livestock or wildlife.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:36):**  So often, you know, beech, chestnut, and oaks were the most common standard trees.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:43):**  And they would generally be at densities of maybe one to ten per acre.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:49):**  So when I think of like ten trees per acre, I'm thinking if they were in a perfect grid,  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:53):**  that'd be like about a 65 foot space between each tree, you know, if they were on center,  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:30:58):**  just to give some context for that.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:01):**  Also apologies to metric literate people.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:03):**  I can sometimes go there, but it's easier because the numbers are in my head in Imperial.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:08):**  But it's like 30 meters in between.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:11):**  One day we'll catch up.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:14):**  And so standard trees generally were the property of the landlord, but the commoners would have  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:22):**  had access to the Underwood or the Coppice sprouts.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:26):**  And so that was another kind of way that these overlaid rights were, you know, kind of nested  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:33):**  within this larger matrix of social structure.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:39):**  And so that Coppice wood was really kind of essential to people being able to meet their  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:44):**  needs, despite the fact that they really owned very little, if anything, they just had these  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:48):**  kind of, again, kind of birthrights to resources.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:53):**  For folks that want to dive into this in a bit more of a narrative way, there's a book  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:31:58):**  that came out a few years ago called Sproutlands.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:01):**  I believe it's William Bryant Logan.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:03):**  And he explores some of the stories that are also included in Coppice agroforestry, but  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:10):**  then also travels to other parts of the world where he gets into some of these practices  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:15):**  in Asia, in South America, I believe in Africa as well.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:20):**  And just paints a little bit more of a comprehensive image of how sprouts played pivotal roles  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:26):**  in the lives of humans around the world throughout history.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:31):**  And then maybe just contrasting European story a little bit with the limited information  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:35):**  I have about North America.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:39):**  And when I talk about North America, I'm really just talking about like the Western states,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:43):**  because there's a fantastic book called Tending the Wild by M. Cat Anderson, that is largely,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:49):**  you know, an ethnobotanical and anthropological look at the land use traditions of indigenous  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:56):**  Californians.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:32:57):**  And what we see there is this intimate relationship between people and landscape.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:03):**  And she describes these traditions as being one of the people that are horticultural or  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:09):**  horticulturalists, as opposed to the, you know, we often tend to see this interaction  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:14):**  with landscape as a binary thing.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:16):**  They're either hunter gatherers or they're pastoralists or, you know, nomadic.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:20):**  And in this case, the idea of the horticulturalist really speaks to this heightened level of  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:25):**  understanding and reciprocity in the relationship.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:28):**  It wasn't like there was a kind of just coincidental movement and migration of people.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:34):**  It was very intentional that people were sculpting the landscape and in turn their populations  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:39):**  were being shaped and sculpted by the landscape.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:42):**  And so the practices of, you know, sowing of intentional harvest of like of crops that  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:49):**  have, you know, tubers or corms or bulbs that could be become propagules for expanding those  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:54):**  plant populations.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:33:57):**  And especially the use of fire as a management tool to stimulate sprouting and also just  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:04):**  kind of create a diverse landscape were really essential to their life ways.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:11):**  And so it's kind of a different avenue in some ways to get to coppicing and also a very  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:16):**  different way of arranging themselves socially.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:22):**  But we see again that that practice is really essential.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:24):**  And for many people, it was because the first and foremost, in addition to fuel, but it  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:29):**  was the need for products to carry items in and store stuff.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:33):**  So the need for baskets has been really central to most cultures around the world.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:40):**  And we find varying forms of baskets.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:43):**  And I'd have to imagine almost anywhere that people have materials that they could weave  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:47):**  with.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:50):**  Coppicing is pretty much the best way to do it.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:52):**  And it's one of the few still relatively common examples of coppicing in the region where  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:34:59):**  I live.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:00):**  Because if you want to make baskets using, you know, woven kind of wicker techniques,  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:05):**  you can't get better materials than if you were to coppice the stools in order to do  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:11):**  that.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:12):**  It's like you're talking about the uniformity that comes with doing that and understanding  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:15):**  those rotations.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:16):**  And there's so much that you were talking about there that brought up some associations  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:21):**  and some recent learning I've had from my own travels and such, because I've lived in  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:25):**  communities like in Guatemala, where firewood is the primary fuel source for cooking as  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:30):**  well.

**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:36):**  techniques are really informed the landscape, especially in the in the mountains where I

**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:49):**  of like slash and burn agriculture, which generally has a very poor association for  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:53):**  how it is managed at the moment, but how it comes from maybe 40 to 100 year rotation in  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:35:59):**  tropical forests, where a single area within the forest was essentially reset, both with  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:05):**  the hardwoods that were managed for timber and for fuel, and also the food, the food  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:11):**  and the medicine sources that came from that as well, and maybe managed for a couple of  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:15):**  seasons with more intensive annual production, but at the same time planting the seeds for  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:22):**  the perennials that would later take over and managing them at each stage of their life  
**[0:36:26-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:26):**  in these very large area long term rotations that could only have influenced the culture  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:33):**  and the patterns of living that they had.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:36):**  And then also seeing since I've recently moved to Europe, how those are baked into the history  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:41):**  of the different autonomous communities that I've seen and started to learn about.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:45):**  Like, for example, where I am here in Catalunya, northeastern Spain, a lot of the traditions  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:52):**  and the history or the folklore of this area is tied into what we would consider like pagan  
**[0:36:58-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:36:58):**  originated ideas, which are all having to do with spirits and harvest cycles and rotations  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:09):**  in the ecosystem and the pattern of the forest, which is what this place really was for such  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:13):**  a long time.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:16):**  And yeah, just there's so many different connections.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:18):**  If you go far back enough, almost all cultures and world views originated with at least a  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:25):**  much closer, if not fundamental connection to woodlands, even if they were something  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:31):**  that might have been on the periphery, like they were early to agriculture or something.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:35):**  But many of them very much integrated.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:38):**  You think of, you know, druid traditions and cultures in the islands in the further north  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:43):**  or Celtic, as we have here in Spain as well.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:47):**  And even in the Mediterranean, especially with how closely things like grapes and olives  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:53):**  and almonds and these other food sources around these kind of more arid coastal areas have  
**[0:37:59-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:37:59):**  informed just the fabric of how people have lived here for two, three, four thousand years.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:06):**  It's so cool to see how this is actually connected with healthy integral management of the ecosystems,  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:14):**  mostly of which perennial and tree based ecologies were managed.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:19):**  It's something that I continually get excited about and keep going deeper as I see different  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:25):**  places around the world and the histories that have emerged into the cultures that we  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:29):**  have today.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:31):**  Now, you also alluded to talking a little bit more about how North American indigenous  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:37):**  peoples started or the little bit, you know, of their management techniques with compass  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:41):**  and forestry management.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:43):**  Do you want to talk about that because it works perfectly into the Segway about colonization  
**[0:38:49-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:49):**  and how and why compass management hasn't become more of a thing in modern culture?  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:38:58):**  Well, one thing I just wanted to pick up on, too, that I'm glad you brought up is just  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:03):**  kind of the corollary with the slash and burn agriculture, which, again, in my experience,  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:07):**  often felt that was spoken of in a disparaging way as something that was destructive to the  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:14):**  landscape and was inappropriate management or undermining ecological health.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:20):**  Whereas like one way that I've described just traditional copper systems in the kind of  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:25):**  rotational expression is very much like rotational grazing, where it's this like intentional,  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:31):**  targeted, intense disturbance with a long recovery period.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:36):**  And that theme there is all about like rejuvenating disturbance.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:39):**  The disturbance can be debilitating or disturbance can be like invigorating and health enriching.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:46):**  And that I think we tend even the idea of like a clear cut in forestry, you know, so  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:52):**  much of it's about context and scale and how we apply it with intention.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:39:58):**  And we see that kind of periodicity of management expressed in all of these different people's  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:04):**  ways of engagement.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:07):**  My knowledge of of these practices in North America, again, is really limited to the narratives  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:12):**  that Cat Anderson shares in Tending the Wild.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:15):**  I found little snippets of information in a few other books, partly because of my understanding  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:23):**  is partly it's because of the legacy of colonization and the impact that Europeans had on indigenous  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:29):**  populations out in the eastern parts of the continent, where populations were decimated  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:35):**  very early on.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:36):**  And and a lot of those traditions were basically kind of extinguished from the landscape.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:44):**  And so there wasn't this kind of cultural memory, nor was there really the literacy  
**[0:40:50-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:50):**  among colonists to recognize that this was actually there were sophisticated interaction,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:40:58):**  in landscape interaction that was happening when they walked through what they believed  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:01):**  was wilderness.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:02):**  And I already spoke a little bit about I kind of gave you what I have in a nutshell about  
**[0:41:08-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:08):**  the California traditions, which again, just to reiterate, was largely this kind of fluid  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:15):**  movement of people through landscape, tending wild plant populations, and tending is such  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:22):**  a great word, you know, because I think of it as as synonymous in some ways to management,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:27):**  but it also connotes this conversation or this reciprocity that's kind of embedded in  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:32):**  it management has a much more kind of heavy handed implication, whereas tending seems  
**[0:41:38-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:38):**  that there's care and and and and a conversation that's kind of built into that.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:46):**  But you know, fire being the primary tool, the most effective tool for for manipulating  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:52):**  landscapes or resetting succession.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:41:56):**  And so, as we see this kind of wave of colonization begin to like, make its way across the North  
**[0:42:02-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:02):**  American continent, both coupled with the fact that, again, there probably was very  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:08):**  little appreciation for the nuance of the practices that were that were, you know, key  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:14):**  to creating these landscapes.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:17):**  I have a hard time knowing fully if, if coppicing didn't really exist, or it just wasn't that  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:23):**  necessary as Europeans began to kind of make their mark on this landscape, because coppicing  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:29):**  happens whether you want it to or not, like for a lot of people, not unlike what you were  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:33):**  describing before, it's like, most of us have seen, you know, hundreds or thousands of copper  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:39):**  stools in our lifetime, because they're all over the place, they're on the edges of vacant  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:43):**  lots, or they're along railroad beds, or in parking lots and things like that.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:48):**  It just it happens, but people don't notice it.  
**[0:42:51-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:42:51):**  And so, the, the, the need to develop this kind of systematized, you know, more comprehensive  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:02):**  system was probably a lot less, because there was a lot of land clearance for agriculture.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:07):**  And there was abundant wood products for most people during those early days.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:11):**  And so, I think it's just that we kind of lost that those traditions of Europe, because  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:16):**  part, a big key to the migration of people from Europe to North America was resource  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:22):**  shortages.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:23):**  And so, you know, people stepped into this relative abundance.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:27):**  But it's interesting, because in some of the research I did, we, there's a guy from, I  
**[0:43:33-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:33):**  don't know if he was a forester, but his name is Mattoon, M-A-T-T-O-O-N.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:39):**  And he writes about chestnut coppice in the early 20th century in Connecticut.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:45):**  And so, it's like it was happening, but a lot of times they don't even really call it  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:49):**  coppice, you know, it's stump sprouts, or there's, there's other terms that might be  
**[0:43:53-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:53):**  used.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:54):**  So, it definitely was going on.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:43:56):**  It just wasn't, you know, this, this, you know, very formal compartment-based rotation  
**[0:44:03-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:03):**  system.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:04):**  And I think that coupled with the transformation and technology and tools, along with just  
**[0:44:11-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:11):**  the abundance of fossil energy that, you know, flooded the economies of that era, you know,  
**[0:44:19-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:19):**  the industrial era, it became a lot more practical to process larger diameter materials.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:27):**  And so, the desire for small diameter pole wood just started to fall out of favor.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:33):**  It's to the point where this day and age, it's like we grow shiitake mushrooms here  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:36):**  on our farm.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:37):**  And the materials I'm looking for, for most loggers, aren't even worth the time to harvest  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:43):**  them because they're so small.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:46):**  So there's just, we don't really have that lens anymore.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:49):**  Even what I usually like to cut for firewood is stuff most people wouldn't bother hauling  
**[0:44:53-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:53):**  out of the forest.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:44:54):**  So that, that kind of value shift along with the technology and energy, it seems to be  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:01):**  the key pieces that started to kind of bring the demise of those practices in a lot of  
**[0:45:05-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:05):**  ways.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:06):**  And the lack of that kind of cultural lineage and the passing on of tradition also played  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:12):**  into it.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:14):**  And then that coupled with, and this is true in many parts of Europe too, but there was  
**[0:45:17-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:17):**  kind of this period of neglect starting in kind of the post-World War II area that a  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:23):**  lot of forests had been cut or managed for, you know, generations.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:28):**  And for whatever reason, they saw very little interaction from, you know, the 1940s and  
**[0:45:35-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:35):**  early on.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:36):**  And so in my part of the world, most, many forested landscapes are densely overstocked  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:44):**  because they were probably clear cut 60, 80, a hundred years ago, and no one really ever  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:49):**  went in to do any sinning or, or, you know, timber stand improvement type management to,  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:45:56):**  you know, kind of better distribute the wood resource that exists in the stand.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:01):**  And so we're dealing with this kind of overstocked, very competitive community that over time  
**[0:46:08-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:08):**  will figure itself out, but we kind of see the results of just that neglect playing out  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:15):**  today.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:16):**  And the other big impact, which I'm going a little off script here, but is, I think  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:21):**  it's worth mentioning is that we're inheriting a legacy of high graded forests, meaning that  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:28):**  they say, taking the best and leaving the worst or take the best and leave the rest.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:34):**  And so, you know, over several generations, we've really started to undermine the genetic  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:38):**  base in our forests by leaving the lowest value species, the most, the ones that are  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:44):**  most susceptible to disease or the slowest growing and then harvesting the highest quality  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:48):**  stems.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:49):**  So there's a lot of rejuvenation and, and regeneration.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-1/#t=0:46:53):**  It's really essential to restoring the potential of a forested landscape here.

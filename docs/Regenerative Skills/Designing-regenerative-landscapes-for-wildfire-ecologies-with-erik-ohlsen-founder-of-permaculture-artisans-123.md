### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:40):**  New Society Publishers' books are so green you could eat them!  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:44):**  We print all our books in North America, never overseas, on 100% post-consumer recycled paper,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:50):**  we've been a carbon neutral company since 2006, our employees are shareholders, and  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:56):**  we are a certified B Corporation.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:00:59):**  At New Society, we care deeply about what we publish, but also about how we do business.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:05):**  Find out more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:09):**  Alright everybody, before I get started with today's episode, I wanted to let you know  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:13):**  about a new project that I've just launched.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:16):**  Now after years of highlighting and promoting the knowledge, wisdom, and projects of innovators  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:20):**  and leaders in regenerative living through this podcast, I've realized that this audio  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:24):**  format can only ever reach so many people.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:27):**  There are so many others out there who engage more with other forms of learning.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:31):**  That's why I've started the Abundant Edge YouTube channel.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:34):**  Now that I'm back on the road and visiting regenerative and sustainable projects in my  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:38):**  travels, I'll be profiling the people and organizations that are making a real impact  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:42):**  on their environments and their communities.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:45):**  My goal is to show as many people as I can reach that you don't have to have a lot  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:48):**  of money, access to a ton of resources, or have a fancy education under your belt to  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:53):**  make a real difference in this world and create change.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:01:56):**  My first mini-documentary highlights the unbelievable achievements of a small community called Quixa  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:01):**  Ya in the highlands of Guatemala.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:04):**  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:07):**  owner who kept the ecosystem under monoculture cultivation and exploited the local people  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:12):**  who worked for slave wages on the farm.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:15):**  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:19):**  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:22):**  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:27):**  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:31):**  it and create a better life for their families.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:34):**  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:38):**  a profound abundance which you'll see in the documentary.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:42):**  Now if you want to see the rest, you'll have to check it out for yourself.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:44):**  You can find it really easily just by typing in Abundant Edge into the YouTube search bar.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:49):**  And be sure to keep an eye out for more short films highlighting the projects that I visit  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:53):**  as I travel through Mexico and beyond.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:55):**  I'll also be releasing tutorials on everything from design theory to building and gardening  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:59):**  techniques in the upcoming months.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:01):**  I really hope that this will become a resource that, like the podcasts, helps to inspire  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:06):**  you to live your highest potential by living regeneratively.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:11):**  Alright today we're back with Eric Olson, founder of both Permaculture Artisans, one  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:15):**  of the preeminent ecological landscaping companies in the US, and the Permaculture Skills Center,  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:20):**  a vocational training school that offers advanced education in ecological design, landscaping,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:25):**  farming, and land stewardship.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:28):**  Eric is also the author of several books including The Forest of Fire, Activate Your Joy, and  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:33):**  most recently The Ecological Landscape Designer, an essential manual for anyone aspiring to  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:38):**  make a living in eco design.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:41):**  Now though it's long overdue, I spoke with Eric to get a better understanding of the  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:44):**  intensity of the wildfires that have dominated current events around this increasingly extended  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:50):**  fire season that affects more and more acreage especially in the western United States every  
**[0:03:55-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:55):**  year.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:56):**  Eric explains how fire can actually be a regenerative force for the ecology of many forests, and  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:01):**  how the indigenous people of the western United States have managed fires strategically for  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:05):**  thousands of years.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:07):**  We talk about how communities can work together to manage the risks of their ecosystems and  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:11):**  avoid the catastrophic damage that fires have caused in previous years.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:15):**  We also explore some of the wisdom and lessons that Eric has learned in more than 20 years  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:19):**  running his permaculture landscaping business, and the challenges of meeting clients' needs  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:24):**  while including the holistic health considerations of nature.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:28):**  Like many of the more seasoned and experienced professionals that I've had the pleasure  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:31):**  of speaking to on this show, Eric shies away from making specific recommendations for techniques  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:36):**  or designs, and rather encourages people to cultivate a deeper understanding of their  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:40):**  place and context before making assumptions about how to manage their land or even businesses.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:47):**  This is a great episode for people looking to better understand fire-prone ecologies,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:51):**  but also for people who enjoy the challenge of considering a deeper understanding of their  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:55):**  relationship to natural systems in general.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:58):**  So before I give it all away, I'll hand things over now to Eric.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:02):**  Hey Eric!  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:04):**  It's so great to be talking to you again!  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:05):**  How have you been?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:06):**  I've been great.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:07):**  Thanks so much for having me back on the show.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:09):**  Hey, it's my pleasure, and I'm also really glad that you recovered from your neck injury  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:13):**  recently.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:14):**  Yeah, that was a strange one, but here we are.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:18):**  Here we are.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:19):**  So rather than having you talk about your background the way we did last time, I'm  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:23):**  going to refer people back to that original episode where you explained a lot about how  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:26):**  you started out as an activist and then started to realize that you could be more effective  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:32):**  in the private sector.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:34):**  But let's talk today about some things that are very relevant to your place and time on  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:40):**  the coastal area of California, and that's the subject of fires.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:44):**  Especially in the last couple of years, they have kind of compounded based on some things  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:50):**  that have happened with drought and rain cycles.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:53):**  Can you give us a little bit of a context as to how we're dealing with fire landscapes  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:59):**  and how it's changed over the last couple of decades?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:02):**  Absolutely, and I'll just note that even right at this moment when I look to the north, normally  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:08):**  I have a view of the mountains and currently as of this morning, it's totally smoked in  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:14):**  from a fire that's happening in southern Oregon.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:17):**  So smoke travels a very long way, and this is becoming the norm here in California.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:25):**  We all have our respirator masks near and ready, a few times over the last couple of  
**[0:06:32-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:32):**  years I might go out to work and by the time I come home, it's smoke and it's ash and we're  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:40):**  stuck inside.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:42):**  In fact, even the school districts and my kids who are in middle school, we now have  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:50):**  school days that are closed, schools closed on smoke days, and schools are now preparing  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:56):**  each year to close extra days every year due to smoke.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:01):**  So this is becoming a normalized situation and it's really increased just in the last  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:08):**  few years, really since the major drought hit, which was about five years ago.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:13):**  We went into a major drought, which currently is not the current situation due to the heavy  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:20):**  rains we had this last winter.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:22):**  Most reservoirs and lakes are at capacity and snowpack is thick, but it's all exacerbated  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:30):**  by the changing in climate, the heating of the planet, the shifting of water temperature  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:36):**  in the ocean and the way that that affects wind currents, and these events are getting  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:41):**  more and more extreme.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:42):**  And they're also compounded by the fact that we have a boring beetle infestation in many  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:50):**  of our forests.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:51):**  So because of the drought, the boring beetle, they're the beetles that go in there and they  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:57):**  can basically kill the tree even just in one year.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:04):**  During the drought years, they spread very fast, they reproduce very quickly.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:09):**  So a lot of different aspects to what's kind of set up this crisis.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:16):**  And another part of the crisis and probably where it all began was when we shifted our  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:22):**  relationship with fire maybe about 100 years ago from a relationship that the native people  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:28):**  of these lands have always had, which is that fire is a regenerative tool to renew the land  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:35):**  versus what Western culture has been doing the last 100 years, which is suppressing fire.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:42):**  And what's happened is the forests have become congested, congested with dead and dying wood.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:52):**  The number of trees per acre has increased tenfold, hundredfold in some places.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:58):**  And this is what we call fuel load.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:00):**  And this fuel load, once it ignites, the fires burn quickly up into the canopy of the forest.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:07):**  And once the canopy erupts, we've got embers and firestorms.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:13):**  And we've seen the news over the last few years and we've seen the devastating effect  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:17):**  that has on communities.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:19):**  So this is the new normal in the West.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:22):**  And the beautiful aspect of this is that cities and counties and governments and the citizenry  
**[0:09:31-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:31):**  is waking up to not only the crisis, but the context that we've been talking about here.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:39):**  And there are some very promising new processes like here in my county, Sonoma County, we  
**[0:09:48-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:48):**  got hit by the big fire in 2017, the Tubbs fire, which burned over 5,000 structures and  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:56):**  had a devastating effect on our community.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:58):**  And now the county is, we're doing prescribed burns.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:02):**  I was down at my local park just the other day.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:05):**  There's sheep in there grazing on public lands right now to mitigate fuel load.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:11):**  So there's a lot of positive action being taken place from an ecological point of view  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:17):**  that hopefully will be the growing trend throughout all of our communities.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:21):**  And we can really kind of get to the next stage of managing these.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:26):**  That's really encouraging to hear.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:27):**  I know when I started to learn more about this after some of the devastating fires of  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:32):**  the previous years, a lot of the conclusions that I had read about, including through your  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:38):**  blog, were somewhat counterintuitive from what I might have guessed otherwise.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:42):**  Because the last one that you mentioned, it was the Tubbs fire?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:47):**  In 2017, came after the rain sort of returned after a drought period.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:53):**  And I thought that that was going to be more of a help in preventing large fires like this.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:59):**  But it caused a lot of underbrush growth very rapidly in an area that had previously been  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:07):**  sort of stunted because of the lack of moisture.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:10):**  And when the summer came back in, there was that much more, like you said, fuel load for  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:14):**  fires which had not been managed sort of periodically and in a controlled fashion.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:21):**  And these types of things kind of start to accumulate again.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:25):**  And also the introduction of non-native species, specifically, I believe it's eucalyptus trees,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:32):**  and how much those can add to large fires.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:37):**  Can you talk about some of these other things that are perhaps, I guess, non-intuitive or  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:43):**  could be contradictory to most people's thinking about how fires come about and perhaps are  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:48):**  managed?  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:49):**  Sure.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:50):**  I mean, the first point there about the increase in underbrush relative to heavy rains, that  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:58):**  was a big issue.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:01):**  And it's kind of this perfect storm that happens.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:05):**  And one of my native friends, Redbird, taught me a lot about this after the Tubbs fire.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:12):**  A lot about how when you have that heavy winter with a lot of spring growth, and then you  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:21):**  have a hot summer, and then you get what we might call the Diablo winds or in Southern  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:27):**  California they might call them the Santa Ana winds, which are an eastern wind that  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:33):**  is pulling warm, dry air from inland areas and blowing across the land, blowing this  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:41):**  hot air, almost like a blow dryer.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:43):**  That is this combination that creates these firestorms.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:46):**  And one of the things that Redbird taught me was that actually the native communities  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:51):**  here in this area literally have a word for that wind.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:56):**  And that word has been passed down generation after generation for 10,000 years.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:03):**  And they actually have a name for each one of these fires.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:07):**  I think this is an important point that I think a lot of folks don't realize is that  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:12):**  a lot of the fire zones where these big fires are happening, while the scale and speed and  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:20):**  devastation is unprecedented because of the fuel load and human development and fire suppression  
**[0:13:27-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:27):**  and all these things, the fires themselves, the locations and the fact that they are erupting  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:36):**  is not a new precedent at all.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:38):**  In fact, native people have been tracking these fires for 10,000 years to the point  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:42):**  they actually have names for these fires.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:45):**  So one of the illusions we have to dispel is that one, that we can stop the fire from  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:52):**  coming.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:53):**  We just need to let go of that notion 100% complete.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:56):**  We're not going to stop fire from coming into a ecological system that has evolved with  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:04):**  fire for tens of thousands of years.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:06):**  Those are natural phenomenons, just like a geyser would be a natural phenomenon.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:11):**  And so it's just about the time intervals of understanding when these megafires, what's  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:17):**  the history?  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:18):**  And that's where we need to look to our native communities to learn and understand what the  
**[0:14:23-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:23):**  history of these fires are beyond our Western records and back into those deeper land-based  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:33):**  knowledge of these fires.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:34):**  So for one, we can't stop the fires from coming, but they are unprecedentedly huge and devastating  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:39):**  because of the context.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:43):**  And we want to be aware of the buildup of fuel load.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:49):**  We want to be aware of the patterns of climate so that we can really predict when an area  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:56):**  is going to go up in flames.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:57):**  And it's actually not as hard as it sounds.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:00):**  If we take the time to learn the story of place and we take the time to understand a  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:06):**  bit more about the role that fire has in the community.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:11):**  And another piece that I think is kind of paradoxical or that we may not understand  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:17):**  is that after a fire comes through, that doesn't actually mean that that area that was burned  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:23):**  is now safe from a fire again.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:26):**  In fact, we're noticing in some areas after the Tubbs fire in Santa Rosa that some of  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:33):**  those areas are growing up very, very thick with Scotch Broom, which is an invasive opportunistic  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:40):**  plant in our area, and other plants that will go up in flames pretty quickly, very flashy  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:46):**  fuel loads.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:47):**  And they're growing in very thick and very congested.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:50):**  And when I consult with the fire ecologists about this, they say, yeah, really we should  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:55):**  be prescribed burning those zones the next year after the first big wildfire.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:01):**  So as we start to unpack what it means to be in a relationship with fire and to understand  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:06):**  this, first and foremost is that we need fire in these ecologies.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:13):**  And so we need to sort of embrace its role and then control this intensity by using prescribed  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:23):**  burn strategies to burn these areas at the right time of year in a controlled manner  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:30):**  that will help manage these fuels and help that regrowth, help manage that regrowth in  
**[0:16:37-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:37):**  such a way that we're not just allowing another massive fuel load growth to happen.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:47):**  And one more example, we're kind of waiting for an area near where I live, the hills of  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:53):**  Casa Deiro, sort of like that's due to burn.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:57):**  There was a big fire there in 1978 or 79 that burned those ridges.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:03):**  When you go into those, when you go look at that forest now, it's highly congested with  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:08):**  tannic, a lot of dying tannic, and it's just ripe for burning.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:13):**  And part of the issue there is that all that sprouted up really dense and thick after that  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:18):**  last big fire.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:20):**  So these aren't things that are going to go away, and it's really a year by year management.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:26):**  It's not like we can just wait 10 years to look at these systems again.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:31):**  So we really have to incorporate into how we manage our landscapes, how we develop,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:38):**  how we build our communities.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:40):**  Fire has to have a place inside if we want to live in these ecologies.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:46):**  Let's go back to something that you said a minute ago about how fires can be managed  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:50):**  for the regeneration of landscapes and how right after one of these burns occurs, right  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:56):**  now there are opportunistic or some would call them invasive species originally from  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:01):**  other parts of the world that are finding niches in these damaged or disturbed ecosystem  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:07):**  and kind of running amuck.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:10):**  How can those either be leveraged for something positive or replaced by something further  
**[0:18:16-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:16):**  along in the succession to restore a healthy ecosystem over the ashes of the disturbed  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:24):**  landscape?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:25):**  So the first thing that we need to realize is that these fires and the vegetative growth  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:33):**  that follows them is going to be different from ridge to ridge and valley to valley.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:39):**  So it makes it more complex and it causes us to become real people of the land because  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:47):**  there really is not one prescription that is, you know, there's not a one size fits  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:53):**  all approach.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:54):**  And so we really have to take the time to read each ridge and each valley to understand  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:00):**  what's going to be the appropriate response to that particular zone.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:04):**  Like some areas have the Scotch broom growing up thick and other areas are just full of  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:08):**  native bunch grasses of wildflowers and the beauty of what the fire has brought to those  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:14):**  areas is really apparent.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:18):**  So first off, let's just remember that one of the roles that fire, fires are what we  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:23):**  might call a regenerative disturbance.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:26):**  It's actually one of the great nutrient cyclers of the ecosystem.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:30):**  When a fire rolls through it changes the pH.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:35):**  It produces a lot of potassium, potash, so it's one of the ways that we actually renew  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:39):**  potassium in the environment.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:42):**  It takes out a lot of dead and diseased species.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:46):**  So kind of cleans the slate from a disease point of view.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:53):**  And many of the species, the native species, actually need fire to grow.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:59):**  Many seeds need the heat in order to sprout.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:04):**  So a lot of the land has evolved with fire and when the fire comes through these beautiful  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:10):**  processes can take place where new diverse species sprout.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:14):**  They've been waiting for fire now that's their chance.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:18):**  Where the strong healthy plants that were able to burn back in the fire and they have  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:23):**  those deep root systems, they can now sprout with space and grow and thrive.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:29):**  So these are some of the benefits and that we get that nutrient load and that potassium  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:33):**  and all that nutrient cycling is great.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:37):**  So we've got to take each zone and look at the benefits or effects of fire in that zone  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:45):**  and then help manage for them.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:48):**  So then the other aspect of that is well then how do we as a species, as major changers  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:56):**  of the environment, how do we show up for this and how do we manage the new growth.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:03):**  And so some of the tools in the toolkit here are managed grazing is definitely a tool in  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:08):**  the toolkit.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:09):**  And we have to remember that a lot of these ecosystems evolved for tens of thousands of  
**[0:21:13-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:13):**  years with elk, antelope, bear and these species are no longer thriving in these ecosystems  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:23):**  and they were fuel load managers.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:26):**  So one of the things that we can do right off the bat is use our domesticated animal  
**[0:21:32-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:32):**  patterns of sheep, goats, cows in a managed rotational holistic way to mimic the patterns  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:41):**  of elk and antelope and bear to help reduce fuel loads.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:45):**  So that's one.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:46):**  The other one specific about the invasive species and one of my friends and mentors,  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:53):**  Penny Livingston, she's made a really good point on this which is that a lot of these  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:59):**  opportunistic invasive species are really functional.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:03):**  They're species that we could harvest for our own fuel, for our own fiber needs, our  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:12):**  own building needs.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:13):**  Some of them are medicinal, some of them are edible.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:16):**  And we've talked at length about a intensive management of these invasive plants, not through  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:24):**  a demonistic viewpoint that, oh, these are horrible, these are bad, we got to get rid  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:28):**  of them.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:29):**  Let's just bomb them with glyphosate and kill them off.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:33):**  But more from the point of view of what functions and uses do they have in our communities?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:37):**  What kinds of resources can they provide us?  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:39):**  And if we look at them from the resource lens, now we have species we can harvest heavily  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:46):**  which enables natives to then take over those niches as we harvest and pull out these invasives.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:53):**  But let's use them.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:54):**  Let's create industry.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:55):**  Let's create economy.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:57):**  Let's create medicine and fiber that we can localize these resources by heavily harvesting  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:06):**  those invasives.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:07):**  And I think that's a beautiful win-win function stack problem as a solution approach to looking  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:13):**  at the role that these invasives play.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:16):**  And then we also have to context this within the overall shifting climate, the overall  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:21):**  shifting of weather patterns, which is more or less the trend is warm weather is moving  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:27):**  north.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:29):**  And so as warm weather moves north, some of these species which may or may not be native  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:35):**  may have better adaptable qualities to a new kind of climate regime.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:40):**  And so they may provide erosion control functions or they might be providing forage for bees  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:44):**  and insects at times of the year when other things aren't.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:47):**  So we really have to weigh and balance all of this.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:49):**  And then back to the original point is that there's no one size fits all.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:53):**  This is really a ridge to ridge, valley to valley, meadow to meadow approach to look  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:58):**  at what's going on in any one place.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:02):**  What's the story of that place and what is the beneficial management regimes that are  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:07):**  necessary in that place?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:09):**  Yeah, I completely agree with that approach.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:11):**  I really like what you said about finding an economy or use for the invasive species  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:16):**  that we've otherwise treated as something that needs to be eradicated rather than something  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:21):**  that has inherent value in it and is most likely serving a use in the succession of  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:28):**  whatever plants are going to go after that either in tilling or re-fertilizing the soil  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:33):**  in some cases or, you know, depending on the plant, there's a lot of different functions  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:37):**  that they might serve.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:39):**  Now we've mostly been talking about the recovery of fairly wild or less actively cultivated  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:45):**  landscapes.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:46):**  What about the, let's say the more actively managed ones, human landscapes, lawns in particular  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:53):**  or public spaces?  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:55):**  Are there ways that we can start to manage those, especially in your area that would  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:01):**  have a healthier relationship with these fire cycles we just mentioned?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:07):**  So for our communities, the urban areas, the suburban areas, there's a pretty prescriptive  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:16):**  approach to protecting our communities from fire.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:21):**  First thing that needs to be said is follow the advice of your local fire department.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:27):**  And one of the things, here's a few of the things that they suggest.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:31):**  One is 100 foot defensible space.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:33):**  So essentially what that means is that 100 feet around your house where you live, make  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:39):**  sure that you don't have excessive fuel load.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:42):**  So if you've got a forest, you might want to manage the understory of that forest.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:48):**  If there's dead or dying branches or trees, remove them.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:53):**  Often we limb up our trees so that they are, you know, maybe 10 feet off the ground before  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:00):**  you hit the first branch.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:01):**  Because when a fire comes, you know, often a fire starts on the ground.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:07):**  And if we can keep it from going up into the canopy, that's the best case scenario.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:11):**  Then we have a low intensity healing type fire that kind of burns across the surface  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:17):**  without catching the canopy and burning trees down.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:21):**  That being said, coffee park, which got decimated in the Tubbs fire in 2017, one of the patterns  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:28):**  that we saw was when you look at those photos or you go through that community, which is  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:33):**  now being rebuilt, it was pretty apparent that the trees in that community were not  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:40):**  setting the houses on fire.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:42):**  In fact, it was the opposite that most of the trees that got burned down in coffee park  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:47):**  were burned because they were near a house.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:50):**  The house caught fire and then burned the tree down.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:53):**  And most trees that weren't up against houses didn't actually burn.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:58):**  So that was a really interesting pattern to see that, you know, the trees around your  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:03):**  house, trees around your property, they're not necessarily the problem.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:08):**  And in most cases, it's the houses themselves that are the biggest fuel load tinder boxes  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:15):**  ready to go up.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:17):**  After the Tubbs fire, we had a neighborhood gathering here in my neighborhood and where  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:22):**  we had about 50 families and folk that live around here.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:26):**  And we're all living on one to two acre properties.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:29):**  And we had a fire, a battalion chief come out and meet with us for a couple hours.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:35):**  That was really eye opening.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:37):**  And what he said that we need to do is you really need to go around your house and identify  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:43):**  any places where embers can ignite around your house.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:47):**  It might be around a deck.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:49):**  It might be a little shed that has, you know, gas cans in it.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:53):**  It might be the vents in your house.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:55):**  It might be dry leaves, you know, right around the base of your house.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:00):**  And really look for, you know, when the embers blow in because the fire is spread first and  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:06):**  foremost through the movement of embers, hot embers, and they usually blow ahead of the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:12):**  fire.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:14):**  So you've got these, you know, burning pieces of leaf and coal and wood and house and whatever  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:20):**  might be blowing across and starting all these little spot fires and those turn into big  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:25):**  fires.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:26):**  So how can we protect our houses from igniting?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:31):**  Certainly if you have trees that are, that have branches that are like touching the roof  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:36):**  of your house, those you want to remove.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:38):**  And that's good actually rodent control anyway, because rats like to use those as their pathways  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:42):**  to get into addicts and things.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:45):**  So you want to manage the vegetation around your house in such a way that you're not increasing  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:49):**  field load, but your vegetation is the least of your worries.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:52):**  Most people have junk, you know, I mean stuff like around the house.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:57):**  It's a wood pile.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:58):**  It's a, you know, timber for the deck that wasn't finished.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:02):**  It's gas cans.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:04):**  It's camping gear, you know, and you don't want to have a lot of stuff around the base  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:09):**  of your house.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:10):**  You can also store that in a storage shed away or make sure that you have things in  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:16):**  your garage well sealed up.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:18):**  So there's a lot of potential places for embers to ignite around your house.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:22):**  And that's one of the most important things to watch out for.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:26):**  One thing that I've noticed that happens is people get so worried about this, so worried  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:31):**  about their landscaping and having plants around the house, thinking that this is the  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:37):**  main fuel load you have to worry about, that folks end up doing this moonscape type thing  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:42):**  where they remove all the vegetation and they just pour concrete or they just have gravel  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:47):**  or something like that.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:48):**  And they think that that's going to protect them in a fire.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:51):**  Well, I confirmed it with our battalion chief that that's not actually necessarily going  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:56):**  to protect you.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:57):**  And one of the things that we found in the big fires around here is that some houses  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:01):**  were literally saved by the green vegetation around them.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:06):**  So a well thought out fire oriented landscape could actually protect your house.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:13):**  And one of the things we noticed was a lot of really green hedgerows that were well managed  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:19):**  became heat buffers from as the fire blew through, they might catch embers that would  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:26):**  have gone into the house.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:27):**  And instead they were caught by a hedgerow that was maybe 23 feet away from the house.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:32):**  And that the heat wave that precedes the flames also these hedgerows protected the houses  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:39):**  from those heat waves.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:40):**  Because sometimes it's not even an ember.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:41):**  Sometimes it's just the heat wave that's coming off of the fire is so hot and so intense that  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:47):**  it will ignite your house just by the intensity of the heat.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:52):**  And so again, you know, understand your context.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:56):**  Are you living on a ridge?  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:57):**  Are you living down in a valley?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:59):**  This is going to change how you approach your fire management around your house.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:04):**  Fire generally moves uphill.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:06):**  So if you live up on a ridge on the side of a ridge, then you want to identify what we  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:10):**  call chimneys.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:11):**  And those chimneys are your main fire corridor, your main fire zone.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:14):**  If a fire hit, it's going to run, it's going to ride up that chimney and right into your  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:20):**  house.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:21):**  So when you have that level of assessment, you can understand the pattern that fire might  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:27):**  follow in your neighborhood, in your region.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:31):**  Then you can start managing and designing for this specifically.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:36):**  And some of the things we're doing is we're thinking about shaded fuel breaks.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:40):**  So you've got places like Coffee Park, which was a very, you know, built up suburb, you  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:46):**  know, thousands of homes really packed in your typical suburb.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:51):**  That's different than a somewhat rural neighborhood like where I live, where everyone has an acre.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:56):**  But there's still a lot of us living on this land.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:00):**  Those are two different approaches that you'll have.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:03):**  And in my case, in my neighborhood, we have the ability to think about stopping fire at  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:13):**  the edge of our property, to think about different ways of, you know, if it's putting in ponds  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:20):**  and creating some cooling and fire breaks, that's great.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:24):**  We talk a lot about shaded fuel breaks.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:26):**  If you're in a neighborhood that is in a forested area, then how can you look at shaded fuel  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:33):**  breaks and ways that you can stop fire?  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:37):**  And the other piece that a lot of fire professionals talk a lot about, and it's really important,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:43):**  is they need access.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:46):**  And if you don't provide access when a fire hits and the firefighters don't feel safe  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:55):**  to drive up to your house, they're not going to do it.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:00):**  If it's not safe, they're not going to do it.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:02):**  They're going to let that place burn because they've got other people they want to save  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:05):**  and they don't want to put themselves at risk.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:08):**  So access, which is really about having open areas where a fire truck can turn around,  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:16):**  if that's the case, or having a neighborhood plan as well.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:23):**  One of the things we've been seeing a lot since the Tufts fires in these more rural  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:26):**  communities, folks are kind of erasing this concept of private property boundaries where  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:33):**  everyone's managing their own properties differently.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:36):**  And we're seeing now whole neighborhoods of people coming together and collectively talking  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:42):**  about how they're going to manage the fuel load on their properties, where they're going  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:47):**  to put firebreaks, where they're going to put escape routes.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:50):**  I've had neighbors say, hey, if you need to knock down my fence and get through my property  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:55):**  to escape in a fire, go ahead and do that.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:58):**  Things like that, where we can come together and have a plan collectively are very, very  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:03):**  powerful because we're not isolated in this.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:07):**  And our neighbors are really going to affect us.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:11):**  Right now, everybody should be mowing their tall grasses.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:15):**  And that's, you know, I drive by my local fire department and they've got their little  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:20):**  informational signs out there and they say, high weed mowing, be a good neighbor, mow  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:24):**  down your high weeds.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:27):**  That is the case.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:28):**  We should all be doing that, not only to protect ourselves, but to protect each other.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:31):**  So we have to come at this not as individuals, but as communities, as neighborhoods, and  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:38):**  create plans.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:39):**  In my neighborhood, we have a map of the neighborhood.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:45):**  On that map is not just people's information, but who has water tanks, who has ponds, how  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:49):**  much water is stored, where their fire exits and escapes.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:55):**  And so this is the kind of resilience that we need to be setting up.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:00):**  It's not just physical design, it's social design as well to give us those, you know,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:06):**  the best opportunity to stay safe in a fire.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:10):**  That's such good advice and I think transcends just fire preparedness and perhaps communities  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:16):**  that are at risk of flood damage or other types of storms could benefit from collaborating  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:22):**  and coming up with community-wide plans and figuring out how each property sort of plays  
**[0:35:27-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:27):**  a role in a larger preparedness for the things that most threaten those communities.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:34):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:36):**  And I think one of the big aha moments that we all got during these fires, because none  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:42):**  of us ever thought that Santa Rosa, that's the town where I grew up, got hit hard in  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:46):**  the Tubbs fire.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:48):**  You know, we didn't think Santa Rosa could catch on fire.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:50):**  I mean, there's 200,000 people living there.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:54):**  It's a city and you think about like a firestorm is going to blow through there.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:59):**  Okay, maybe a building will catch fire here or there, but a firestorm that can't be stopped,  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:04):**  it's literally taking out neighborhood after neighborhood after neighborhood.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:08):**  That felt like something that would never happen.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:11):**  One, because we've totally forgot our recent history, just 50 years ago history.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:17):**  Two, because we haven't had the wisdom to talk to our native people, the native people  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:23):**  that have been in relationship with these lands for so long.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:29):**  And so what that brought up is, and to your point about natural disaster, about flood,  
**[0:36:36-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:36):**  drought, fire, hurricane, earthquake, it's a sobering notion, but none of this is an  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:45):**  if it happens.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:47):**  And that's what we need to realize is it's a when, when is it going to happen?  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:52):**  Because these are natural phenomenons that humans don't have a lot of control in stopping.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:57):**  So even if the flood doesn't hit your community for 30, 40 years, if you're in a flood, it  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:06):**  will hit at some point.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:07):**  Even if your community is never burned, but there's a history of fire, at some point the  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:12):**  fire is going to roll through there.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:13):**  It's not an if, it's a when.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:15):**  And as soon as we acknowledge that, then we can start being smart about how we manage  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:22):**  and plan together.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:25):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:26):**  Now, you mentioned something earlier too, as warmer weather starts to move up north,  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:31):**  it's bringing species that maybe will out-compete or will adapt sooner.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:36):**  But there's a lot of other things to consider, especially in your line of work as an ecological  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:41):**  designer.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:42):**  Could you maybe talk a little about designing for lower consumption and perhaps maintenance  
**[0:37:47-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:47):**  as the area that we have come individually to understand being a part of whatever classification  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:54):**  you may have, whether it's the USDA hardiness zones or just the climate that you have come  
**[0:38:01-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:01):**  to rely on as a constant begins to change in whichever way based on your locale is going  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:08):**  to.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:09):**  How do you predict that and design for the changes that are likely to happen?  
**[0:38:17-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:17):**  First off, as a species down to a person, we need to become people of the land again.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:26):**  And what I mean by that is we have to go about our days each day, noticing what's happening  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:36):**  in the natural environment around us.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:37):**  Even if you're in an urban community, what kinds of weeds are growing, what kinds of  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:41):**  plants are growing, what kinds of birds are there, what's thriving, what's not thriving.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:46):**  Because again, it's all about place, not every place.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:50):**  There's so many microclimates and soil changes and topographical changes.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:56):**  Everything has to be context to place.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:58):**  And I start with that because I can see the patterns every single day.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:06):**  I can see what's getting hit by disease, what's thriving, when there's a disturbance, what  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:13):**  comes in first.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:14):**  It's all is just about awareness.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:16):**  And so first and foremost, if we all learn to become people of the land again, then we're  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:21):**  constantly in a communication and a dialogue with the ecology every day, whether we're  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:26):**  going to work or school or hanging out or whatever it might be.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:31):**  We're noticing the ecological patterns and the plant patterns and insect patterns.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:36):**  And that is the information that's going to, that's the data point that you need to be  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:42):**  able to understand the changes that are taking place and how we design for them.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:46):**  So that's first and foremost.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:48):**  Second off, it has a lot to do with our cultural aesthetic.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:54):**  And currently Western culture's aesthetic for landscape is a very English rose garden  
**[0:40:00-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:00):**  aesthetic, very, very perfect lawns and perfectly managed shrubs and trees and all of that.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:11):**  And that aesthetic is very, I want to say, you know, it's not very natural.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:16):**  It's not how the natural ecosystem, and when you talk about low impact and when we think  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:22):**  about, well, how can we reduce our consumption?  
**[0:40:26-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:26):**  A lot of that is in many ways, and this is counterintuitive again, but I've been, you  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:35):**  know, it's over 20 years now I've been doing permaculture and reading landscapes and working  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:39):**  with the land every single day.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:42):**  And in the last few years, what I've been really blown away by is how, what actually  
**[0:40:50-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:50):**  I need to do more is to get out of the way of natural systems evolution.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:57):**  That often the decision to not do something, to not intervene is as powerful or more powerful  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:07):**  than the decision to go in there and intervene in a system.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:11):**  Because in some ways there's a level of trust of the natural ecology to kind of have the  
**[0:41:18-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:18):**  deeper wisdom that we don't have to know how to adapt and change to the bigger changes  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:26):**  that are happening.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:27):**  And so there's a bit of trust in the more that I, and I'll give you an example, okay.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:32):**  This spring, as the news about the insect apocalypse started ramping up and the realization  
**[0:41:39-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:39):**  that we might lose the world of insects in the next 50 years, that's an insane, horrible  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:48):**  thing to consider.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:50):**  And I realized that on my little one acre homestead that I hadn't planted enough early  
**[0:41:56-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:56):**  spring forage, like C. anothis and silk tassel and manzanita, that would provide forage for  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:04):**  bees earlier on.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:06):**  So I was sort of, I was like, oh gosh, I haven't planted enough of these.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:10):**  But then the wild radish, which is a bane of many gardeners around here, because it's  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:15):**  a, you know, it's not a native and it grows really proficiently.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:20):**  The wild radish sort of like took over the garden in early spring in February and started  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:24):**  blooming.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:25):**  And I noticed that all the bees and butterflies were all over these radishes, like all in  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:32):**  the second half of winter and into early spring.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:35):**  And that was that realization of, you know, normally I would come out here and I would  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:39):**  cut back a lot of this and start to prep for spring garden.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:42):**  But this year instead, instead of taking that action to go intervene, I allowed that wild  
**[0:42:49-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:49):**  radish to more or less take over the garden and held back prepping my spring vegetables  
**[0:42:56-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:56):**  by probably about a month to allow this forage for wildlife to have its place.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:04):**  And that wild radish bloomed for months.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:07):**  And it was amazing.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:08):**  All the species, every day I go out there and look at everyone who's visiting these  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:12):**  flowers.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:13):**  It was absolutely amazing.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:14):**  And that's where I sort of just, you know, had that, ah, okay, you know, nature has a  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:22):**  wisdom that I need to trust.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:25):**  And the more that I can observe and listen, the more I can be in relationship and know  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:31):**  when to take action, when to intervene.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:33):**  Like for instance, an overcrowded forest that's full of fuel load.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:38):**  I would not hesitate to intervene in a situation like that.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:43):**  But in a situation like my garden, when we're trying to protect the future of insects and  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:49):**  I'm about to take out the main forage plant, okay, let me not do that.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:52):**  So a lot of it is about connecting and understanding and reading the patterns and learning how  
**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:59):**  to intervene and not.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:00):**  And the other side is to plant diversity, plant and diversity, plant a lot of different  
**[0:44:06-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:06):**  species and experiment in, you know, around our houses, around our homes.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:13):**  That's the place to experiment, not in the wild, experiment around your homes, plant  
**[0:44:17-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:17):**  a lot of diverse and I expect die off, you know, in every garden and landscape, I expect  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:23):**  certain things to die off.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:25):**  And that tells me something.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:27):**  Some plants that I, you know, didn't care that much about all of a sudden become the  
**[0:44:31-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:31):**  thriving anchor of the landscape and the provider.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:38):**  And so I have a new love for that plant.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:40):**  So a lot of it is about that approach.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:43):**  And I know these aren't like tangible, you know, here's a checklist of things you can  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:46):**  do.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:47):**  But I think it's this deeper understanding that leads us to make the right decisions.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:54):**  I think that's a great observation and definitely one of the commonalities that I've been sussing  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:58):**  out through these interviews, especially with people who have more experience and have been  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:02):**  doing this for a longer period of time, they tend to shy away from prescribed techniques  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:09):**  or things that have actually worked for them and tend to focus much more on pattern recognition  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:13):**  and observation.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:15):**  And it's really cool to see that kind of emerge from patterns themselves in the information  
**[0:45:22-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:22):**  that I'm getting when I ask certain questions.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:24):**  And it's causing me to think a lot more about how interaction within these systems that  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:30):**  we either create or that we simply go out and observe ideally in their most untouched  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:35):**  form can give us the information to create more elegant and compassionate designs.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:42):**  But also where does technology come in, especially as you're operating this on a business level,  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:48):**  to kind of gather information that either we couldn't observe on our own or would be  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:54):**  difficult to kind of compile or create as a data set.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:58):**  I'm talking, of course, like with computers and creating spreadsheets to crunch information.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:03):**  Perhaps if you have experience using drones or mapping technology like that.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:09):**  Where do those fit in with the on the ground observation of nature to help make more informed  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:15):**  decisions?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:18):**  They are important tools that we use daily to assess landscapes and provide those prescription  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:27):**  services for our clients.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:28):**  So the more that we can under, you know, there's a lot of different ways to understand the  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:32):**  land and not everyone's going to have, you know, to be able to not everyone's going to  
**[0:46:37-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:37):**  be able to walk onto a site and and take in as much information as someone who's been  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:43):**  doing that for 20 years can do.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:45):**  And sometimes the landscapes are really large and you're not going to be able to get much  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:49):**  in an even a single day walk around.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:52):**  So it's a it's kind of an all the above, right?  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:56):**  You've got your on the ground observation, which is one level.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:00):**  You've got topography and topographical maps, which are an essential tool for design.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:07):**  And all of our projects that are beyond like suburban scale, we produce topographical maps.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:14):**  Usually they're overlaid on satellite imagery.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:17):**  And then what's beautiful about that is then you can let me at least like with Google Earth,  
**[0:47:21-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:21):**  you can go back in time, maybe about 20 years in some cases and see satellite images of  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:29):**  the last 20 years of that site.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:31):**  But the more that we can understand the history of a site and that and when we say story of  
**[0:47:36-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:36):**  place, that's really what that is.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:38):**  That's that's really what we're talking about is, okay, what what are the patterns here?  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:43):**  Did fire roll through here at one point or what kind of natural disasters?  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:46):**  What were the dominant species that's, you know, in the past?  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:51):**  What kinds of social activities in the industry?  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:55):**  You know, was this logged?  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:57):**  Are these logging roads?  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:58):**  Is it a silage operation where they grew out here for 30, 40 years and mined all the nutrients  
**[0:48:04-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:04):**  out of the soil?  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:06):**  These are all really important aspects of that data collection and that initial site  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:11):**  assessment to understand soil, water, vegetation, climate.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:16):**  And the more that we understand soil, water, vegetation, climate, now we can start coming  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:20):**  up with a prescriptive design plan to move forward that really takes into account the  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:24):**  constraints and resources of that site.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:27):**  So drones have become a powerful tool for mostly from a presentation point of view,  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:34):**  I would say, because we also we want to provide professional services for folks and to provide  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:39):**  professional services means that the materials that we give them, whether it's maps or it's  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:45):**  written out notes and recommendations or it's concept plans, we want these plans and these  
**[0:48:51-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:51):**  maps to be professionally done, accurate, to scale most of the time, and really born  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:01):**  out of an understanding of the patterns in the history, the natural history of the site.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:05):**  So all of that, as the technology has gotten better and better, like the drones have gotten  
**[0:49:11-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:11):**  better and smaller and cheaper, we've been using that technology a lot more and it speeds  
**[0:49:19-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:19):**  up the ability to present concepts to clients, to educate them and move management forward.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:27):**  Now one of the challenges that we face in this work is how we educate clients around  
**[0:49:38-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:38):**  this.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:40):**  And when folks who are doing ecological landscape design, you have a choice.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:47):**  And I'm not going to say one way is better than another, but you have a choice.  
**[0:49:52-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:52):**  You can either provide landscape services to clients based on what the client wants,  
**[0:50:00-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:00):**  first and foremost, regardless of ecology, and you can build a nice business that way.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:06):**  Or as you deepen your understanding of a place, you can really push a client, educate a client  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:14):**  to make the right decisions based on the ecological resources and constraints.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:19):**  Now that's not always easy in most projects you find that middle ground, but the truth  
**[0:50:23-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:23):**  is, the more professional your presentation, the more accurate your information, you'll  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:32):**  have a much easier time of bringing a client on board to understand like, oh God, yeah,  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:37):**  I probably should manage that bit of forest at the edge of my property because it's a  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:41):**  fuel load issue, or I should focus on water catchment, even though I really just want  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:46):**  like a patio with some herbs and a place to hang out.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:52):**  Maybe I should put a rain garden into that herb garden and maybe my patio should be permeable  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:57):**  because of all these aspects related to water.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:01):**  So as ecological landscapers, we're an edge species right now.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:05):**  And one of the things that we're doing is we're bringing the traditional process of  
**[0:51:11-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:11):**  landscape design and construction together with the ecological way of managing the land.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:22):**  And I've spoken about this at length over the years, that the more professional we are  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:29):**  when we do that, the more effective we are.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:33):**  And if we just talk about the idealism, if we're just ideal and we talk about all these  
**[0:51:38-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:38):**  things that you tell a client, you should do this, you should do that because it's good  
**[0:51:41-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:41):**  for the water, you should do this because it's good for the soil, but we don't back  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:44):**  that up with data, we don't present it in a professional way, they're not going to get  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:49):**  it.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:50):**  And they may not trust it and then they might make different decisions.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:54):**  So we're sort of at the forefront of shifting the cultural narrative of landscape from an  
**[0:52:03-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:03):**  extractive, impose upon way to a regenerative, compose with nature point of view.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:18):**  And professionalism is our main tool, our main package to move the mainstream in this  
**[0:52:25-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:25):**  direction.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:26):**  Along those lines, what of the technology that you use commonly would you recommend  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:31):**  that someone starting out in this business invest in, in order to help them get to the  
**[0:52:36-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:36):**  next level and present themselves as professionally as possible?  
**[0:52:41-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:41):**  First off, you have to understand yourself.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:44):**  Google Earth, everyone should be using Google Earth in this work because it's so accessible.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:49):**  And even if all you do is you have a satellite image that you annotate on, you know, you  
**[0:52:56-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:56):**  draw some lines on it, or you print it out and draw on it that way.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:59):**  Yeah, it's the most simple baseline, cheapest thing.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:03):**  Everybody can use that.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:04):**  And even at our level, where I have a seven figure landscape company and 20 employees,  
**[0:53:09-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:09):**  we're still use Google Earth in our process.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:12):**  So it's so it works from beginner all the way to advanced level.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:15):**  So absolutely, Google Earth is is a key tool.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:19):**  And then when we think about design, you there's so many options there.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:26):**  And we use in our office, we use Auto AutoCAD, which is the industry standard for digital  
**[0:53:36-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:36):**  design plans.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:37):**  And one of the reasons why we use AutoCAD is because the architects are using AutoCAD,  
**[0:53:41-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:41):**  the engineers are using AutoCAD.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:43):**  And so it is very useful in using a format that is accepted across various trades and  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:50):**  various industries.  
**[0:53:53-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:53):**  Because you can now talk with other other professionals, you can integrate mapping concepts  
**[0:54:00-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:00):**  and and build and layer upon each other with that.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:04):**  So we use AutoCAD, but AutoCAD is a is an advanced tool.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:08):**  It's takes a long time to learn.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:11):**  And I wouldn't suggest anyone starting out that you should jump into that.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:16):**  It's something to work towards.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:19):**  And so there's a lot of different things out there.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:21):**  There's Dynascape, there's Inkscape, there's SketchUp.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:24):**  There's a lot of different tools.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:26):**  And if folks want to go digital, which is where you're going to be able to create a  
**[0:54:31-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:31):**  lot of these professional designs.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:35):**  Some of those might be I think Inkscape is free.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:37):**  So that might be a good place for people to start.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:40):**  Vectorworks is another one.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:42):**  So you have to decide if that's the path you want to take.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:44):**  Now for myself, I am not literate when it comes to digital design software.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:54):**  I'm not literate at all.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:55):**  I don't I don't use any of it.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:58):**  It's not my it's not my passion.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:00):**  It's not my forte.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:01):**  And but what I'm good at doing is I'm good at organizing other people.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:06):**  And so so I always tell my students, you have to know who you are.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:10):**  If you are so if you're if you're a hands in the ground person, and you're not it and  
**[0:55:17-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:17):**  learning a computer technology just isn't in the cards for you, that is totally fine.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:21):**  It doesn't mean that you can't get to that professional level.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:24):**  It just means that you need to partner up with somebody who has that passion and that  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:28):**  experience.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:29):**  And that's what I've done over the years.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:30):**  And now my design, my design department, there's currently three designers soon to be four  
**[0:55:35-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:35):**  designers in my design department that are producing these professional quality maps.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:42):**  Now if you have drafting skills like hand drawn skills, that's totally fine as well.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:47):**  You don't have to do things digitally.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:49):**  If you have if you can do artistic rendering by hand, in some sometimes that's even better,  
**[0:55:55-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:55):**  depending on the client.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:57):**  A well drawn out, hand drawn map can be beautiful and artistic, and a great way to communicate.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:05):**  So you have to know yourself your strengths and and and ask yourself what you're willing  
**[0:56:10-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:10):**  to learn and where you want to go with this.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:13):**  Ask yourself if you can work with others, if that's a model that works for you, because  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:16):**  thing is, when we talk about ecological landscaping, there are just so many different ways to go  
**[0:56:21-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:21):**  about this, which I think is so wonderful, because I think there's a fit for everybody.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:25):**  You could be the solo designer that has all the design chops and can produce these maps  
**[0:56:30-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:30):**  and you could have a whole business just you doing consultation and design.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:34):**  And that's it.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:35):**  You could build a nice business that way, regenerating the planet and inspiring people  
**[0:56:39-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:39):**  to connect with nature.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:41):**  Or like me, you can be someone who would prefer to be digging in the in the earth, or prefer  
**[0:56:47-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:47):**  to be walking on the soil and and build a team around you to do all the things that  
**[0:56:54-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:54):**  you don't like to do, but are necessary.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:57):**  And some folks, you know, going into the construction side of this is a whole different ballgame  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:04):**  than just doing being a consultant or in a designer.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:08):**  And it's not for everybody.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:09):**  And it's much more stressful to have the installation arm of doing this work.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:16):**  But it's, it's quite rewarding, because you're literally building regenerative system, like  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:23):**  you're not just conceptualizing it, you're actually in there building soil, planting  
**[0:57:27-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:27):**  trees, catching water, you get to see the results of your design of your work, you get  
**[0:57:32-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:32):**  to ensure that it's done right.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:34):**  You get to ensure that the impact is the is the minimum, the least negative impact on  
**[0:57:39-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:39):**  the land.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:41):**  And from a business point of view, instill construction installation generally has a  
**[0:57:46-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:46):**  higher profit margin as well.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:49):**  So it could be more of a financial approach.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:54):**  But there's a lot of liability, a lot of stress, you're managing staff, you're managing a team  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:59):**  of people.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:00):**  And so you have to know what your skill level is, and then and then build your business  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:06):**  around where your skill level and your passions are.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:11):**  That is another great set of advice there.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:13):**  And quite frankly, I wish I had heard that when I was first starting out in all of these  
**[0:58:18-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:18):**  different types of work, because I've struggled with basically every single one of those steps  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:22):**  that you laid out as the designer figuring out if I wanted to do my designs hand drawn,  
**[0:58:27-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:27):**  which was kind of always my skill set from before, but also realizing that there's a  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:31):**  lot of powerful technology that can speed that along or present things even in a better  
**[0:58:36-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:36):**  way.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:37):**  And then figuring out where I stand in the implementation, because in a lot of places  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:41):**  that I've worked in developing countries, there hasn't been someone else there that  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:47):**  I could either connect with very well, or that I could give these types of instructions  
**[0:58:52-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:52):**  over that either had access to the experience or the equipment to implement the designs  
**[0:58:58-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:58):**  that I'd put out.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:59):**  And by constantly being stretched so thin and resisting collaboration pretty early on,  
**[0:59:06-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:06):**  mostly just because I was kind of nervous about it and not knowing like how to manage  
**[0:59:10-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:10):**  other people.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:11):**  I was held back really early on by trying to do everything all at once.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:15):**  And like you said, some people can excel that way.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:19):**  They have the multitasking skills or they just are well organized enough to play all  
**[0:59:25-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:25):**  of those out.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:26):**  But the thing that I keep coming back to over and over again is that no one can be very  
**[0:59:31-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:31):**  good at everything.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:33):**  Though I consider myself somewhat of a jack of all trades, there's a reason why there's  
**[0:59:39-0:59:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:39):**  a second part to that label being the master of none.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:45):**  It's often kind of disregarded when people try and amass all of these skill sets, especially  
**[0:59:49-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:49):**  in a condensed period of time.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:51):**  And there's a certain amount of humility and accepting of limitations that I really wish  
**[0:59:57-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:57):**  that I had come to earlier in my career.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:59):**  I think I probably would have gotten further and been more of an expert in some of the  
**[1:00:03-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:03):**  things that I excelled at early on, rather than having kind of a competent but somewhat  
**[1:00:09-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:09):**  limiting understanding or proficiency in doing all of these other things when trying to deliver  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:14):**  the best quality product or service.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:18):**  Totally.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:19):**  And where have you found your niche?  
**[1:00:22-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:22):**  Other than just advising others on figuring out what theirs is, what are some of the other  
**[1:00:28-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:28):**  things that you have kind of found as guiding principles that have helped you get past some  
**[1:00:33-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:33):**  of these hurdles that you've seen perhaps other peers or people in the entrepreneurial  
**[1:00:37-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:37):**  side of ecological design sort of stumble on?  
**[1:00:42-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:42):**  I love that question.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:43):**  So there's two important sides to answer that question.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:48):**  First off, knowing yourself as much as you can.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:53):**  Not everyone feels like they have a path and not everyone feels like they really understand  
**[1:00:57-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:57):**  themselves.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:58):**  But to the degree that you can understand like where you get excited, what aspect of  
**[1:01:02-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:02):**  this work are you excited about?  
**[1:01:04-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:04):**  Where do you get turned on?  
**[1:01:07-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:07):**  And it's a little cliche to say, but what's your passion, follow your passion.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:13):**  This is all about understanding your context of who you are, what your skill set is, what  
**[1:01:17-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:17):**  you're excited about.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:19):**  So first off, you want to spend a little time to identify that.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:25):**  And then the other, what I've always done, and I think it's given me an advantage in  
**[1:01:28-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:28):**  life is that I am always setting goals way ahead of time.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:37):**  I do a two year, five year, seven year, 10 year set of goals.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:42):**  And once you first understand yourself, but go ahead and think about where you want to  
**[1:01:50-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:50):**  be in five years with the work.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:52):**  Like dream big.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:54):**  I'm always dreaming big.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:56):**  And I think that we, it's scary to dream big and often folks don't have the self-confidence  
**[1:02:04-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:04):**  to imagine that you can create that dream, but it's five years from now.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:09):**  So who cares whether you have the skill set now or not?  
**[1:02:14-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:14):**  What is that five year dream?  
**[1:02:15-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:15):**  What is that 10 year dream?  
**[1:02:16-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:16):**  Where do you want to be?  
**[1:02:17-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:17):**  You know, write it down, work it out.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:19):**  What's the world like?  
**[1:02:20-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:20):**  What's your role in your work?  
**[1:02:23-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:23):**  What's your role in the cultural revolution that we're a part of?  
**[1:02:29-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:29):**  Even if it just seems totally unattainable, write that down.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:33):**  So this is what I've done for the last 20 years and I, I've got my next 10 years all  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:38):**  planned out.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:39):**  Then what I do is I reverse engineer from that.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:42):**  Okay.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:43):**  So maybe I'll go out to a five year goal and then I start to reverse engineer.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:47):**  Okay.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:48):**  What are the skills I'm going to need to get there?  
**[1:02:50-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:50):**  What kinds of, what kind of team would I need to develop?  
**[1:02:54-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:54):**  Where do I need to be in my business?  
**[1:02:56-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:56):**  Where do I need to be physically?  
**[1:02:57-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:57):**  Where do I need to be in my relationships?  
**[1:03:00-1:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:00):**  And I start reverse engineering back from that.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:03):**  And as I start to reverse engineer back from my, my dreams there's particulars that come  
**[1:03:09-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:09):**  into place like, Oh, this thing's going to have to happen.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:12):**  I have no skill sets in that.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:15):**  So I'm going to, I know I'm going to need to collaborate with someone to do, to fulfill  
**[1:03:19-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:19):**  that.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:20):**  What is the skill that I need to learn?  
**[1:03:21-1:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:21):**  Okay.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:22):**  Well, if I have five years to learn that skill, maybe I'll just start really slowly right  
**[1:03:27-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:27):**  now.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:28):**  You know, maybe once a week I'll pick up a book on that subject or maybe I'll take that  
**[1:03:31-1:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:31):**  online class or something like that.  
**[1:03:33-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:33):**  And I'm not going to rush to learn that skill because I'm slowly going to incorporate it  
**[1:03:37-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:37):**  into my life and my work.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:39):**  I think ultimately what happens, and I did this a lot in my twenties and some of my thirties  
**[1:03:45-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:45):**  and the second half of my thirties, I'm 40 now.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:49):**  It started to shift and it's this tension between urgency and patience.  
**[1:03:55-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:55):**  The urgency comes from the state of the world.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:59):**  It comes from the need to take action now.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:05):**  But one of the things I've found that a lot of us do in permaculture movement, activists  
**[1:04:11-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:11):**  do this.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:13):**  People do this in general, is when we operate from a place of urgency, we may actually create  
**[1:04:20-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:20):**  more harm than good in the process of trying to make that change, whatever it might be,  
**[1:04:26-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:26):**  because we don't actually have the skills or the data or the organizations to actually  
**[1:04:33-1:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:33):**  make it come true in that short timeframe.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:35):**  So there's this side of patience and really it's how, you know, I always get inspiration  
**[1:04:41-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:41):**  from a tree, from an old tree or from a forest.  
**[1:04:44-1:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:44):**  And there's a 250 year old oak tree that I visit about five days a week.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:50):**  I hike out to this tree and I visit it.  
**[1:04:54-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:54):**  And one of the things that that tree has been teaching me lately, as I see all the birds  
**[1:04:59-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:59):**  that live in that tree and I have gratitude for the abundance of acorns it drops and the  
**[1:05:04-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:04):**  shade it produces and all the services of carbon sequestration and water filtration  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:10):**  and air filtration, all that is that I have to realize, well, you know, it took 250 years  
**[1:05:15-1:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:15):**  for this tree to get here to this level, operating at this level.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:19):**  It's not moving so fast today.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:21):**  You know, I'll sit at the base of this tree.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:23):**  This thing isn't running around trying to do a bunch of stuff.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:27):**  It's pretty chill.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:28):**  It's pretty present.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:30):**  So I've shifted in the last few years with my work to give myself more time.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:37):**  And one of the things people have said about me in the past is like, I bolt those into  
**[1:05:40-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:40):**  life and kind of what that means is that I'm willing to take a lot of risk, always willing  
**[1:05:44-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:44):**  to take risks.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:46):**  So the combination of taking risk of following the things that excite you and yet at the  
**[1:05:52-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:52):**  same time, taking time to learn and build skill sets that are necessary to achieve those  
**[1:05:59-1:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:59):**  bigger goals in life.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:01):**  That's that tension that you have to live in.  
**[1:06:06-1:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:06):**  And that is my suggestion for folks getting into this work is you know, you can move some  
**[1:06:15-1:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:15):**  things you can move quickly on and some things take time and what you need to cultivate the  
**[1:06:22-1:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:22):**  skill of perseverance of patience.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:27):**  We need to cultivate the skill of taking critical feedback because we live in cultures where  
**[1:06:34-1:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:34):**  we haven't been taught the emotional skills of being strong in ourselves.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:39):**  And because there's so much low self-esteem in our cultures these days.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:46):**  Technology doesn't help us with that.  
**[1:06:49-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:49):**  We have to have the, we need to be able to take feedback because that's what pushes you  
**[1:07:00-1:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:00):**  to learn.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:01):**  That shows you where your weak parts are.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:03):**  That shows you the gaps and places that you need to fulfill.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:06):**  And I think what happens a lot, and I did this a lot in my life, is that you go out  
**[1:07:10-1:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:10):**  there and you try something and you fail and somebody gives you some critical feedback  
**[1:07:15-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:15):**  about it.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:16):**  And a lot of people just say, I'm not doing that again.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:20):**  Screw that.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:21):**  Nope, not for me.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:22):**  Didn't give me those good feeling.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:25):**  I'm done with that.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:26):**  I'm going to try something different.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:28):**  So a lot of people give up self-rejection before you even had a chance.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:34):**  And the regenerative fire is going to burn through you.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:37):**  It's going to teach you a lot.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:38):**  It's going to knock you down.  
**[1:07:40-1:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:40):**  But those are renewal moments and there's gems in there.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:46):**  So once you let the emotions, feel the emotions that come up, it's okay to feel upset and  
**[1:07:52-1:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:52):**  whatever.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:53):**  But once those emotions settle, then you need to integrate that feedback.  
**[1:07:58-1:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:58):**  Integrate feedback, integrate, not segregate.  
**[1:08:01-1:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:01):**  And then you can grow as a person.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:02):**  You can grow in your skill set and you can grow in your confidence.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:06):**  And like a 250 year old oak tree that's working its magic, if we want to make big sweeping  
**[1:08:13-1:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:13):**  change in the world and in our lives and as a culture, then we need to have vision that  
**[1:08:20-1:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:20):**  is generational in its scope.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:23):**  And if we want to accomplish vision that's generational in its scope, then we need to  
**[1:08:27-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:27):**  realize that it's going to take lifetimes to achieve that.  
**[1:08:31-1:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:31):**  And once you are humbled by that, you can breathe into the next step and the next step  
**[1:08:39-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:39):**  and the next step and the next step.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:41):**  And you can be in a place of awareness of where you are on your journey and where you  
**[1:08:47-1:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:47):**  need to go.  
**[1:08:48-1:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:48):**  And feedback and failure becomes a gift.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:54):**  Man, there's so many things that I would love to continue to explore and unpack about everything  
**[1:08:59-1:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:59):**  you just said there, a lot of which has really rang true in my own experience.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:04):**  One of the main things that I've noticed or kind of sussed out from what you put down  
**[1:09:08-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:08):**  there is the idea of long term planning and the times in treating this perhaps as more  
**[1:09:17-1:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:17):**  of a marathon than a sprint and the differences in decision making that that cultivates in  
**[1:09:23-1:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:23):**  a mindset and how you see your ability to achieve or to complete goals in a much longer  
**[1:09:30-1:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:30):**  term sense, especially when you're working with natural systems, ecosystems, which are  
**[1:09:35-1:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:35):**  going to outlive all of us.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:38):**  And whether or not we are able to design in a way that takes into that much larger time  
**[1:09:44-1:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:44):**  frame and think about setting the foundations for nature to take over and to make the better  
**[1:09:51-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:51):**  decisions that we can't predict, certainly not from the smaller vantage point that we're  
**[1:09:55-1:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:55):**  at.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:56):**  But before we run too long on these, and I'd still like to perhaps schedule another interview  
**[1:10:02-1:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:02):**  or a chat at some point to unpack this further, but could you tell me a little about some  
**[1:10:08-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:08):**  of the books that you've been coming out with as well as the educational opportunities that  
**[1:10:13-1:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:13):**  you've been promoting through your different networks and your company?  
**[1:10:17-1:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:17):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:18):**  So at the Permaculture Skills Center, we're a five acre demonstration site in Northern  
**[1:10:22-1:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:22):**  California.  
**[1:10:25-1:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:25):**  We have two online courses.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:27):**  We've got the Ecological Landscape Mastery School, where it's a full on program to help  
**[1:10:35-1:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:35):**  people start and grow their ecological landscape businesses.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:39):**  And a lot of things we've talked about here, we talk about in there, but it's really an  
**[1:10:44-1:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:44):**  A to Z of design process, consultation process, client management and relationship.  
**[1:10:52-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:52):**  And then all based in permaculture principles and ecological principles, how to create your  
**[1:10:57-1:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:57):**  design plan, how to present it, and then how to move into install, how to create budgets,  
**[1:11:01-1:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:01):**  how to talk to clients about money, how to deal with tricky situations running the business,  
**[1:11:06-1:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:06):**  how to manage staff and employees.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:09):**  All of that is in the Ecolandscape Mastery School.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:15):**  And then we have our core modules, which have templates, contract templates, and design  
**[1:11:22-1:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:22):**  workflow process templates and all that.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:25):**  And then we also have live sessions.  
**[1:11:27-1:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:27):**  Every month I do a case study.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:30):**  Tonight I'm actually doing a case study on a 160 acre broad acre management project that  
**[1:11:36-1:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:36):**  I worked on years ago.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:38):**  But we also do urban case studies, just a full mix.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:42):**  And then we bring experts in to talk about anything from gray water to community organizing  
**[1:11:47-1:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:47):**  to QuickBooks.  
**[1:11:49-1:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:49):**  How do you run accounting software to carbon farming to no till farming, kind of like everything,  
**[1:11:55-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:55):**  all the different pieces of design and regenerative design we cover and all the pieces that are  
**[1:12:04-1:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:04):**  incorporated in providing those services to others.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:07):**  So that's the Ecolandscape Mastery School.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:09):**  And we have the Regenerative Agroforestry Program with Penny Livingston Stark.  
**[1:12:16-1:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:16):**  And that is a program all about regenerative agroforestry, assessment, design, implementation,  
**[1:12:22-1:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:22):**  species management.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:24):**  And we do live sessions once every season.  
**[1:12:28-1:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:28):**  But the whole core program is there for folks.  
**[1:12:32-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:32):**  So those are the educational components that we have.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:35):**  And I was talking about that future planning and reverse engineering and all that.  
**[1:12:41-1:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:41):**  And so over the last few years, I've written a number of books.  
**[1:12:44-1:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:44):**  I've written a couple of children's books.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:47):**  I produced a couple of educational coloring books.  
**[1:12:50-1:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:50):**  I came out with a personal development book called Activate Your Joy, which talks a lot  
**[1:12:55-1:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:55):**  about some of the things we discussed about self-confidence, about context, about future  
**[1:13:02-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:02):**  planning, reverse engineering, all that.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:04):**  And then I just came out with the Ecological Landscape Professional, which is really a  
**[1:13:08-1:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:08):**  book that distills all the aspects of how to take permaculture and traditional landscaping  
**[1:13:15-1:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:15):**  and integrate them together in a system so that we can create businesses that regenerate  
**[1:13:20-1:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:20):**  the planet and care for people.  
**[1:13:23-1:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:23):**  That book just came out this year.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:25):**  What I'm working on now is both in the world of fiction.  
**[1:13:33-1:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:33):**  I'm working on some projects right now that I can't talk too much about them.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:39):**  Part of the goal here is how do we shift the culture?  
**[1:13:43-1:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:43):**  How do we tell story in such a way that connects people back to nature, that vision's a new  
**[1:13:49-1:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:49):**  world, that vision's a way out of the current destructive practices that we have and recognizing  
**[1:13:57-1:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:57):**  that we are a species of story.  
**[1:13:59-1:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:59):**  We follow story.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:01):**  And it is in some ways the narrative of our culture are the kinds of media that people  
**[1:14:06-1:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:06):**  are consuming.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:07):**  And right now, a lot of the media that people consume are heavily racist, heavily violent,  
**[1:14:14-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:14):**  dystopian.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:17):**  And so can we breathe fresh air into our cultural storytelling that integrates the tools and  
**[1:14:24-1:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:24):**  the connective way of being that's required for us as a culture to find peace again.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:33):**  That's my main project.  
**[1:14:35-1:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:35):**  I'm working on it.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:36):**  And then this is my first time telling anyone this.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:39):**  I also have a big regenerative landscape book that I'm in the process on.  
**[1:14:43-1:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:43):**  So in the next couple of years, probably two to three years, those will start coming out  
**[1:14:49-1:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:49):**  and I'll talk more about them.  
**[1:14:50-1:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:50):**  Fantastic, man.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:52):**  Those sound like really exciting projects and I can't wait to see as they update and  
**[1:14:57-1:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:57):**  start to come out.  
**[1:14:58-1:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:58):**  Well, again, Eric, thank you so much for being so generous with your time.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:02):**  As always, whenever we chat or catch up, I got a whole lot out of this and I think it's  
**[1:15:05-1:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:05):**  going to be really important for the audience as well.  
**[1:15:08-1:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:08):**  So I'll leave it at that and hopefully we can schedule another session soon in the future  
**[1:15:13-1:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:13):**  to catch up again.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:15):**  I would love that.  
**[1:15:16-1:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:16):**  Thanks so much for the opportunity and I appreciate all the good work you're doing.  
**[1:15:19-1:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:19):**  Thanks so much, Eric.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:20):**  Take care.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:21):**  Bye.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:51):**  Bye.  
**[1:16:21-1:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:16:21):**  Thank you so much for listening and I'll see you again in next week's session.

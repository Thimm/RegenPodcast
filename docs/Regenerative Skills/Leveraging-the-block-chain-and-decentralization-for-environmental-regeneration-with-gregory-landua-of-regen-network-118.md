### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright everybody, before I get started with today's episode, I wanted to let you know  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:20):**  about a new project that I've just launched.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:23):**  After years of highlighting and promoting the knowledge, wisdom, and projects of innovators  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:27):**  and leaders in regenerative living through this podcast, I've realized that this audio  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:31):**  format can only ever reach so many people.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:34):**  There are so many others out there who engage more with other forms of learning.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:38):**  That's why I've started the Abundant Edge YouTube channel.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:41):**  Now that I'm back on the road and visiting regenerative and sustainable projects in my  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:45):**  travels, I'll be profiling the people and organizations that are making a real impact  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:49):**  on their environments and their communities.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:52):**  My goal is to show as many people as I can reach that you don't have to have a lot of  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:01:55):**  money, access to a ton of resources, or have a fancy education under your belt to make  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:00):**  a real difference in this world and create change.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:03):**  Now my first mini-documentary highlights the unbelievable achievements of a small community  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:07):**  called Kishaya in the highlands of Guatemala.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:11):**  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:14):**  owner who kept the ecosystem under monoculture cultivation and exploited the local people  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:19):**  who worked for slave wages on the farm.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:22):**  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:26):**  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:29):**  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:34):**  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:38):**  it and create a better life for their families.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:41):**  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:45):**  a profound abundance which you'll see in the documentary.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:49):**  Now if you want to see the rest, you'll have to check it out for yourself.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:51):**  You can find it really easily just by typing in Abundant Edge into the YouTube search bar,  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:02:56):**  and be sure to keep an eye out for more short films highlighting the projects that I visit  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:00):**  as I travel through Mexico and beyond.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:02):**  I'll also be releasing tutorials on everything from design theory to building and gardening  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:06):**  techniques in the upcoming months.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:08):**  I really hope that this will become a resource that, like the podcasts, helps to inspire  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:13):**  you to live your highest potential by living regeneratively.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:16):**  Alright, today building on the theme of profitable ecosystem regeneration, I spoke with Gregory  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:23):**  Landwey, co-founder of the Regen Network.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:26):**  Gregory has worked in Ecosystem Regeneration for a while, formerly working with TerraGenesis,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:32):**  NovaChocolate, the Regrarians platform, and Gaia University.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:36):**  In this interview, Gregory gives us an overhaul on what the Regen Network is and aims to accomplish.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:41):**  Specifically, we explore the roles of decentralized technology, including the emerging potential  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:46):**  of the blockchain, to create secure networks that facilitate collaboration, consensus,  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:51):**  agreements, and community.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:53):**  We also talk about what systemic changes would be needed to make permaculture-type stewardship  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:03:57):**  of the land our default as a culture rather than a fringe practice.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:02):**  Gregory also explains how technology can be leveraged for connecting people to crucial  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:06):**  information and to reach communities that have been left behind in the industrial information  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:11):**  age.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:12):**  The exploration of how technology can be harnessed for a global shift in consciousness and renew  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:16):**  cultural priorities is a topic that I'll be increasingly exploring on this podcast, and  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:21):**  I would love to hear from any of you listening if you have information or ideas on how the  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:25):**  incredible power of technology can be used to buck the trend that has been disconnecting  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:29):**  us from our natural world and sources of sustenance.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:33):**  Or if you believe that technology can only facilitate disconnection, what alternative  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:37):**  solutions are there to our increasing dependence on digital connectivity that you might propose?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:43):**  You can post comments and feedback on the website, or email me directly at info at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:48):**  Now before I get carried away, I'll turn things over to Gregory.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:52):**  Hey, Greg, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:56):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:57):**  I'm doing good, Oliver.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:04:59):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:00):**  I'm excited to dig in.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:01):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:02):**  I've been really looking forward to this chat for a while.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:05):**  I have a lot of questions about the Regen network, but what do you say we start from  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:09):**  the beginning and you tell us a little bit about your background and how you came up  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:12):**  with the concept for this network?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:14):**  Sure, that sounds great.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:16):**  So let's see, my background, I've been in the permaculture movement and making a living,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:25):**  you know, sort of with permaculture at the center of my vocation since 2006, I guess.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:35):**  And that's when I graduated from college and I studied environmental science in college  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:41):**  and sort of just transitioned into the permaculture movement.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:45):**  I really felt the call for solutions oriented, pragmatic, grounded action instead of just  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:05:56):**  the paralysis that I feel like is ubiquitous in the sort of like larger environmental and  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:02):**  many social movements as well.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:04):**  It's just like, it's just paralysis of like, wow, there's just so much wrong with the world  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:09):**  and then nothing.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:10):**  And, you know, I just really felt drawn to dig in where you're at and start regenerating  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:16):**  the soil, start cultivating a new relationship with the living world.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:23):**  You know, this beautiful experiment of meeting human needs while improving ecosystem health,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:31):**  which is how I sort of broadly define permaculture, was really compelling to me.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:37):**  And so, you know, I started digging into that.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:40):**  I apprenticed and taught, apprenticed as a teacher and worked at a couple of different  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:47):**  educational centers, Eco-Village Training Center, Lost Valley Education Center.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:53):**  And yeah, I also have to say, you know, a really formative experience for me was I was  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:06:58):**  in the first class of Gaia University International, which was really powerful, you know, action  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:04):**  learning oriented, rigorous community of learners and unlearners.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:11):**  And that was really powerful.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:12):**  And out of that, I started several businesses, one of which was Terrigenesis International,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:19):**  which is a still really potent design and consulting firm focused on sort of early,  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:27):**  early days focused on broadacre, permaculture and agroforestry internationally.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:33):**  And with a strong emphasis on trying to develop financial models so that land stewards could  
**[0:07:40-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:40):**  be sort of financially viable in how they're interacting with diverse and regenerative  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:50):**  landscapes.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:51):**  And Terrigenesis started to evolve because we started to feel a little disenchanted with  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:07:58):**  sort of one off design and consulting with landowners and felt like that wasn't really  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:05):**  an intervention point for systemic change.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:09):**  It's an okay livelihood and it's really fascinating and can be quite fun, but it doesn't really,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:15):**  you know, to achieve landscape scale regeneration or community scale regeneration, it didn't  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:20):**  seem like the entry point.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:21):**  And so we started to evolve our offerings to focus more on interacting with businesses  
**[0:08:28-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:28):**  and those businesses that are activated and woke around regeneration and the potential  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:37):**  that humans have as a keystone species in a vibrant agroecosystem.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:41):**  We just wanted to work with those businesses to help them interact with the origin communities  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:48):**  that they're sourcing ingredients from and really create reciprocity and regeneration  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:53):**  as like the base layer of how those relationships are taking place.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:08:57):**  And that adventure, sort of that vocational shift in adventure is directly what led to  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:09:07):**  the creation of region network a couple of years ago out of that work.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:09:11):**  And you know, I'll just sort of say one more thing before I pause and hand it back over  
**[0:09:17-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:09:17):**  to you, which is that I think at the base of what region network is focused on attempting  
**[0:09:27-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:09:27):**  is reconnecting transactional value, currency agreements, the management of common resources  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:09:40):**  to ecological regeneration.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:09:43):**  And so I think one of the things that we're trying and sort of like the blue sky vision,  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:09:48):**  which I try to remind myself of as we get into the weeds with all the technology and  
**[0:09:53-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:09:53):**  economics and the pilot projects and everything is really to create a new currency, a new  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:02):**  way of exchanging that is backed by ecological regeneration.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:08):**  Or that is to say that the emergent property of multiple people exchanging on the platform  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:15):**  results in ecological regeneration.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:17):**  If I am making an agreement with you, if I'm transacting with you, sort of the net outcome  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:25):**  of that is the regeneration of an ecosystem or an agro ecosystem.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:29):**  And that's what we've been sort of holding as part of our North star as we dig in and  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:34):**  create this project.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:36):**  Now that's fascinating, especially as we're getting into new technology, especially around  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:42):**  decentralized movements, blockchain and other ways of sort of creating, but also keeping  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:48):**  track of transactions in many, many different ways.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:52):**  And to direct these types of initiatives and technologies towards ecosystem generation  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:10:59):**  seems like the natural progression for the regenerative movement in general.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:05):**  Tell me a little bit about how you plan to accomplish those blue sky goals and what are  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:10):**  some of the tools that you're using to accomplish them.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:13):**  Yeah, well, I think we're being very pragmatic.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:15):**  I mean, at its essence, Regen Network is a platform for making agreements about ecological  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:22):**  health or agreements that are anchored in ecological health.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:25):**  So whether that's sort of, you know, variable interest rate loans from financial institutions  
**[0:11:34-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:34):**  that the, where the interest rate lowers when ecological performance increases or the creation  
**[0:11:44-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:44):**  of carbon credits or biodiversity credits, land stewardship agreements, product premium  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:54):**  agreements, these are all at their most intrinsic fundamental level.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:11:58):**  They're all agreements that are based in understanding ecological health and having consensus between  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:06):**  multiple parties about the ecological health that is producing that sort of fundamental  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:12):**  to executing an agreement.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:14):**  So we're really keen on building usable, simple tools where a business and a farmer can make  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:25):**  an agreement that's grounded in ecological health.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:28):**  That's what we're up to right now.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:29):**  You know, we're running pilots.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:32):**  One of the ones that I'm most excited about is a set of cacao purchase agreements with  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:40):**  a smallholder farmers cooperative in Ecuador, where there's an amazing group of businesses  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:47):**  that are paying a premium to farmers that's linked to ecological performance, to their  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:12:53):**  ability as land stewards to maintain biodiverse, vibrant rainforest farms.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:13:00):**  And you know, what we're doing is simply sort of creating the trust layer so that the different  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:13:10):**  parties, A, can understand how they really are performing around their own sort of self-generated  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:13:17):**  understanding of what ecological health means and making that information available to all  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:13:23):**  the parties and B, making it possible for agreements to be executed between those parties.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:13:30):**  So the technologies that we're using there, it's sort of at the intersection of, as you  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:13:37):**  were noting, decentralized distributed web systems like blockchain, where we're building  
**[0:13:44-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:13:44):**  a blockchain that is essentially a custom domain specific blockchain focused exclusively  
**[0:13:54-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:13:54):**  on a ledger of ecological health as the base layer of agreements between parties on the  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:05):**  blockchain.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:06):**  So that's one element.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:07):**  And then we're linking that to cutting edge, super geeky fun advances in geospatial technology,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:17):**  remote sensing, drone imagery, sensors on the ground.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:25):**  And also, because our roots are also quite firmly planted in kind of the appropriate  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:31):**  technology, small is beautiful, sort of permaculture EF Schumacher world, we're also trying our  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:38):**  best to create this tool so that it's simple and easy for people to make, to sort of create  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:44):**  their own verification methodology instead of just taking for granted that it's going  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:48):**  to go this high tech route.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:49):**  Although we also believe that in order to achieve the scale of making regeneration and  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:14:56):**  a permaculture approach, sort of ubiquitous and just the status quo, we need to sort of  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:02):**  embrace and metabolize the technology that is now coming online and direct it towards  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:10):**  an anchored and ecological regeneration.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:12):**  So there's a bit of a yes hand taking place there.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:15):**  Sure.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:16):**  And I got to say, this is one of the reasons why I was attracted to Regen Network, because  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:20):**  I've been in touch with a lot of other organizations that are trying to create a societal shift  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:26):**  by throwing out a lot of the models that we currently use and are kind of the foundation  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:31):**  of how the world operates right now.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:35):**  And you seem to be going in a different direction by actually utilizing the infrastructure that  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:39):**  is there, the technologies that are coming online constantly to, you know, perhaps improve  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:45):**  workflows or opportunities in certain ways and just redirecting those towards something  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:52):**  positive and regenerative rather than, so to speak, sort of throw the baby out with  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:58):**  the bathwater.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:15:59):**  Why do you think that that approach is perhaps easier for people to get on board with?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:06):**  Not to say one is better than the other, but I myself feel a bit more attracted increasingly  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:10):**  towards the approach that Regen Network is taking.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:13):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:15):**  Well, you know, so I recently I gave this talk in San Francisco.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:24):**  It wasn't so recent.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:25):**  It was about eight months ago.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:27):**  And you know, I was on stage just after Charles Eisenstein was on stage and who's a great  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:33):**  thinker.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:34):**  And, you know, his recent work on climate and sort of his whole body of work is kind  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:41):**  of asking us to deeply consider.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:44):**  It's pretty radical and it's kind of asking us, you know, likely you have to sort of let  
**[0:16:49-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:16:49):**  go of many of the just like the status quo of technology and how our society works.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:00):**  And I think the permaculture movement in general, there's a lot of thinking in that direction.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:04):**  And I myself, you know, I resonate with some of that.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:08):**  I also think and to get to your point that, you know, everybody in that room where I was  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:15):**  giving that talk, this is my point, everybody in that room had a smartphone.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:18):**  Most of the people in that room are sort of resistant to embracing the, you know, hyper  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:27):**  connected big data, you know, technology driven world.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:34):**  And I myself, I'm not a techno utopian by any stretch of the imagination.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:39):**  However, I firmly believe that we have to be realistic and confront this massive, crazy  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:49):**  moment in our history where technology, especially information technology is sort of reaching  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:55):**  this ubiquity.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:57):**  It's just everywhere.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:17:59):**  And if there's a group of people who everybody in there, everybody's got a supercomputer  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:03):**  in their pocket and everybody's using it to get manipulated by Facebook.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:09):**  You know, my question to people are, is, you know, why not design ways to use that enormous  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:21):**  power in your pocket and the enormous power of big data and the enormous power of publicly  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:27):**  available satellite information and the enormous power of all of these different technologies  
**[0:18:31-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:31):**  to live our values out, to actively take agency, to regenerate ecosystems and to respect dignity  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:42):**  and sovereignty of individual humans and communities.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:45):**  Why not use those tools?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:47):**  We simply can't.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:49):**  It's like the other strategy is like the ostrich strategy where you just stick your head in  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:53):**  the sand and you pretend that that, that, that those technologies don't exist.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:57):**  So it isn't the easy path.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:18:59):**  The easy path is not to engage with that technology.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:04):**  Easy path is to stick your head in the sand.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:06):**  But in my mind, there's an imperative.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:09):**  There's sort of a demand.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:11):**  The demand of our time right now is that we take the, the challenging sort of pathway  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:22):**  to engage with these technologies and reframe them into an ethos of earth care, people care  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:28):**  and fair share that, that ethical framework of permaculture.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:33):**  You know, how can I work with the technology that is being created out of a different framework  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:40):**  and out of a different understanding of the world?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:43):**  How can I engage with that technology and transmute it and metabolize it and reground  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:49):**  it so that it is useful to catalyze and support a movement, a planetary scale movement of  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:54):**  regeneration.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:19:56):**  That's really at the core of what is driving me and I think the rest of the region network  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:01):**  team as well.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, I really resonate with that message as well.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:05):**  And it seems like while there is an incredible amount of potential for positive use for these  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:11):**  technologies, unless we kind of come up with a consensus that particular applications of  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:18):**  this power are better than others and that are driving us towards something that benefits  
**[0:20:23-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:23):**  everyone rather than continuing everything from resource and money distribution inequality  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:32):**  as it has kind of worked till this point.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:36):**  Until we come up with that consensus, it is going to drive a kind of a larger rift in  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:41):**  between the people who are consuming these things and people who are sort of curating  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:47):**  them.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:48):**  And I see a lot of potential in the decentralized movement, especially on the technology side  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:20:54):**  to perhaps dissipate the effect of these few large players that seem to increasingly have  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:02):**  a monopoly on the way that we engage with the technology in our pockets and perhaps  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:08):**  open up for a conversation about how access to this power might be better served for the  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:14):**  people who at this point are not really getting the benefits from it yet.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:21):**  So how have you looked at the potential of decentralized technology in order to sort  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:29):**  of advance the goals and the vision for ecosystem and community regeneration that you're pursuing?  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:36):**  Yeah, well, that's a great question and it's a constant tension.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:43):**  So I think just to frame this, I believe that if we take Facebook, for example, I'm pretty  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:55):**  pragmatic about things.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:21:56):**  I don't believe that Mark Zuckerberg had bad intentions when he started Facebook.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:01):**  I just think he was kind of ignorant and naive.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:06):**  He's negligent.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:09):**  Is naivete.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:11):**  But maybe there's negligence there.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:13):**  I think the negligence is more social than probably individual.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:17):**  He grew up, he went to Harvard.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:19):**  They're not teaching the things that they need to teach people at Harvard.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:23):**  That's just not happening.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:24):**  So he may not have even had the potential to have the thoughts that he needed to have  
**[0:22:29-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:29):**  in order from day one to create a platform that considered that it's a commons, considered  
**[0:22:38-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:38):**  that it is a public space, considered that commercial making the users the product and  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:47):**  commercializing their data would be problematic.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:52):**  I think now that's stunningly obvious to anyone who's thinking about this, but I think it  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:22:59):**  may not have been stunningly obvious at the time.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:02):**  And if it was, then that's problematic.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:04):**  But I tend to give the benefit of the doubt that it wasn't stunningly obvious.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:08):**  It is stunningly obvious now to anyone and everyone.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:12):**  It should be.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:13):**  And so what we're building is similarly, it's a platform.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:18):**  In order to succeed, we need many different users to interact with it.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:22):**  The cumulative effect will be built by different users engaging to make ecological agreements.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:29):**  And the network effect of the platform is what will create the result of planetary ecological  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:39):**  regeneration and ease of use, et cetera.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:43):**  We need many people to use it.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:45):**  However, from the beginning, we're accepting that that is actually sort of there's a governance  
**[0:23:52-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:23:52):**  burden and we must design it so that there is a decentralized power structure and a democratic  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:01):**  governance structure and that the users themselves have control over how the value is getting  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:07):**  distributed.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:08):**  So, you know, I think we're just learning from the mistake that these first generation  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:13):**  platforms have made, which is alienating them from their users.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:17):**  I mean, who trusts these platforms?  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:19):**  Maybe we're all still using them out of convenience, but there's a general growing unease about  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:26):**  it, right?  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:27):**  And there's murmurs of regulation and all these things.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:29):**  And so from the beginning, in order to succeed in our aim, we just feel very strongly that  
**[0:24:36-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:36):**  we have to sort of bake in agency and decentralization from the beginning.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:45):**  Because, you know, we could succeed building something that's user friendly and everybody  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:51):**  could use to do something.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:53):**  But if that just gets bought in a corporate takeover and, you know, in a big IPO and then,  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:24:59):**  you know, all the people who bought the shares of the company are just like, great, let's  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:04):**  extract as much value out of this as we can.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:07):**  We haven't shifted the system.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:09):**  And in order to shift the system, that reciprocity and the relationship between users and the  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:14):**  earth, users and ecosystems is prime.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:18):**  That's the primary.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:19):**  And really, there's sort of a, there's like a constitutional question here.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:24):**  If you think about a group of people having a set of agreements that they change the game  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:30):**  from this zero sum, I win and you lose, the earth loses and I win in the short term.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:36):**  That's a very short term game.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:38):**  We have to shift the game to a non zero sum game in which both of the different actors  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:45):**  who are making an agreement and the earth are all achieving sort of a net increase.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:52):**  And what that means is that there can't be the level of extractive winnings.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:25:58):**  You know, there isn't this like bonanza.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:00):**  There's like a slow, steady, you know, just like cultivating your backyard forest garden.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:09):**  It's a slow, steady path to creating overwhelming abundance.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:14):**  It's not a quick liquidity event.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:16):**  It isn't a stock market bonanza.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:18):**  It isn't this just like all of a sudden you're rich from one day to the next.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:23):**  And the balance of that, creating the balance and coordination of that is a game theoretical  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:31):**  challenge.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:32):**  It's an economic challenge.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:34):**  It's a governance challenge.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:35):**  And that's where decentralized technology comes in because essentially with blockchain  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:40):**  we're hard coding in a set of rules and in sort of enforcing that in order to it to make  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:47):**  a network upgrade in order to change the way that value is being distributed, we need the  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:55):**  participation of the network to vote on that and to make it possible.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:26:59):**  And the hope is that that anchors it in this sort of like a reality in which to win the  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:07):**  game, you have to be benefiting the earth and you have to be benefiting the other users.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:11):**  And that's what winning looks like.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:13):**  Winning doesn't look like the liquidity event, right?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:16):**  And that's a big, big, big, big paradigm shift.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:19):**  And you know, it's not easy to get the kind of platform that we're talking about funded  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:26):**  frankly either because people, investors are so socialized to the exit.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:31):**  They're so socialized to the liquidity event, which you know, is essentially, it's like  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:39):**  sapping the strength of a host as a parasite and then exiting and finding somebody else.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:44):**  That's what, you know, literally like that.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:48):**  That's what liquidity in the modern economy looks like.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:51):**  And you know, I think we're all starting to wake up and realize that that just can't happen  
**[0:27:55-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:27:55):**  because we have, you know, the earth is finite.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:02):**  The irony is that it's not really finite.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:04):**  Syntropic relationships and the abundance of life can ever increase in complexity, beauty  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:10):**  and abundance, but you can't extract the base layer of living capital out of the system  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:17):**  forever and like that translation of living capital, financial capital, it has its limits  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:24):**  and we've already gone past it.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:26):**  And so now we have to reverse the trend.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:28):**  You know, we have to reinvest in living capital and make that win.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:34):**  That has to be the winning adaptive strategy for a big enough proportion of humanity that,  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:41):**  you know, we have a beautiful, intact, thriving biosphere and cultures that are geared towards  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:48):**  stewarding that.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:49):**  Well, so how do you think that we can start to make these shifts in our forward thinking  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:28:56):**  in order to take into account where value is really coming from, how it can be extracted,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:01):**  but more importantly, how it can be regenerated so that it continues to be a resource for  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:06):**  future generations?  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:08):**  Do you think it's in the educational models that need to be transformed?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:11):**  Do you think it's like an economic incentive, perhaps through regulation or through other  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:17):**  kinds of incentives that are going to turn this around faster?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:21):**  Or do you have other ideas about where this shift could happen?  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:24):**  Well, I think it's all the things, you know.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:28):**  Education, worldview, transformation, super important, how we, you know, we started our  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:35):**  conversation talking about child rearing and, you know, that's also important.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:42):**  It's also really important, it would be great to see regulation and if done properly, you  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:48):**  know, who knows, maybe the new green deal will offer some hope.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:29:55):**  I think our theory of change is that it's sort of voluntary market driven change is  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:05):**  a key element.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:06):**  I'm not a, you know, maximalist when it comes to kind of like market driven approaches.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:12):**  It just happens to be, you know, where I've felt called to intervene.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:19):**  And so I think, you know, if you start to get a critical mass of companies and brands,  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:24):**  localities, individual actors, small businesses, all accounting for ecological health and making  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:31):**  goals around ecological health and executing agreements about that, I think you start to  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:37):**  see a big sea change happen.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:38):**  And I think the moment that a big enough group of people starts to see the regenerative potential,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:46):**  the regenerative impact of their actions, things will start to change.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:50):**  Like there'll be a sea change because that is way more fun, right?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:53):**  But just right now, we can't see it yet.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:30:57):**  You know, and so I think what region network is trying to do is make that visible, you  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:01):**  know, make it visible the regenerative potential of groups of people to make agreements with  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:08):**  one another and then to, you know, to follow through those agreements and see what happens  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:12):**  and let everybody else see what happens.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:14):**  And once that becomes visible, I, you know, our theory of changes that will kind of become  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:20):**  an avalanche and it will just be fun and exciting and, you know, meaningful and just reconnect  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:28):**  business to meaning.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:30):**  You know, if our collaborative efforts are generating abundance and that abundance can  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:35):**  in some way kind of be quantified and exchanged and traded and we can have fun, we can even  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:40):**  speculate about it.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:42):**  Hey, that's, you know, that unleashes a bunch of creativity.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:45):**  And I think that's part of what we're aiming for.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:49):**  Do you feel that there's a way of explaining or demonstrating the value of other forms  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:31:55):**  of currency other than just money or perhaps tangible resources that might start to be  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:00):**  able to be quantified with this new technology and particularly blockchain technology and  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:06):**  the decentralized movement that would help to bring value to aspects of our society and  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:11):**  especially our ecologies that at the moment are really undervalued?  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:17):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:18):**  So, um, back in the day, um, my, um, colleague, Ethan, so Livia and myself wrote Regenerative  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:28):**  Enterprise and introduced the eight forms of capital, which has become a framework that's  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:32):**  pretty commonly used in, in a, in a lot of different places, which is kind of cool and  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:38):**  surprising.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:39):**  And, you know, as I was saying earlier in the podcast, you know, I think the, the trend  
**[0:32:44-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:44):**  of today is the liquidation of living capital and the ballooning and, um, in, in exchange  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:53):**  for financial capital.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:55):**  And we have to reverse that trend.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:32:57):**  And in order to reverse that trend, we need to understand that living capital, um, in  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:02):**  order to be accurate, in order to be real needs to sort of be a poly culture approach,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:08):**  not a monoculture approach.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:09):**  There is not just like one living capital currency, right?  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:13):**  We need to create the ability for fungible and non fungible, or that is to say, um, exchangeable  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:19):**  and non exchangeable different forms of accounting for things.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:22):**  We need to be able to create place sourced context specific bio regional, um, living  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:30):**  capital currencies.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:31):**  And in a way that's, we're building the infrastructure for that at region network so that different  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:37):**  parties can decide on the accounting framework that makes sense, whether it's quantitative  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:42):**  and you were thinking about, uh, increases in soil carbon, which we can quantify or increases  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:48):**  in biodiversity, which we could quantify or water quality or, or some index, some really  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:33:54):**  powerful local index of regenerative indicators that can be quantified.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:00):**  Or if we're thinking about qualitative agreements where there's like a sacred connection between  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:05):**  people, I think both ends can be used to reconnect the value system.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:11):**  I think, you know, one place where I find myself, you know, I think there's a, there's  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:18):**  a movement which is great and I applaud it to understanding that sort of the qualitative  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:25):**  and the unnameable is really important in thinking about value and that we can't just  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:31):**  get caught up in numbers.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:33):**  And on the other hand, we need to be able to understand in numbers with our rational  
**[0:34:38-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:38):**  minds and account for and stop externalizing the deep value that is, uh, are, that are  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:46):**  our living systems.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:49):**  And I think we need both of those.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:51):**  And I think what we're building at region network is an attempt to put, um, accurate,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:34:59):**  scientifically robust, quantitative measurement tools that are linked to real ecological regeneration  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:06):**  in the hands of people to make agreements about those.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:09):**  That's like one of the fundamental, um, sort of utilities that we're bringing to bear.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:15):**  Hmm.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:16):**  Now up until now, we've talked a lot about sort of the concepts and theories behind societal  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:22):**  shifts, um, different forms of value and currency, but you've been working on the ground with  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:28):**  these things for a while.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:30):**  And I'd love to hear some tangible examples either in your own work or in collaborative  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:35):**  efforts with others, how you've seen these things in action that give you hope that this  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:41):**  is starting to move in the right direction.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:44):**  Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of things that are very hopeful these days.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:48):**  You know, the regenerative agriculture movement is starting to pick up steam.  
**[0:35:52-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:35:52):**  Um, my own, in my own life, you know, I've been working at in Ecuador in this cacao origin  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:00):**  for almost 10 years now.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:02):**  And I've seen huge shifts, uh, both in the health of the farms.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:06):**  Um, soil is richer.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:09):**  Um, the biodiversity is being preserved.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:13):**  There's sort of a growing movement, both of farmers and of cacao buyers.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:19):**  The price of the cacao that's being generated by these farms has gone up, um, significantly,  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:26):**  you know, and there's premiums being paid for the stewardship outcomes that are, um,  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:31):**  that have been achieved.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:32):**  And that, that origin story is really exciting and inspiring to me and it's not the only  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:39):**  place.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:40):**  And so I think there's sort of a growing movement of awareness that sort of the higher intrinsic  
**[0:36:46-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:46):**  value of a product that is, is being produced on a regenerative biodiverse farm with a happy  
**[0:36:54-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:36:54):**  farmer, uh, as the land steward is way higher than, you know, a monoculture extractive production  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:04):**  model.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:05):**  And I think there's a growing understanding and linkage between those land stewards and  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:11):**  producers and the customers at the end.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:16):**  And that's really inspiring.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:17):**  A lot of that is being led by, you know, um, entrepreneurs and business owners who just,  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:25):**  you know, are sort of flying in the face of short term, the short term profit motive.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:30):**  I always laugh about the, you know, like Adam Smith's theory of a rational man and that  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:34):**  people only make decisions for their short term benefit.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:38):**  I, that, and my experience is not true at all.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:41):**  I know so many people who are just working so hard for, um, longterm health and longterm  
**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:49):**  resilience and, and the regeneration of ecosystems.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:53):**  And, um, just the, the, the name of the game is making sure that the business and financial  
**[0:37:59-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:37:59):**  reality is stable, not necessarily earning giant profits.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:07):**  And that's what has anchored the success of that origin in Ecuador, which I've been referring  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:13):**  to as a very like concrete example.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:16):**  Um, eco cow is the name of the, of the cooperative.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:20):**  I don't think they have a website right now, but you'll start to see more like we're working  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:24):**  on in that context, you know, to make it very grounded.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:27):**  What we're working on is, you know, up uploading into an immutable land ledger, the, um, geospatial  
**[0:38:36-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:36):**  information of the individual small farms and linking soil samples and biodiversity  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:43):**  transects and satellite imagery so that you can see this farm that produced this cacao  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:49):**  has this type of agroforestry system, right?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:52):**  And that that is just sort of can be passed on, um, tied to in a digital way, the product  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:38:58):**  that's being generated and sold by that farmer so that it increases the value of that cacao  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:04):**  so that people can see the bird habitat and the biodiversity corridors and other elements  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:09):**  that are part of the farming system there.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:12):**  Right.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:13):**  And that's just, it's a fundamental transformation of how a value is being produced and transacted.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:22):**  It's really, really radical and really powerful.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:25):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:26):**  And I like that you use the example of a, of this cacao business because I've been in  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:31):**  touch from here in Guatemala with a couple of outfits that have started to do very similar  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:37):**  initiatives, maybe not in a cooperative model yet, but on a smaller scale.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:41):**  And yeah, like you said, the, the, the tangible results that are visible, that are quantifiable  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:48):**  really give me, uh, some inspiration and some hope that even in the, in sort of a micro  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:54):**  application like this with a single product being produced, how would I say like it's,  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:39:59):**  it's giving examples of how the market can start to support these things and how it doesn't  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:05):**  have to necessarily start from scratch.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:08):**  There are enterprises that can be adjusted and tweaked in order to become regenerative  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:13):**  and start to produce more than they take in, uh, with a lot of other ripple effects for  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:19):**  the health of the community, the health of the individuals working on them, uh, the health  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:23):**  of the communities that are being supported by this income and giving meaningful work  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:28):**  to the people who are engaged in these enterprises.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:31):**  Now there are still a couple of roadblocks in the way, and I know you've talked in the  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:35):**  past about needs for changing sort of at a systemic level, permaculture and permaculture  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:42):**  like stewardship in order to make it the norm, the way that we operate, the way that we take  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:48):**  care of our ecosystems rather than the exception where, where it kind of currently is.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:54):**  I mean, there's a couple of different levels here.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:56):**  One is just to like, I love the permaculture movement.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:40:59):**  I, you know, all love and you know, out of that love, I have some strong opinions.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:06):**  I mean, I think that permaculture has, it's like, it's, it's like people don't want it  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:13):**  to become the norm.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:15):**  People are happy.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:16):**  Their identities are tied up and being the like rogue, the only people who get it feeling  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:24):**  misunderstood.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:25):**  I mean that we people, we just got to get over that.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:28):**  It's got to, it's got to that, that psychological block got to get over it.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:33):**  Kind of gravitating to the idea of this being a counterculture thing.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:36):**  And it's almost, you know, kind of cool or I don't know, validating to, to feel like  
**[0:41:43-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:43):**  you're not part of the mainstream, which is obviously going in a poor direction.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:47):**  And, and nobody, and it's just sort of, you get attached to that and then you have a tribal  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:51):**  identity and that part of that tribal identity is sort of like, it's going to push away from  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:41:56):**  the very people that we need to get excited.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:02):**  People need to get excited about it.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:03):**  It can't be ours.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:04):**  It has to be everybody's.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:08):**  And getting over this exclusionary idea that perhaps if someone has come from another industry,  
**[0:42:13-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:13):**  say the oil industry for example, or other areas that maybe we harbor some judgment or,  
**[0:42:19-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:19):**  or some opinions about that, that kind of alienate people from joining or offering contributions  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:26):**  that perhaps aren't the same ones that we have or that we valued in the past, but realizing  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:31):**  that everybody's contribution toward a positive goal is a positive contribution.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:39):**  And we just need to be reasonable about that, you know, and excited even.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:44):**  And so that's one thing.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:46):**  I think another thing is just upping our business game.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:50):**  You know, it's, you know, I want to see permaculture ventures, regenerative enterprise ventures  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:42:56):**  that are financially viable now.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:01):**  That has to happen.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:02):**  People's vocation, people's livelihood.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:06):**  And we just got to step up to the plate.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:08):**  And I am the first person to say that the US dollar is essentially an extractive unit  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:18):**  of account.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:19):**  It's basically like a fraction of the oil reserve that is maintained by the US military.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:27):**  You know, it doesn't represent life, but that is the social consensus right now is that  
**[0:43:36-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:36):**  is our currency.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:38):**  And if we can't find ways to provide value to our society commiserate with having a livelihood,  
**[0:43:48-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:48):**  then we're never ever going to achieve the kind of shift, kind of cultural shift where  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:56):**  that unit of measurement has a different value.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:43:59):**  And so people need to build businesses that break even at least.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:04):**  And hopefully build some businesses that are wildly successful and profit even in the short  
**[0:44:10-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:10):**  term craziness that we have without extracting value, without degenerating ecosystems.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:18):**  And there are ways, I think, to do that.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:20):**  They're sort of few and far between.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:22):**  But that's the demand, I think.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:25):**  If we're going to bring this to the level that it needs to, to avoid some crazy planetary  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:36):**  consequences, we need to just step it up and kind of have fun doing it.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:42):**  There's nothing to lose at this stage.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:45):**  There's nothing to lose.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:47):**  It's sort of like fail big and beautifully.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:49):**  If you've got that crazy idea, just step up and make it happen.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:53):**  The other thing, you know, the other thing, I mean, that's sort of a call to the entrepreneur,  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:44:57):**  to the powerful individual, to the people who just want to take life by the reins and  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:01):**  make it happen, which is awesome.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:04):**  I think there's also a real need.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:05):**  The third need in our movement is for people to coordinate and collaborate and follow one  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:16):**  another.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:17):**  I'm so glad you mentioned that because that's exactly what I was going to ask next is like,  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:21):**  where do you see the importance or the value in joining forces and actually using the resources  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:27):**  and the technology that we have that make it easier than ever for us to share ideas,  
**[0:45:32-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:32):**  to get ideas and concepts out to a large audience for very little money?  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:38):**  Yeah, it's amazing.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:39):**  How can that be harnessed?  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:41):**  We live in an amazing time in which I think it is accurate.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:44):**  You know, this is always said, but there's never been a new idea, right?  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:48):**  That's probably true.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:49):**  I read the classics, like I'm always surprised.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:53):**  And I think even increasingly so, we have to disconnect our egos from like none of this  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:45:58):**  stuff that I'm talking about is mine or my idea even.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:03):**  I'm just inspired by it and doing the best to live into it and to embody it and to collaborate  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:11):**  with other people who resonate and feel the same.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:14):**  So I think that's one.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:15):**  It's like a principle for collaboration.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:17):**  Like it's not yours.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:18):**  No, you kind of have to get your ego out of it.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:22):**  What would you just say?  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:23):**  It's part of why I have this as an interview format rather than me just regurgitating what  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:28):**  I heard from people like you and others that I've interviewed because, you know, they probably  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:33):**  didn't come up with those ideas either.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:36):**  It's a way of translating and communicating them in different ways, making the connections  
**[0:46:42-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:42):**  between that, you know, probably have been made, but everybody's voice and everybody's  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:47):**  way of communicating has value in reaching perhaps new audiences and making it make sense  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:53):**  to other people who perhaps didn't make those connections yet.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:46:57):**  And so if you're inspired by something, lean in.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:00):**  I mean, region network is a we're doing our best to design it to be, you know, our technology  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:08):**  base is open source.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:09):**  If you're a coder and you're inspired by what I'm saying, this is a free and open source  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:14):**  software project.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:16):**  Dive in.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:17):**  We have so much work to do and you can repurpose what we're doing for what you're thinking  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:21):**  about.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:22):**  Awesome.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:23):**  More power.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:24):**  Because if I, if you do something amazing with it, then I can pick it up and repurpose  
**[0:47:27-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:27):**  it for our work.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:28):**  And so the open source software movement is a big inspiration.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:31):**  It's very exciting.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:32):**  And the linkage of that to blockchain and the ability to also have like a financial  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:38):**  model behind open source technology is also very exciting.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:41):**  So there's that element.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:43):**  You know, and I think getting good at being a follower, I am constantly humbled and constantly  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:50):**  working on my ability, you know, in quotes as a leader to just be the best follower possible.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:47:56):**  You know, there's so many people who are better than me, who are smarter than me, who can  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:01):**  see things more clearly than me on so many different levels and parts of this project  
**[0:48:06-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:06):**  that I think a big skill that's lacking is the ability for those of us who have strong  
**[0:48:14-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:14):**  voices or you know, are striving and excited about things to be able to shut up and listen,  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:20):**  you know, for one and for two to be able to start to learn how to be a good support person,  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:27):**  how to like be uplifting, whether it's like cleaning the office or watering the plants  
**[0:48:33-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:33):**  or doing the dishes.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:35):**  You know, like we learned these things from our parents, or at least we should have, you  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:38):**  know, help out, just roll your sleeves up and do a little bit here and a little bit  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:43):**  there.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:44):**  Help the people who are taking initiative.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:46):**  And you know, the third thing I would say is criticism is, it can be really healthy,  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:53):**  but it also can be so erosive.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:48:57):**  And so I think we got to get over that we need to give people in quotes feedback.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:04):**  You know, are way more self aware than we give them credit for.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:08):**  And so telling somebody what you think is wrong with their shit, I don't, I'm sorry,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:14):**  but that's not the way forward.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:16):**  You know, creating the space where somebody has the energy to reflect on how they can  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:21):**  improve it themselves is way more potent and powerful than telling them what you think  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:26):**  is wrong.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:27):**  And that's a big, big, big cultural shift because, you know, feedback in quotes has  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:34):**  become a huge part of how we think we need to interact with one another.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:38):**  And I'm just not into it.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:39):**  I think that isn't to say that, you know, as individuals, like my choice is to try to  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:44):**  listen deeply to people who are critiquing and not take it personally.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:48):**  Right.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:49):**  But that's an intrinsic motivation of mine.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:52):**  On the other hand, I notice that I transform my behavior way better when I have a little  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:49:57):**  bit of space to reflect myself on what I could do better and to deeply internalize that.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:04):**  And that intrinsic motivation is so much stronger.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:07):**  And so, you know, that's another thing is just how to be in community, how to communicate  
**[0:50:12-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:12):**  with one another.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:15):**  It's so important.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:16):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:18):**  I really, I'm really glad that you brought up those aspects because those are all things  
**[0:50:21-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:21):**  that we can cultivate in and within our own lives and our own personalities that are things  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:27):**  we can work on on a daily basis.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:29):**  You know, sometimes it can seem daunting to try and take on these big ecosystem regeneration  
**[0:50:33-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:33):**  tasks or, you know, put forward an initiative or a project.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:39):**  But it's definitely worth working on these everyday skills that open us up to being better  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:45):**  contributors and like you said, be of service to other people as well and that we don't  
**[0:50:51-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:51):**  have to take this all on our own backs.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:52):**  So with that in mind, tell me a little bit about how this resonates within your own life  
**[0:50:59-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:50:59):**  because we've talked a lot about sort of the global shift and how things are moving on  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:04):**  a larger scale.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:05):**  But this is deeply personal to people like you and myself.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:07):**  I know you've just welcomed a new member of the family into your life and talk to me about  
**[0:51:13-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:13):**  what it means for you to live regeneratively and how that connects with you and your family.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:18):**  Yeah, that was a great question.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:20):**  I mean, I think it's a constant humbling awareness that we could be doing better.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:25):**  I mean, I think at the moment I've focused on sort of like this larger platform building.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:31):**  And so the little things that I do to just sort of keep my hands in the earth, so to  
**[0:51:37-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:37):**  speak, you know, just making sure to do things like compost, making sure to keep my, I do  
**[0:51:43-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:43):**  seed saving, I grow out some lineage corn and ancestral grains.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:50):**  And, you know, I'm also a member of a farmer co-op down in Ecuador and just try to sort  
**[0:51:55-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:55):**  of like stay connected to that as I can.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:51:58):**  And also, you know, it's busy and I run a tech company and, you know, so it's taken  
**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:04):**  my kid out to do nature connection every day and making sure that we're taking a walk and  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:09):**  hanging out by the stream.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:10):**  Those are all the little day to day things to just help keep myself sane.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:15):**  That said, you know, I'm very passionate and excited as soon as possible to start transitioning  
**[0:52:21-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:21):**  my life to sort of more low overhead, more simple living.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:24):**  And you know, that takes, it's a process, right?  
**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:27):**  You have to do that slowly and surely if we're going to stay also connected with these bigger  
**[0:52:33-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:33):**  ventures, right?  
**[0:52:34-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:34):**  These bigger platform building.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:36):**  Yeah, it's a big thing.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:38):**  So yeah.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:40):**  Yeah, that's my best.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:43):**  That's my best attempt.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:44):**  It's a great question and a pretty hard one.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:46):**  It's something I think about a lot too.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:48):**  I'm always curious to get the opinions of other people that I look up to on that as  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:53):**  well.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:54):**  It gives me new insights into my own journey.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:55):**  Now before I let you go, could you please tell our listeners how they can reach out  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:52:59):**  to you, get in touch and perhaps even help out and contribute to the goals that you're  
**[0:53:04-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:04):**  working towards?  
**[0:53:06-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:07):**  Well you can search for Gregory Landwey, L-A-N-D-U-A on LinkedIn and connect with me there.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:14):**  I try to do a good job of managing messages.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:18):**  I think that's how we connected Oliver and you can connect to region.network and you  
**[0:53:28-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:28):**  can see there, there are GitHub and GitLab.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:31):**  If you're a developer, you can connect to open source, join the movement, coding for  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:38):**  life.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:41):**  We've got a Telegram channel that you can ping us on.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:44):**  All that information is on region.network.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:47):**  Our forums, Riot and Telegram, all the different ways of connecting.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:53:54):**  Yeah and just you can also ping me on Facebook, ping me on Twitter.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:02):**  I'm happy to connect with people as I can.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:04):**  I also do try to minimize the amount of time that I'm interacting online with the balance  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:11):**  of family and project management.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:15):**  But I also, I firmly believe that it's important to be connected and available so I do my best  
**[0:54:22-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:22):**  to just kind of stay in touch and I'm happy to hop on calls with people if I've got time.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:29):**  And also in terms of the larger connection and coordination with the project, I am definitely  
**[0:54:34-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:34):**  not the only person to connect to or even the center of activity in a lot of ways.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:42):**  So if you've got an idea about a pilot, you can write to info at region.network and they'll  
**[0:54:52-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:52):**  put you in touch with our product pilot manager.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:54:55):**  If you're interested in development or code, we can connect you with the engineers.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:00):**  So there's a whole community of people working on things that you can feel free to just reach  
**[0:55:06-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:06):**  out and we'll connect you to the right person so that you can engage.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:10):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:11):**  Well, hey Gregory, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:15):**  I got so much from this conversation and I really look forward to staying in touch in  
**[0:55:18-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:18):**  the future and watching how this network continues to grow and evolve and mature because I find  
**[0:55:24-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:24):**  a lot of inspiration in what you're doing and the people that you're starting to bring  
**[0:55:29-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:29):**  in to these endeavors and these very noble goals as well.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:32):**  So again, thank you for taking the time.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:35):**  Thanks so much, Oliver.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:36):**  Hasta la regeneration siempre.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:37):**  Cabal, que bueno.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:38):**  Bueno hablamos pronto.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gregory-landua/#t=0:55:39):**  Okay, ciao.

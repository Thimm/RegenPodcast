### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 31 May 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright everybody, before I get started with today's episode, I wanted to let you know  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:20):**  about a new project that I've just launched.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:22):**  Now after years of highlighting and promoting the knowledge, wisdom, and projects of innovators  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:26):**  and leaders in regenerative living through this podcast, I've realized that this audio  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:31):**  format can only ever reach so many people.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:34):**  There are so many others out there who engage more with other forms of learning.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:38):**  That's why I've started the Abundant Edge YouTube channel.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:41):**  Now that I'm back on the road and visiting regenerative and sustainable projects in my  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:45):**  travels, I'll be profiling the people and organizations that are making a real impact  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:49):**  on their environments and their communities.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:51):**  My goal is to show as many people as I can reach that you don't have to have a lot of  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:01:55):**  money, access to a ton of resources, or have a fancy education under your belt to make  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:00):**  a real difference in this world and create change.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:03):**  Now my first mini-documentary highlights the unbelievable achievements of a small community  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:07):**  called Kishaya in the highlands of Guatemala.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:10):**  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:14):**  owner who kept the ecosystem under monoculture cultivation and exploited the local people  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:19):**  who worked for slave wages on the farm.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:22):**  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:26):**  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:29):**  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:33):**  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:38):**  it and create a better life for their families.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:41):**  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:45):**  a profound abundance which you'll see in the documentary.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:48):**  Now if you want to see the rest, you'll have to check it out for yourself.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:51):**  You can find it really easily just by typing in Abundant Edge into the YouTube search bar  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:56):**  and be sure to keep an eye out for more short films highlighting the projects that I visit  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:02:59):**  as I travel through Mexico and beyond.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:01):**  I'll also be releasing tutorials on everything from design theory to building and gardening  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:06):**  techniques in the upcoming months.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:08):**  I really hope that this will become a resource that, like the podcasts, helps to inspire  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:12):**  you to live your highest potential by living regeneratively.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:17):**  In continuing this month's focus on fixing the food system, I had the pleasure of speaking  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:21):**  to a personal hero of mine, Sean Sherman, the author of The Sous Chef.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:26):**  Now Sean has been the recipient of a First People's Fund Fellowship, the Bush Foundation  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:31):**  Fellowship, National Center's 2008 First American Entrepreneurship Award, the 2018  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:37):**  James Beard Award for the Best American Cookbook, and a 2019 James Beard Award for Leadership.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:43):**  Sean has been cooking around the US and internationally for the last 30 years and his main focus  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:48):**  has been on the revitalization and awareness of indigenous food systems in a modern culinary  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:53):**  context.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:54):**  Sean has also studied extensively on his own to determine the foundations of these food  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:03:58):**  systems and to gain a full understanding of bringing back a sense of Native American cuisine  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:03):**  to the modern world.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:05):**  Now in this interview, Sean and I talk about how he became passionate about the history  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:09):**  and traditions of indigenous food.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:11):**  He starts by educating me on how North America got to the point where indigenous culture  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:15):**  and food systems have been all but wiped out and why it's so important for us to reconnect  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:20):**  with the native plants and animals that used to nourish the original peoples of North America.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:25):**  We also cover traditional farming and land management methods, why they're an essential  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:29):**  part of switching to a more ecological food system, and the health benefits that this  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:33):**  way of eating can have on our bodies as well as the land.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:37):**  Sean also gave me advice on how to transition to a pre-colonial food system that goes much  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:42):**  further than just the native traditions of North America.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:46):**  This is one of the most essential perspectives on fixing the food system through holistic  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:49):**  means that connects nutrition to land stewardship, cultural connection, and spiritual revival.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:54):**  So I'll turn things over now to Sean.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:04:57):**  Hey Sean, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:00):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:01):**  I'm doing great.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:02):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:03):**  My pleasure.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:04):**  Now I've been looking forward to getting in touch with you for quite some time, especially  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:07):**  because of some of the parallels in our work.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:11):**  You and I were just talking about how I've been living in a small indigenous community  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:15):**  here in Guatemala, and you've been working with the indigenous communities around the  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:20):**  Northern part of the United States, which is very near where I grew up as a kid as well.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:26):**  So could you tell me a little bit, first of all, about your upbringing and how you became  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:31):**  passionate about the history and the traditions of indigenous food?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:35):**  Well, I was born and raised on Pine Ridge, South Dakota, and I'm enrolled with the Obolala  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:41):**  Lakota Sioux Tribe.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:42):**  All my family, both my parents were born and raised on Pine Ridge.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:47):**  And I started working with food at a pretty young age.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:51):**  My mom moved to South Reservation right before I started high school, and I started working  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:55):**  restaurants when I was about 13.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:05:57):**  And I just worked restaurants off through high school and college, and eventually moved  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:01):**  to Minneapolis shortly after college.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:04):**  And I crawled my way up into an executive chef position fairly quickly in the cities,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:09):**  and I've been chefing in many different areas since around 2000.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:15):**  A few years into my chef career, I just all of a sudden had this epiphany moment.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:21):**  And I was actually, I was working really hard in Minneapolis, and then I kind of got burned  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:26):**  out of one job and took a little break.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:28):**  So I just flew down to Mexico and ended up living in the state of Mayarit in a small  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:34):**  town called San Pancho.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:37):**  And I just got really interested in some of the indigenous peoples that were of that region.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:42):**  And that just kind of struck me that I didn't really know that much about my own indigenous  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:49):**  background.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:50):**  So I started looking at it through food, and it was kind of striking to realize that I  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:06:57):**  could name off hundreds of European recipes off the top of my head, and barely a handful  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:02):**  of recipes from the Lakota that I thought would have been traditional, without the influence  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:08):**  of Europeans.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:09):**  So it kind of threw me on a path to really try to understand what is Native American  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:15):**  food?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:16):**  What were my Lakota ancestors eating?  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:18):**  How were indigenous peoples, what were some of the commonalities that people were utilizing  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:23):**  of food?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:25):**  And it just kind of grew and grew and grew.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:26):**  So I started first just trying to research Lakota, but then it eventually started growing  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:32):**  and growing, and then moving out to Minnesota.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:34):**  I was really focused on learning a lot more about how they were living in those regions,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:39):**  and how some of the Anishinaabe, Chippewa tribes were utilizing their food systems.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:45):**  And then today, we were looking at basically all of North America, and how indigenous food  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:51):**  practices are immense and extremely diverse, but there's so many commonalities throughout.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:07:58):**  And we really try to celebrate that diversity and the indigeneity through the food system.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:03):**  And there's just so much to explore.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:06):**  I think it's fascinating, and probably very common among Native communities, like your  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:11):**  own experience, where you had a stronger connection growing up with the food and the culture of  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:18):**  the colonizers, rather than your own community.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:22):**  And what was it, or in fact, could you educate me a little bit on how North America in particular  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:28):**  got to the point where indigenous culture and food systems have nearly all been wiped  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:33):**  out?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:34):**  Well, we looked, especially in the US and Canada, it's really the colonial approach  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:40):**  that was really destructive towards indigenous people.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:43):**  And a lot of this was really recent history for a lot of indigenous communities.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:48):**  So we look at just the US, for example, when the US is a brand new country in the late  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:08:56):**  1700s, most of what is considered the US is completely under indigenous control at that  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:02):**  point in time.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:04):**  And the US government doesn't really push hard until even after the Civil War in the  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:10):**  1840s.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:11):**  And then they just really set their sights on taking over all of this indigenous land,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:16):**  stretching out to the West Coast.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:18):**  And we see during that time period of the mid-1800s, the late 1800s, just the complete  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:26):**  theft of all these indigenous lands.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:28):**  And then what really was destructive was the forced assimilation efforts of wiping away  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:35):**  so much indigenous culture through knowledge, basically.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:38):**  So you see these generations of kids being forced to learn not what they should have  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:44):**  been learning.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:45):**  They should have been learning thousands of generations of knowledge of how to live sustainably,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:49):**  utilizing plants and animals around them, how to hunt, how to fish, how to gather, how  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:54):**  to farm, how to teach others, how to do all of that.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:09:57):**  And instead they're being forced to speak English and learn different religions and  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:03):**  being taught skills that were very servitude, like carpentry and house cleaning and sewing  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:08):**  and so forth.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:10):**  So for a lot of indigenous communities like my own, that was just going on.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:14):**  Like my great-grandfather was still growing up traditional on the plains in the 1850s.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:19):**  But by the end of his lifetime, he sees his kids, he sees his family getting forced onto  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:24):**  reservations, he sees his kids going through the boarding schools, and he eventually sees  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:29):**  his kids grow up and fight for the US government.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:31):**  And that all happened in one lifetime.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:34):**  So for me, I was just trying to go backwards just a couple of generations to really try  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:40):**  to understand where did all that knowledge go and how much can you save and how much  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:44):**  can you pull out of it.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:45):**  So we see places, you know, in Mexico is a different story because there is a lot of  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:50):**  indigenous foodways still left alive.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:53):**  And we look at, you know, the food system is still largely more indigenous than it is  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:10:57):**  French or Spanish in parts, you know, with the mixed-moly corns and the chilies and the  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:01):**  squash and the beans and use of insects and all these kinds of things.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:06):**  But for the US and Canada, especially because of those boarding schools and residential  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:10):**  schools of just, you know, reprogramming so many indigenous peoples, we started losing  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:16):**  so much knowledge.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:18):**  But we're at a point where we can start to relearn, reintroduce and revitalize a lot  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:23):**  of those knowledges just by practicing them basically.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:28):**  And I, you know, I've found a lot of that in my own experiences here living in Guatemala,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:32):**  how though there are still very strong connections to indigenous food culture, that even without  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:39):**  the forced assimilation that has been more prevalent in the North American countries,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:45):**  there's still an ingression of a lot of colonialized food, maybe not forced on it the same way,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:52):**  but definitely incentivized through global economic models and what they can make money  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:11:57):**  off of versus what has less value on a global market.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:01):**  You're starting to see heirloom varieties of corn and other staple crops disappear.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:07):**  Youth isn't used nearly as much.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:10):**  And there's actually a lot of people around our communities that don't know of it or haven't  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:14):**  used it.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:15):**  And I mean, there's a huge amount of loss in the cultural diversity and in the dietary  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:21):**  authenticity of these places, even without that kind of government sponsored pressure  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:28):**  to move away from the authenticity of their culture.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:32):**  How have you worked with some of the many environmental benefits of reconnecting to  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:38):**  the native flora and fauna of the places that we inhabit?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:42):**  Because when we start to talk about cultivation of just the crops that arrived from colonization,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:49):**  those weren't necessarily appropriate for the lands or for the communities that were  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:54):**  prevalent before these people arrived.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:12:57):**  Correct, so we really believe in trying to absorb as much knowledge from our indigenous  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:04):**  ancestors as possible and apply those teachings today to have this kind of evolution of what  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:10):**  is a modern look at indigenous food systems.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:14):**  And it's really about changing the way we look at our own food access because we can  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:18):**  create a lot of our own food access.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:21):**  So we look at searching out and finding a lot of those air varietals of indigenous agriculture  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:27):**  that still exists today with the corns and sunflower and amaranth and so forth, but also  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:33):**  really being aware of hyper-aware of the regions and the plants around us and the seasons that  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:40):**  they come in and looking at indigenous harvesting techniques and just understanding how much  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:46):**  more food we could be adding to our pantries and to our food systems in general.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:52):**  There's so many of this plant diversity around us no matter where we are and so much of it's  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:13:58):**  completely underutilized pretty much across the board because of the colonial food systems  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:04):**  that we've been living in for so long.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:07):**  So we practice really hard to learn about the plants around us and learn how to implement  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:14):**  with them and be role models basically of how to bring that back into our diet.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:21):**  So we just see a lot of value in that part particularly, but we also believe that we  
**[0:14:27-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:27):**  can be smarter as humans and start to really re-landscape utilizing plants that grow well  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:35):**  and are from our region to create a better source of food around us because we could  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:39):**  just be using our space so much better.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:41):**  Now as modern humans we can pretty much landscape any way we want to and if we were smart about  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:47):**  it we would just be putting food all over the place and really utilizing those resources.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:52):**  And as chefs and culinary people it's exciting to see all of these extra flavors and all  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:14:57):**  of these plants and it's almost a never-ending database out there especially when we're looking  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:03):**  at something as large as North America as a whole.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:07):**  Yeah that's one of the things that I really love about this approach that you've taken  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:11):**  not only in your cookbook but also through your nonprofit and community work is that  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:15):**  there are so many different ways to connect with this.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:18):**  If you're a foodie you get access to new flavors and combinations that we're not used to getting.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:25):**  If you're an environmentalist this can have a huge positive impact on the environments  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:30):**  in the way that they're cultivated.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:32):**  If you're interested in reviving community and culture this is a whole other aspect of  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:36):**  being able to connect with the landscape and the history of indigenous peoples.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:42):**  So let's focus a little bit on the nutritional aspect.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:47):**  What do you think can be gained by rediscovering the native foods of wherever somebody might  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:54):**  be living because you know perhaps someone in Europe is listening to this and has kind  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:15:58):**  of strayed from the indigenous foods of their area as well.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:02):**  How can this kind of improve your health and your lifestyle at the same time.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:07):**  Well just the introduction of a lot more plant species in general I think is really important  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:11):**  for a diet you know because you know typically especially Americans probably less than 20  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:17):**  plant varietals on a given year just because they're buying the exact same things at the  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:21):**  grocery store over and over again.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:24):**  And I think it's just really important to connect with the nature around you and to  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:27):**  realize that this you know with these indigenous perspectives because we see this on a global  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:32):**  scale you know we see this especially where colonialism affected a lot of areas so almost  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:37):**  all of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, South America, Central  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:44):**  America we see the exact same story of you know this adverse effect of colonial powers  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:50):**  coming in and kind of forced assimilation happening in this kind of homogenizing situation  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:56):**  that happens with our food and our global food system in general.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:16:59):**  So we see reaching back to how indigenous people you know having that knowledge of thousands  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:05):**  of years of generational you know experience to live sustainably in your regions with the  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:11):**  seasons using very little is such important knowledge to you know just really be more  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:16):**  delicate and more connected to our area and our land and the soil and the plants around  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:22):**  us.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:23):**  And of course we're in a modern day and things have changed drastically over the past couple  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:26):**  hundred years.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:27):**  But now we still you know there still can be very useful knowledge to really start to  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:33):**  repair a lot of damage that has been done by this kind of colonial perspective of just  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:38):**  ripping resources out for monetary value and instead really look at how we can repair our  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:44):**  landscapes to really provide more food and health around us which is really what's most  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:49):**  important.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:50):**  Certainly, yeah.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:51):**  And for for anybody anywhere really I think the homogenization of how we plant cultivate  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:17:57):**  and sell food has limited our options not only for flavor profiles but for nutritional  
**[0:18:03-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:03):**  value and for plants that could have so many other benefits aside from their edibility  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:10):**  but also for restoring soil health erosion control health the health of waterways and  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:17):**  other sort of side benefits aside from from what they're intentionally planted for.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:23):**  Now let's get into that kind of more indulgent aspect of this this re initiation of food  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:30):**  culture.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:31):**  Let's talk about it from a flavor profile because I know many other talents you really  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:36):**  know your way around these ingredients in the kitchen.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:39):**  Can you talk about some of the lesser known ingredients that you've worked with and had  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:43):**  amazing results in reintroducing into a palate that hasn't experienced them in a while.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:50):**  You know we just you know really kept our eyes open as to what can we use like what  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:55):**  what is out there and what can we put on our plates.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:18:57):**  And as chefs it's fun to be able to experiment with all sorts of flavors and all sorts of  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:03):**  different techniques and how many ways can you play with these flavors and manipulate  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:08):**  a certain you know product to see how many different things to do with it.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:13):**  You know so and we really just try to make food taste like where we are so we can use  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:17):**  things like you know of course true wild rice where we are in our region is a huge staple.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:22):**  We have tons of wild ginger lots of wild like ramps and onions.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:26):**  We have lots of rose wild rose hips out there.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:30):**  We've got we use a lot of tree flavorings like tamarack.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:33):**  We use a lot of tree saps like the birch the box elder of course.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:38):**  And we have tons of berries and fruits are all over the place.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:43):**  And because we're living in this modern day there's just tons of invasive species that  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:48):**  are you know really useful because they are actually very edible.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:52):**  And we should be eating more of those especially some of them thrive and take over and we could  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:19:57):**  just be doing all sorts of cool stuff with these plants that you know are trying to take  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:02):**  over so much of these areas.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:05):**  So it's just being smart you know and it's fun to play with you know and we introduce  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:08):**  people to things like simple things like cedar and maple tea you know just using cedar bough  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:14):**  and sweeten it slightly with a little bit of pure maple and just showing people that  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:21):**  there's all these flavors around us and they really need to start seeing that you know.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:26):**  You know the first cookbook was just kind of an introduction of hoping that people would  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:29):**  start to think about the food right outside the back door and the history of land and  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:34):**  really paying respect to you know the land that we currently occupy and the indigenous  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:38):**  peoples who have lived there for generations before Europeans and how they were able to  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:43):**  survive survive sustainably for so long even you know very little again but doing it really  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:49):**  wisely.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:50):**  And so through the lens of cooking how has rediscovering the native foods and especially  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:20:56):**  the medicines which we haven't talked about as much so far can have so many more benefits  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:00):**  than than just like the nutrition in your diet.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:03):**  What else can it do for the health and understanding of the people the culture and the history  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:08):**  of a place.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:09):**  Well I think all indigenous communities around the world see food and medicine as basically  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:14):**  one you know so food is medicine and you know understanding these plants carry many values  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:20):**  like every plant has a purpose and you can find those purposes through edibility through  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:25):**  medicinal or just through crafting and you know also just like repair of the soil like  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:31):**  you said you can smartly put plants around to you know help an ecosystem develop them  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:36):**  into something stronger.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:38):**  So it's really slowly trying to piece all those pieces together you know and for us  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:43):**  you know we center everything around food and the culinary and the nutrition and the  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:48):**  health that comes through that but being very aware that there's all of these other properties  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:52):**  that these especially these plants you know carry and for us plants were really the key  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:21:58):**  to unlocking a lot of this knowledge like plant knowledge was power for us you know  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:02):**  because we use a lot of different proteins and stuff too but you know plants were really  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:07):**  where we started to learn and it's really where we need to focus as we move forward  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:11):**  in the future.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:13):**  Absolutely let's let's focus a little bit now on the work and the initiatives that you've  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:18):**  promoted through the nonprofit natives.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:22):**  Could you talk a little bit about how that organization was formed and what it aims to  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:26):**  achieve with local communities around North America.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:30):**  Well we see we saw the biggest needs out there around these foods and just getting native  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:37):**  foods out there everywhere.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:38):**  I mean we feel like there should be native restaurants all over the place because no  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:41):**  matter where you are in North America you're standing on indigenous land and you have giant  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:46):**  cities that are food capitals of the world.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:49):**  New York and Chicago and L.A. and zero Native American restaurants in those huge cities.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:54):**  So you know it just didn't make sense and plus you know a lot of these indigenous communities  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:22:58):**  across the board and these reservations have been suffering through you know perpetual  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:04):**  oppression for so long with extremely high poverty rates with extremely high you know  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:09):**  just health problems because of the food access that they have.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:13):**  So we wanted to really try to tackle that food access issue to try to impact the health  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:18):**  and to really get people excited about eating more traditional because these traditional  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:22):**  foods are so healthy because we cut out European ingredients like dairy, wheat flour, processed  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:27):**  cane sugar, even beef, pork and chicken to showcase all sorts of other things and it  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:32):**  became or it just happened to be an extremely healthy diet to eat that way.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:37):**  So we wanted to be able to get this out everywhere so we created the nonprofit natives which  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:42):**  is an acronym for North American traditional indigenous food system and what we're doing  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:47):**  is opening up a brand called Indigenous Food Lab which we're starting first off where we  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:53):**  are here in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:55):**  And the goal of the Food Lab is to be a live restaurant that has a classroom training kitchen  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:23:59):**  so we can offer indigenous education especially around food so we can build curriculum around  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:05):**  indigenous agriculture, seed keeping and saving, soil management, farming techniques, wild  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:10):**  foods, methomabotany, permaculture design, cooking techniques, food preservation, history,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:17):**  all of these pieces and just having some place that can focus just on indigenous education  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:23):**  is going to be extremely valuable and then using ourselves as this food lab to be able  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:28):**  to have people come in to train, to learn, even the restaurant has a training facility  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:32):**  so people can work alongside us so we can build skills.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:35):**  So their second goal is to work with the tribal communities directly around us to help them  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:41):**  to develop some kind of food entity for their own community that will really help spur and  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:45):**  impact health and create something that's particular to them, their tribe, their land,  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:50):**  their language and history and just kind of seeing the satellites pop up around us.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:24:56):**  And then our final goal is to take the indigenous food lab and to mimic it everywhere we can  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:01):**  so placing it in cities all across North America and it could be in Seattle, it could be in  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:06):**  Denver, you know we want to hit cities in Canada, we want to be up in Alaska, we want  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:10):**  to eventually be down in Mexico and really just be global role models and how we can  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:16):**  you know really impact community health through just having a place that promotes healthy  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:22):**  foods of the land and especially for the indigenous peoples.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:26):**  Tell me about a story where you have seen someone who perhaps was missing the connection  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:31):**  to their original culture sort of rediscover what is possible and the value of what their  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:38):**  culture has to bring even in the modern context through the education of food that you provide  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:44):**  both in your restaurant and with this organization.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:47):**  Well you know a lot of the cultures, a lot of the communities in the U.S., a lot of the  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:52):**  indigenous communities have lost a lot of their food ways you know especially I was  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:25:57):**  growing up on Pine Ridge and we saw Indian tacos as native foods which it is but you  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:03):**  know traditionally it hasn't been around that long so we pushed back against that notion  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:09):**  and you know we just kind of like there was no reason that Pride Bridge should identify  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:13):**  every single indigenous person all across the board because we were so diverse you know  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:18):**  throughout North America and you know we just really wanted to help bring these communities  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:23):**  back together so we've done a lot of work and been able to travel to lots of communities  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:27):**  to try to reintroduce like what is true, what are true native foods and what are true native  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:32):**  foods particularly to whichever region we might be in so we've been doing you know showcasing  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:37):**  and working with other tribes and doing dinners all over the place whether we're you know  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:42):**  way up in Washington State or you know doing foods to showcase like what would be indigenous  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:48):**  foods in Manhattan be or working with tribes in the Southwest or you know around us here  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:54):**  in Minnesota and just giving people, opening up a door for people to see that we can revitalize  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:26:59):**  and reintroduce and re-identify what our traditional foods are and you know evolve them into the  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:05):**  future so this becomes more of a modern thing but we see the need for it out there and we  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:11):**  see a lot of people really getting on board and we see a lot of movement because there's  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:15):**  other chefs out there around the country doing the same work. There's a lot of native seed  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:20):**  keepers helping communities grow out and find a lot of these cool feed bridles that are  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:26):**  very particular to some regions. We see a lot of academics pushing harder and further  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:32):**  into the importance of indigenous knowledge and our food systems and everything, our community  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:37):**  health in general. So there's an immense amount of demand out there and I think you know indigenous  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:43):**  people can really be role models of how we can live more sustainably using these knowledges  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:50):**  of the past. Yeah I completely agree. Now we explored just  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:27:55):**  a little while ago how this can affect the health of the earth around these areas as  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:00):**  well within the communities that we've talked about and en masse mostly because like from  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:06):**  a permaculture this perspective I think this knowledge of how to cultivate and reconnect  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:12):**  with native foods can be even more important than learning how to say for example grow  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:16):**  tomatoes or beef all over the world in places where they're not natively from. Talk about  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:22):**  what this could potentially do for the health of our landscapes and restoring the flora  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:29):**  and the fauna that have otherwise essentially been wiped out.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:33):**  Well I think we have plenty of data out there about damaging this monoculture situation.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:42):**  We are in a global state of how dangerous GMOs can be and are currently. We're basically  
**[0:28:50-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:28:50):**  giant lab experience to see what's going to happen with us after having all of this chemical  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:00):**  and modified organisms out there taking over so much of our landscape. I think it's just  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:07):**  going to be really important for people to realize that we can start to rebuild and revitalize  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:12):**  our soil and our health and our community through plants that are naturalized to our  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:17):**  area and have a lot more plant diversification which can bring on so much more. I feel like  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:24):**  it's starting to happen right now on this global scale because we've been able to be  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:28):**  at conferences with indigenous peoples from around the world who are all facing the same  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:33):**  problems and all starting to wake up and to kind of push forward to going back to a more  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:38):**  traditional way that really reconnects with the earth and repairs the earth. The indigenous  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:44):**  peoples are the original stewards of the landscape no matter where they are and it's important  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:48):**  to start to bring back again those lessons from the families.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:52):**  While we're on the topic of the land around the food systems and how it supports it I  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:29:57):**  know you've been traveling quite a bit doing research in native communities all through  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:02):**  North America for an upcoming book. Can you talk a little bit about how some of these  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:06):**  traditions and cultures have reflected the type of micro climates or macro climates and  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:13):**  soil conditions and ecosystems where they were primarily primarily located and what  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:19):**  you've learned in interacting with those. Well you know part of it is just we feel like  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:25):**  we're just starting in a lot of places especially around here in the US and in Canada too because  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:31):**  we during the 1800s many areas of North America went through such drastic change with complete  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:38):**  deforestation happening in many areas of just the introduction of barbed wire fences and  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:45):**  cutting off the natural paths of wild animals returning the soil and plants to introduction  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:51):**  of massive amounts of cattle and other plant species that aren't natural to our region  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:30:56):**  and just so much change on such a massive scale. So but we see you know certain little  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:02):**  groups here and there starting to really trying to turn that backwards and go back to a time  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:08):**  when they are being a lot more aware of you know how the soil originally was the animals  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:14):**  that were there and seeing what they can do. I mean it's going to be a lot of work and  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:18):**  a lot of effort to make this happen but we see the indigenous tribes as being a really  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:24):**  great place to start because they have you know this you know they have sovereignty basically  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:30):**  in many of these areas to make the decisions to go ahead and start doing this in their  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:34):**  own right. So we just hope we're hoping that these indigenous communities can start to  
**[0:31:39-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:39):**  be you know role models again of how to really push for that and how to really make that  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:46):**  change happen. So I find this so inspiring especially as  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:51):**  I've seen smaller efforts of this type in the indigenous communities that I've worked  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:31:55):**  with and lived around here mostly in Central America. But even when I actually when my  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:32:00):**  family first came from Japan to the United States we spent about six months living near  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:32:07):**  a native reservation in western Wisconsin and that was some of my first introduction  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:32:12):**  to the United States. I think this work is amazingly important.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:32:17):**  Can you tell our listeners how they can get in touch with you your organizations and how  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:32:21):**  they might be able to help support this initiative.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:32:23):**  Yeah well people can always check out our website so they can go to C-SHEF.com and it's

**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:33:11):**  more when I get back to Minnesota to visit my brothers. I'd love to see not only the  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:33:15):**  restaurant but hopefully visit some of the communities out there as well and learn more  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:33:19):**  about this when I get the chance to get out there again.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-sean-sherman/#t=0:33:22):**  Thanks for having me. It's my pleasure. You take care.

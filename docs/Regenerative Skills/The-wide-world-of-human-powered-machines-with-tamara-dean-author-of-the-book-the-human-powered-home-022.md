**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:23):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:26):**  My guest today is Tamra Dean, the author of the book The Human Powered Home, Choosing  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:30):**  Muscles Over Motors, which is an in-depth look at the history, advancement, and modern  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:35):**  applications of human powered machines.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:38):**  Having just finished reading this, I can honestly say that I was immediately inspired to start  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:42):**  building and using these machines myself.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:45):**  It covers the full range of people powered devices from treadle sewing machines, prisoner  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:49):**  powered treadmills, and cotton gins, to bicycles, seesaw water pumps, and pedal generators.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:01:55):**  In later chapters, Tamra profiles people in organizations that are applying human powered  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:00):**  devices to appropriate technologies that stimulate economies in developing regions, empower people  
**[0:02:05-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:05):**  to take on new projects on their own steam, and even just improve your health and fitness.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:12):**  In this interview, Tamra talks about her inspiration to write The Human Powered Home and some of  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:16):**  the machines she built herself while researching for this book.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:20):**  She also gives advice on some of the most efficient and less efficient tasks to power  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:25):**  on your own, some of which are based on her own successes and failures.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:30):**  But rather than giving it all away, I'll turn things now over to Tamra.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:34):**  Tamra, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:36):**  How are you?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:37):**  I'm doing well, Oliver.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:38):**  Thanks for having me on.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:40):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:42):**  I've got a whole ton of things that I want to ask you, especially after reading your  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:45):**  book.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:46):**  So what do you say we just jump right on in?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:49):**  That sounds great.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:50):**  Alright, so tell me a little bit about your background and how you started to get interested  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:55):**  in providing for your own needs and consumption.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:02:58):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:00):**  I have such a varied background.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:02):**  I started out in engineering in college.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:05):**  I wound my way through communications and writing, and then I ended up working in the  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:10):**  dot com business in IT for several years as an engineer and also writing textbooks on  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:16):**  computer networking for college students.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:19):**  But meanwhile, I was very interested in living more sustainably and living out my environmental  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:24):**  principles.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:25):**  My partner David is also an engineer and loves to tinker, so we bought this property in southwestern  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:32):**  Wisconsin, which is just a gorgeous place.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:36):**  In case you ever feel inspired to visit, I highly recommend it.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:40):**  And we thought that we would try and end at building our own house, growing our own food  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:46):**  and trying some alternative energy techniques.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:50):**  So we first built a straw bale workshop or shed kind of building.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:03:56):**  And we needed some way to mix the plaster for the exterior of the straw bales so that  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:02):**  they wouldn't rot in the elements.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:04):**  We had started mixing the plaster in a stock tank, basically a trough by foot, but this  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:11):**  was really taking forever.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:14):**  So we found this old cement mixer at an auction and its motor had died.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:20):**  We also found this exercise bike on a neighbor's lawn and she said, yeah, take it, have it  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:24):**  for free.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:26):**  And we combined the two with some pulleys and belts and we created a pedal powered cement  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:31):**  mixer to mix the plaster for our straw bale building.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:34):**  And that was really the beginning of all our experimentation with human powered devices.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:40):**  You know, a lot of people think that human power will be a great way to not only get  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:45):**  things done, but have a good workout.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:47):**  And it often is, but you know, I wouldn't recommend it for long term efforts like mixing  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:54):**  all your cement for a huge project or washing all your clothes that way.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:04:59):**  It does have some limitations.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:01):**  But we tried many different machines and feel free to ask me about any of those that you  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:06):**  found in the book.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:08):**  Excellent, I plan to.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:09):**  I love that story of your mixing machine sort of being the gateway to experimentation and  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:16):**  toying around with what else would be possible to power on your own efforts.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:21):**  Yeah, and I have to say that that little exercise bike was not designed for a cement mixer.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:27):**  So right about as soon as our project ended, one of its welded joints gave out and that  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:33):**  was the end of the pedal powered cement mixer.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:37):**  But we did, as I say, experiment with several other things.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:40):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:42):**  Now as you were saying earlier, your fields of study and your work don't seem to line  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:47):**  up nicely with the self-sustainable lifestyle, but I'm betting that there are a lot of overlaps  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:52):**  in your engineering skills and what you've applied to your property and your lifestyle.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:05:56):**  Could you talk a little about how those skills transferred over and what you learned for  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:00):**  yourself to get where you are now?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:02):**  Yeah, you know I would say the number one benefit that I've had, whether it's by nature  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:10):**  or nurture, is just this insatiable curiosity.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:13):**  So I love learning about not only technology but also the natural world, the arts.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:20):**  So I went into mechanical and material science engineering as a student in my undergrad years.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:26):**  And I learned about the properties of materials as well as how to put things together in the  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:33):**  best possible ways, you know, strengths and strains and forces.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:37):**  But I didn't actually apply that in my job later as I worked in computer networking.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:44):**  That's probably obvious.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:45):**  There aren't too many stresses and strains physically in that business.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:50):**  But I did maintain curiosity.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:52):**  And I also really enjoyed both through my engineering career and then I later got a  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:06:58):**  master's degree in writing.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:00):**  I enjoyed translating concepts that seemed somewhat difficult to get at a first glance  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:08):**  into really, really understandable ways.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:12):**  So when I came to try to describe the human powered devices, I was able to combine my  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:18):**  curiosity, my engineering and mechanical abilities and my ability to communicate.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:24):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:25):**  Now, you told me how you sort of got started researching human powered machines.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:31):**  Where were some of the main resources that you looked to and some of the most inspirational  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:36):**  applications that really got you started building your own?  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:41):**  There weren't many references out there, which is why I proposed the book to New Society  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:47):**  publishers and they jumped at it.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:49):**  In fact, they said, we've been wanting to have a book like this for years, but we haven't  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:52):**  found anyone to write it.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:07:54):**  So there were a few books on bicycles and how bicycles are powered and what you might  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:02):**  be able to do with bike machines, but they were very outdated.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:07):**  And I really just did a ton of research from the history of human power all the way back  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:13):**  to the treadmills that were used for prisoners to the people who were employing them today,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:19):**  not only in the US, but also in other countries where oftentimes they feel a necessary need.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:27):**  They're not just a novelty as they often are in the US.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:31):**  For example, in Guatemala, bicycle powered machines can mill grain or mix shampoos or  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:38):**  smoothies and oftentimes they form the basis for a small business.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:44):**  In some countries in Africa, the Marigoround is used as a water pump and this enables a  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:51):**  whole village to get clean water where they hadn't been able to have clean water before.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:08:56):**  So I went from engineer to engineer, just did a lot of interviews and learned both about  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:03):**  the science behind human power and the practical applications today.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:08):**  And I feel like the human powered home is a compendium of all the greatest hits of what  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:14):**  I discovered through my research.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:16):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:17):**  The compilation of all those things really gives a fantastic overview of some of the  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:23):**  options that are out there and even previews a lot of ways that human powered machines  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:28):**  were used throughout history.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:31):**  On that note, could you explain some of the more common machines that came about maybe  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:35):**  in the last century or two or even further back that were integral to the development  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:40):**  of certain areas of the world?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:42):**  Yeah, I would say that naturally the bicycle is the one that comes to mind because a bicycle  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:50):**  is actually the most efficient way of turning muscle power into mechanics.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:09:57):**  But also the treadled machines of the late 19th century and early 20th century before  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:05):**  everybody had electricity were vital both in industry and at home.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:12):**  Many of us know that our great grandmothers used a treadle powered sewing machine and  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:18):**  these were so common and it was something you would find in every household.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:22):**  But also on the other side the shops, wood shops, always had treadle powered scroll saws  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:31):**  or other kinds of machinery.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:33):**  So they were important for a shop that didn't have the means to use a large steam powered  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:41):**  engine, for example, that ran central access with belts to every different machine.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:47):**  Yeah, I've seen some of the designs from the book and frankly I want to get my hands on  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:52):**  some of those now.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:53):**  I wish they were still in production but there are resources like you said that you can find  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:10:57):**  either for plans to build your own or possibly even get antique human powered machines that  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:04):**  still work or maybe just need some minor repairs.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:07):**  Yeah, there definitely are and it's not like today where you're not going to be able to  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:13):**  find a way to fix something.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:17):**  Because they're mechanical they are fixable unlike maybe a computerized device that will  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:23):**  be obsolete and unfixable within 10 or 15 years.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:28):**  Yeah that's a great point.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:29):**  When you go back to simpler machines it gives so many more opportunities to not only fix  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:36):**  and repair them yourself without having to rely on either the manufacturer or someone  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:41):**  else which gives you a little bit more sense of personal autonomy but it also opens up  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:46):**  the possibilities for alterations and even improvements that you can make yourself.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:51):**  Exactly, that's right.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:52):**  You can customize those machines to whatever you need.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:11:55):**  And in the case of human power it might be a matter of adding gears or different sized  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:00):**  pulleys to adjust to your ability to power them.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:03):**  We all have different levels of strength and endurance.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:07):**  Of course, yeah.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:09):**  The obvious application are bikes going uphill or going downhill and you change based on  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:13):**  the resistance but you could apply that exact same principle to variant loads on say an  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:19):**  alternator or generator or maybe an increase in strain in some other type of machine like  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:26):**  a pump.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:29):**  So tell me a bit about some of your personal successes and failures in experimenting with  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:34):**  these human powered machines.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:36):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:37):**  I would say that you know when I went into researching human powered machines I didn't  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:43):**  have a sense for how much power was necessary to accomplish a certain task.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:49):**  So the pedal powered cement mixer was very difficult and that kind of made sense.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:12:56):**  We use a hand cranked coffee mill at home and I was pretty shocked at how easy that  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:01):**  is.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:02):**  You know I think of that loud whirring noise that the electric coffee mills make and you  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:08):**  think wow they're really working hard but it's almost no effort at all to mill your  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:13):**  own coffee.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:15):**  One thing we use quite a bit at home is the pedal powered or hand cranked grain mill and  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:20):**  that too is quite easy.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:22):**  It takes a little bit of time but I have to say after growing my own flint corn which  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:28):**  is the kind of corn used for flour or cornmeal and also getting the wheat berries at the  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:34):**  store I think that freshly milled flour makes such a difference in taste in whatever recipe  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:41):**  you're using it in.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:42):**  So that's one of my favorites to use at home.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:45):**  One that was not so much of a success and I do mention this in a book and is the pedal  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:53):**  powered washing machine.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:13:55):**  As I said before that is a big load not to use a pun but that's a large task to try to  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:04):**  accomplish through your leg muscles.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:07):**  In between the very easy coffee mill and the very difficult washing machine are pedal powered  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:15):**  electrical generators and those are described their plans in the book and there are also  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:21):**  references for off the shelf pedal powered electrical generators that you can buy.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:28):**  But it's somewhere in between and the thing to remember about human power is that we often  
**[0:14:34-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:34):**  are able to generate more power in the beginning of our effort whereas after 10 or 15 minutes  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:42):**  our level of output will plateau at a more modest amount.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:48):**  And compared to a lot of other energy sources like gasoline or the electricity that comes  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:54):**  out of the wall you know human power is pretty modest.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:14:59):**  So I guess I would recommend that people start with the easier machines and see how that  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:04):**  feels to them.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:06):**  Speaking of some of those easier machines I know you mentioned milling your own grain  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:12):**  and I don't know have you had much experience with like making smoothies or other blender  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:17):**  products things like that.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:19):**  Are there anything that you would really recommend for people who maybe already have the electronic  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:25):**  version but could get comparable or even better results by switching to pedal power or other  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:31):**  human powered versions.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:33):**  Yeah you mentioned the pedal powered blender and that's a device that I interviewed a few  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:41):**  people about in addition to making their own at home and using those for smoothies.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:45):**  It works quite well but what I hadn't realized before I tried it out and talked with people  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:50):**  was that it actually might work better than the electrical clients because in one case  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:15:57):**  a chef was telling me that as long as he pedal powered the blender that he used to make sauces  
**[0:16:03-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:03):**  and chutneys for example he could tell exactly by the resistance to his effort whether the  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:11):**  product was ready and finished and then he would stop before he went any farther.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:17):**  Similarly Frederick Breeden who makes Just Soap with a pedal powered blender and it's  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:23):**  quite an elaborate machine it's pictured in the book he said that soap will actually spoil  
**[0:16:29-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:29):**  after you mix it too much so you have to stop right before that turning point and by pedaling  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:37):**  his blender he was able to feel when it was ready to stop whereas with an electrical device  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:44):**  he would have had to keep testing and checking the viscosity but with his muscles he could  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:50):**  tell when it was ready and I thought that was a pretty neat revelation.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:16:55):**  I agree that almost puts an artistic element into using your own power to make things that  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:00):**  you wouldn't get from either electrical appliances or other that don't allow you to interact  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:06):**  with the process nearly as much.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:09):**  Exactly and it really points to a theme I came across through all of my investigation  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:15):**  and interviews having to do with pedal powered devices which was empowerment.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:19):**  You know when people pedal power their own lights for example or in the case of a band  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:28):**  they pedal power their own stereo system for a concert they feel empowered like okay we're  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:36):**  doing this ourselves we're managing without the grid we are self-sufficient and this is  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:42):**  sustainable and it really gets poignant when they're eating while they're pedaling so it's  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:48):**  really a complete cycle in view.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:50):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:51):**  Now I wanted to talk about one of the other things you mentioned earlier about how someone's  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:17:56):**  input can either plateau or taper off over time and one of the things that I really appreciated  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:01):**  that you included in that book were tables that sort of correlated to different machines  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:06):**  and what you could realistically expect an average person to put out as far as energy  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:12):**  or as far as work done in the beginning of their efforts as they went over a longer period  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:18):**  of time and you know even some that were not hard enough to operate that you could kind  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:23):**  of do it in an unlimited amount of time depending on the application.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:29):**  That apply I guess adding sort of a realistic expectation aspect of this I think will really  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:35):**  help people to sort of size what they are likely to be able to apply for their own needs  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:41):**  and for their own applications and not be sort of disillusioned when maybe they try  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:46):**  something out and it's a lot harder than they thought or their their personal output is  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:50):**  far below what they expected.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:52):**  Right.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:18:53):**  In addition I think it will help people choose the device that they want to power for instance  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:01):**  I wrote part of the book while pedal powering the laptop I was writing on and laptops really  
**[0:19:07-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:07):**  don't take that much electricity they're pretty low wattage so you can power a laptop for  
**[0:19:15-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:15):**  hours with you know a bike and a stand or a recumbent bike exercise bike attached to  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:23):**  a motor generator.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:24):**  But if you were to try to do that same hour or two hours of typing with a desktop computer  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:31):**  or something a little fancier and more high powered it would be quite difficult so I hope  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:37):**  that chart helps people choose what they're going to power with their muscles.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:43):**  I'm glad you brought up sort of the wattage output that someone can make.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:47):**  I know a lot of people including myself before I read your book are interested in seeing  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:51):**  how much electricity they can generate with their efforts.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:54):**  So what would you say are the best ways of doing this and would you recommend other ways  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:19:59):**  of using your efforts for a greater return?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:02):**  Oh that's a great question.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:05):**  You know the human body if you're a reasonably fit reasonably young person you can manage  
**[0:20:11-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:11):**  to generate at least 75 maybe 100 watts for an hour or so and that's certainly enough  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:20):**  to power a laptop or even at that level a desktop computer.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:27):**  But you have to bear in mind that that's probably still about a pennies worth of electricity  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:33):**  from the electric company so if you're looking to save money that's not necessarily a great  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:38):**  reason to do it if you just want to feel empowered and if you want to be self-sufficient if you're  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:45):**  off grid then those are great reasons to take it on.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:50):**  I think that's an important thing to point out is that you know we live in a very fortunate  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:20:55):**  time where electricity especially and other forms of power are incredibly cheap and so  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:01):**  if you're just looking at sort of a cost saving analysis this doesn't necessarily pan out  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:07):**  but the other aspects of empowerment and self-reliance are really where the returns start to come  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:13):**  in.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:14):**  I agree and you know there are a lot of pedal powered machine displays for kids and I think  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:23):**  that's a pretty good use of human power as well.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:28):**  You might go to an energy fair and you'll see a bike powered electrical generator hooked  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:33):**  up to multiple devices that kids can work on so they might see that pedal powering an  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:40):**  incandescent light bulb takes so much more work than pedal powering a compact fluorescent  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:46):**  which takes even more work than pedal powering an LED light bulb and then if you try to pedal  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:52):**  power a hair dryer for example it might be impossible for a kid and maybe even an adult  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:58):**  to do that.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:21:59):**  So you begin to understand how much you're relying on the grid and how much electricity  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:04):**  you're using without even thinking about the work that went into it.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:09):**  Yeah that was one of my biggest takeaways from this book as well other than being inspired  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:13):**  by all the different plans and applications.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:16):**  I've done research about this in the past for articles that I've written and possibly  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:20):**  even a book that I'm thinking of writing on sort of what you can realistically expect  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:26):**  to produce within a home everything from food to energy to heating and in auditing sort  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:33):**  of what appliances and what applications in the home require the most energy you start  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:39):**  to get an idea of what your actions and your comfort levels are really starting to cost  
**[0:22:44-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:44):**  and understanding these as a measure of human energy output is another great way to sort  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:52):**  of measure just exactly how much each of these appliances use.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:22:57):**  Right and you might choose after exploring this to redesign your home or create more  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:03):**  passive solar so that you get light from outdoors instead of having to turn on light bulbs and  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:09):**  you have thicker more better insulated walls on your home so that you're not using the  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:14):**  air conditioner as much in the summer.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:17):**  Yeah that was definitely the impact that I had on me.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:19):**  Now I wanted to touch on something that you sort of briefly mentioned earlier and that's  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:24):**  sort of the I know that the scope of what one can do with pedal power or treadle power  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:29):**  and others is really astounding and could you give a few more examples of places and  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:34):**  applications in which these forms of machines are much more than just a novelty but actually  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:39):**  a way of life and a major part of the economic activity where they're used.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:44):**  Sure I did mention the pedal powered bike machines in Guatemala as I said they can form  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:51):**  the basis for small businesses or they can you know shell nuts they can grind grain they  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:23:58):**  can blend smoothies but in other countries for example in Nepal there's a great project  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:24:06):**  that helps people collectively create and store electricity they have a bike powered  
**[0:24:13-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:24:13):**  electrical generator in the square and people from farther out can run their six volt motorcycle  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:24:21):**  type that has to the square they pedal power enough to charge those six volt batteries  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:24:27):**  they take them home and they will power the LED lights that children need in the evenings  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:24:33):**  to do their homework by and that prevents the family from having to burn kerosene lamps  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:24:39):**  in their small homes which could be you know air quality hazard.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:24:44):**  I think that's a great example of using pedal power in an essential way also in some countries  
**[0:24:52-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:24:52):**  in India in Africa and in India they use treadle powered water pumps to get water to their  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:00):**  crops and in this way they can actually extend their growing season or add a whole another  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:06):**  growing season to you know improve their bottom line as farmers.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:12):**  I can say that that was probably the first application where I was really struck that  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:16):**  people are still using these technologies to good effect when I was doing projects in  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:21):**  West Africa I saw a couple of these human powered pumps for water and they're in good  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:26):**  use you know they are quite a lifeline to the communities that they serve.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:32):**  Yeah and also as we mentioned before with the treadle powered devices from the 19th  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:38):**  century in the US they're more you know fixable by the average person than say a tractor that's  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:45):**  imported from far away and you might not be able to find parts and you might not have  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:49):**  the understanding because it's so complex to be able to fix it and then it'll sit there  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:25:54):**  and rust and not bring any value to your farm so sometimes a simpler kind of pump is really  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:01):**  an asset.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:02):**  Exactly I really agree and that really adds on to the empowerment aspect of these types  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:07):**  of machines.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:08):**  Now do you see much innovation these days in the realm of human powered devices and  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:14):**  if so what are some of the things that you're excited to see become available?  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:18):**  Yeah that's a great question and when I was finishing the book a lot of people especially  
**[0:26:25-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:25):**  in the US and in Europe were interested in energy harvesting through just everyday movements  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:34):**  so there were for example fibers that were woven into clothing that would harness the  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:39):**  energy just as you moved about your day so that it could be stored in a small battery  
**[0:26:44-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:44):**  and later perhaps used to light something or to power an electronic gadget.  
**[0:26:51-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:26:51):**  Basically this passive energy harvesting was attempted through supply to the military.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:00):**  The military is very interested in human power because a lot of personnel are in places where  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:06):**  they're not connected to a grid they might be out in the middle of nowhere but they still  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:10):**  need their GPS and communications devices to work.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:14):**  It was found however that using the energy harvesting device in the sole of a boot made  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:22):**  walking much more difficult after a while the soldier would tire and it's not surprising  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:29):**  because you don't get something for nothing.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:32):**  There's certainly a law that we have to follow in physics that says if you expend the energy  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:38):**  you're going to feel like you expend the energy and you can't collect energy without feeling  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:42):**  that.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:43):**  So those are the directions in which human power innovation has been occurring in the  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:50):**  US.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:51):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:52):**  Now for those of my listeners who want to get started using and even making their own  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:27:57):**  people powered machines or human powered machines what do you think is the most versatile or  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:03):**  practical options that are available to them?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:06):**  Well I would begin with you know consider boning up on your understanding of how bicycles  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:15):**  work.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:16):**  As I said before the bicycle as a machine is the most efficient way of harnessing and  
**[0:28:22-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:22):**  using human energy and once you have that basic understanding you can modify it in many  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:30):**  ways to power many different machines.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:34):**  You know you can connect directly to a pulley or a different kind of drive to run a blender  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:43):**  to make smoothies or you could run some shop equipment or the grain grinder.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:50):**  This is a good place to start and I have to say that we were pretty successful in finding  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:28:56):**  all the parts we needed from salvage stores and it often didn't cost much at all and then  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:02):**  we would make up for you know if we needed additional parts we would go to the hardware  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:06):**  store but it still was very economical.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:11):**  Wonderful now before I let you go I want to thank you so much for an inspiring and persuasive  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:16):**  chat but could you also tell our listeners how they can get a copy of your book The Human  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:20):**  Powered Home and find out more about your other publications.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:25):**  Yeah The Human Powered Home is published by New Society Publishers and you can go to www.newsociety.com  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:32):**  or purchase it wherever you like to purchase books.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:38):**  My other books are computer networking textbooks also available wherever you purchase books  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:44):**  and I have a website where I've published several essays and stories.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:50):**  The essays often have to do with environmental topics as well as articles.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:29:55):**  I'm interested in clean and abundant water in Wisconsin with all of our farming that's  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:00):**  in consideration right now.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:03):**  My website is www.tamaradine.media.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:09):**  Excellent well thank you so much for taking the time Tamara it's been a real pleasure  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:12):**  talking to you.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:13):**  I hope we can do maybe a follow up sometime because I'd love to ask you some more questions  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:17):**  about the homes that you built and the lifestyle that you live which really sort of falls in  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:23):**  line with the ethics and the ideas that I try to promote through this podcast.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:28):**  That sounds great Oliver thanks for having me on.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:31):**  It's my pleasure take care.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:33):**  You too.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:35):**  Now let's quickly jump into this week's weekly tip which I'd like to call expanding your  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:40):**  boundaries.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:41):**  Now this is a topic that comes up a lot in talks between me and Neil Haggerty one of  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:46):**  my good friends and a permaculture and regenerative farm designer here at Abundant Edge.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:51):**  We've observed that one of the most limiting factors that we've noticed from people who  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:30:55):**  come here and try to set up permaculture landscapes and gardens is that they're often intent on  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:00):**  growing the same foods that they've grown accustomed to in the US or Europe or wherever  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:04):**  else in the world they come from.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:07):**  Vegetables that are staples in a western diet like carrots, salad greens, tomatoes and others  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:12):**  will certainly grow here in the high tropics of Guatemala and they even get very excited  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:16):**  when they find out about the extended growing season that's available here to us.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:21):**  And none of these food crops are native to the area and frankly need a lot more care  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:25):**  and help in this environment than perhaps in northern and temperate climates.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:30):**  That isn't to say that these people are doing anything wrong, in fact I'll always support  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:34):**  anyone who is looking to create their own food security and care for the land in the  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:38):**  process.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:40):**  The observations that Neil and I made was that there's an incredible range of local  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:44):**  fruits and vegetables that while relatively unknown in the western diet not only grow  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:50):**  much more easily here and are better suited to the climate and soil conditions of the  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:54):**  region, but as a result likely end up with a better nutrient profile for having grown  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:31:59):**  up in their native habitat.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:02):**  I'm talking about plants like malanga, better known as taro root, tree tomatoes, yucca,  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:07):**  chia, moranaranjillo berries, amaranth and so many more.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:13):**  These plants grow abundantly here, even in the rocky soil and steep slopes of the mountains  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:17):**  in this terrain, but because of the globalization of food and the homogenization of our diets,  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:23):**  even locals have switched to farming crops that are tougher to cultivate, but fetch a  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:27):**  better wholesale price in export markets.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:30):**  In this case, when I refer to expanding your boundaries, I'm talking about being open to  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:35):**  changing your regular diet when you travel or settle in a new place.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:40):**  While you may be more accustomed to certain foods that grow easily or are simply easier  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:44):**  to find in the region where you came from, expanding your comfort zone to include the  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:49):**  foods that are indigenous and best suited to the growing environment of where you are  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:53):**  now will not only open your world to some incredible cuisine that is likely not industrially  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:32:59):**  farmed and much healthier for you, but could little by little help to change the landscape  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:33:04):**  of food and agriculture back to a culturally and regionally unique experience.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:33:10):**  If you're interested in hearing more great ideas and observations from Neil, the awesome  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tamara-dean/#t=0:33:15):**  episode that I recorded with him is number 13 on the Abundant Edge playlist.

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 07:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:40):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:18):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:20):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:24):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:40):**  Hey everyone, so since the last two episodes focused on earthworks, specifically water  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:45):**  retention and catchment features, I wanted to revisit one of my favorite interviews that  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:50):**  really helped me to understand the fundamentals of keyline design and how many different configurations  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:54):**  it could take, even on the same piece of land.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:01:57):**  Now the keyline system was pioneered, of course, by PA Yeomans in Australia back in the 1950s,  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:04):**  and has been a guide for farmers and land restorationists ever since.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:08):**  Back at the beginning of this season, I spoke with Mark Shepherd, right after the release  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:11):**  of his latest book, Water for Any Farm, which is a culmination of decades of work on his  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:16):**  own property, as well as consulting and designing for others around the US and the world.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:22):**  Now Mark's no-nonsense approach to permaculture and restoration agriculture have been attractive  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:26):**  to me since I first got interested in these topics more than a decade ago.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:30):**  In this interview, we start by talking about how the mismanagement of land and water has  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:35):**  created the conditions that we have today all over the world where topsoil is constantly  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:40):**  eroded and water quickly becomes a destructive force rather than a rejuvenating one if it's  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:45):**  left to run over bare landscapes.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:48):**  Mark goes into a lot of detail to describe how to read your landscape and identify key  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:52):**  points that can be used as references for keylines to direct water all across your land  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:02:57):**  in a way that slows it down, spreads it out, and then rehydrates the soil.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:02):**  We talk about what machinery and tools he recommends for major earthworks, the installation  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:07):**  of different types of ponds, building soil over large acreage, and much more.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:12):**  Now I'm lucky to get sent a lot of books to look over and review before speaking with  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:16):**  authors, and I often unfortunately don't have time to read them very thoroughly, but  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:20):**  Mark's latest book Water for Any Farm is one that I really took the time to understand  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:25):**  because of the incredible potential that this system has for increasing the productivity  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:29):**  and resilience of any landscape, not just from an agricultural perspective.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:34):**  Now adjusting the water harvesting capacity of your terrain can have an important impact  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:38):**  on any kind of regeneration project and help with weathering severe climate events as well.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:44):**  This is especially relevant to reforestation and agroforestry because the earthworks method  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:49):**  outlined in the book is how Mark was able to regenerate a degraded farm surrounded by  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:53):**  monoculture corn crops into the highly productive oak-savanna mimicking ecosystem based around  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:03:59):**  the pillars of hazelnut and chestnut orchards.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:01):**  I highly recommend that you check it out.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:03):**  I've put the links to where you can get the book and learn more about Mark and his work  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:07):**  in the show notes for this episode on the website.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:10):**  So now I'll hand things back once again to Mark Shepherd.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:13):**  Hey, Mark, thanks so much for taking the time to be on the show again.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:17):**  It's a real pleasure to talk to you.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:18):**  How have you been?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:19):**  Hey, been doing pretty well yourself, Oliver.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:21):**  Thanks for having me on.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:22):**  Yeah, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:23):**  I've been doing real well and I'm super excited.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:25):**  First of all, congratulations on the release of your new book Water for Any Farm.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:30):**  And I know in southwestern Wisconsin where your farm is, it's known as an area that's  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:35):**  got quite a bit of water through rainfall and isn't considered like arid or water scarce.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:41):**  So what inspired you to focus an entire book on water?  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:44):**  Well, the book on water, Water for Any Farm, is the focus of this one.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:51):**  It's actually part of an overall restoration agriculture series.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:04:57):**  Restoration Agriculture, my first book, explained how New Forest Farm was designed to imitate  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:03):**  a natural plant community type, the oak savanna, and convert agricultural production from annual  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:11):**  cropping to perennial cropping using those plant communities as the template.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:16):**  Well, the first thing we wanted to do is manage the water so that even though southwest Wisconsin  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:24):**  gets a decent amount of rain, about 30 inches a meter, thereabouts, of rain per year, there  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:30):**  are times when it goes without.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:32):**  So it was one year, I went completely without rain.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:35):**  On the second year, I went almost the whole year without rain.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:38):**  And so I wanted to make sure that we had adequate water stored in ponds and in the soil.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:46):**  And another example is Middle Tennessee and Kentucky this past calendar year, 2019, two  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:52):**  times the normal rainfall amount, like 80 inches, somewhat 80 inches of rain.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:05:57):**  However, in the middle of this year where they're getting twice the annual rainfall,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:01):**  they had the longest dry spell in history.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:05):**  And so they actually had the biggest drought ever, even though they had twice the rain.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:09):**  Well, so if we're having twice the rain and having these long dry spells, the water was  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:15):**  there for continued agricultural production if it was captured, delivered to a place,  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:22):**  stored, soaked into the soil, et cetera.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:25):**  And it seems like we're starting to move towards this larger trend of heavier rainfall events  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:30):**  followed by larger droughts as the climate starts to shift and is affected by human intervention.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:37):**  So this is all the more important to really set up these systems that can make best use  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:43):**  of these massive events in order to kind of draw them out and create access throughout  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:49):**  the landscape when the dry spells also occur.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:53):**  So with that in mind, let's start by talking a little bit about how the agricultural techniques  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:06:58):**  of settlers moving west in the US after colonization quickly started to deplete the immense fertility  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:05):**  of these savannah lands, like a perfect example of where you're located.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:09):**  Yeah, well, the agricultural techniques of the first European settlers were all based  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:15):**  and derived around growing annual grain crops for human consumption for livestock feed,  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:22):**  which required eliminating the perennial ecology that was in place.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:28):**  If it was forested, like in the east, it was clear cut, then the stumps ripped out and  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:33):**  burned and then the ground was plowed, which exposed it to the rain and to the wind, so  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:38):**  the soil began to wash away.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:40):**  It didn't have the natural perennial system rebuilding the soil after it was originally  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:47):**  oxidized by plowing and then, like I said, eroded away with wind and rain.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:52):**  Same with the savannas and same with the prairies and, of course, same in the arid, more drier  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:57):**  areas.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:07:58):**  So, basically, it was clearing of land in order to plow to grow annual crops and the  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:05):**  big two monsters in the upper Midwest anyways, the whole central US, is corn and beans.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:09):**  Those are the biggest ones in the Midwest.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:11):**  Yeah, it's a shame that so many of these techniques continue until today.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:16):**  One of the things that you mentioned early on in the book is how some fairly enlightened  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:21):**  early policymakers for American agricultural policy started to shift towards a smarter  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:28):**  way of managing these landscapes to reduce the amount of erosion and soil depletion that  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:33):**  was going on.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:34):**  But you're trying to take a few steps forward to not just minimizing the loss, but actually  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:40):**  start to regain the fertility and the resilience of these landscapes.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:44):**  So as you state in chapter two, this book was written for professional agriculturalists  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:49):**  and the language and the terms are really meant to help alternative farmers to communicate  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:55):**  with government officials.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:08:57):**  Could you elaborate a little on why it's necessary to be able to do that?  
**[0:09:01-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:01):**  Well, you had kind of touched on it a little bit, but everybody who is involved with growing  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:09):**  things on the ground, we have our own language, we come from our own background of describing  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:14):**  how we deal with water, the whole permaculture side of things, which is where I came from  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:19):**  before I got into large-scale farming, uses a different set of language words than the  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:26):**  that farmers use, which is a different set of words than civil engineers and stormwater  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:31):**  managers use, which is a different set of words than what army corps of engineers used  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:36):**  and so on.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:37):**  And no matter where we go, we have different levels of government authority.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:43):**  Some of it is hard authority, they will arrest you if you do things incorrectly.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:48):**  Some of it is permitting authority, some of it is more of a soft authority, such as with  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:53):**  the USDA best management practices and their agricultural codes.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:09:58):**  So what we need to do is we need to be able to grow, farm, whatever we're farming, so  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:06):**  we need to have our water managed somehow.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:09):**  Well, we as the people actually growing food for sale, etc., we need to be able to use  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:15):**  language that describes what we do so that these various different governing officials  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:20):**  understand what we're doing.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:22):**  And from the opposite side, of course, we have to understand what are the different  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:27):**  rules that we have to comply with.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:29):**  I was just in a workshop two days ago where there was a fellow from Washington State,  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:36):**  and it's a water rights state, which means somebody owns the raindrops that falls on  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:40):**  your farm.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:41):**  That sounds perverse to me.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:43):**  And they were, he's not allowed to store water in anything like a container or a pond at  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:50):**  all.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:51):**  So how do you accomplish the objectives of having that rainfall be effective in your  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:10:57):**  landscape and not be stored in a liquid form in a container or a pond?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:04):**  And so we need to be able to comply with these rules of wherever we are and yet still be  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:12):**  able to harvest our own rainwater, distribute it around our own farm and have it stored  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:17):**  in the soil where we can access it later on for crop productivity.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:22):**  And as much of a minefield as it must be getting into farming with all of the regulations and  
**[0:11:27-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:27):**  the things that you have to accommodate and understand and follow in this age of all the  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:35):**  litigation around it, I think it's a really important step, especially outlined in this  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:40):**  book that facilitates that kind of conversation so that people can start to make progress  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:45):**  and move towards ecological ways of production while still working with the system and helping  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:50):**  to guide it into something that aspires to a better way of managing the land.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:11:56):**  So designing to mitigate normal extreme weather events is something that you really stress  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:02):**  in this book because like you said, the extremities of these patterns is a given and people are  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:09):**  continuously looking at them as anomalies that are things that don't necessarily need  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:14):**  to be accounted for and are unfortunate events and something either just to buy insurance  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:18):**  for.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:19):**  But you really go to the source in saying that these events are the norm in nature and  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:25):**  they should be accommodated for at the beginning of the design.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:29):**  Can you tell me a little bit how you've managed to do that in some examples of your own work?  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:33):**  Well, because what's interesting about the whole question is in one sense it's a sense  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:41):**  of perspective in that guess what?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:45):**  We're going to get a huge rain event some point in time.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:48):**  If we don't plan for that, it's not a disaster.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:52):**  It's coming.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:53):**  It's going to happen.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:54):**  There will be a big rain event.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:56):**  So we design for it.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:12:58):**  Then we don't have these disasters.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:00):**  Let's just take an example, last summer or a year ago, 2018, there was a 19 and a half  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:08):**  inch rainfall in Cross Plains, Wisconsin that I happened to be driving down the road when  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:13):**  it hit.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:14):**  There was literally a flash flood.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:16):**  This wall of water came out of nowhere and washed several cars off the road, blew out  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:22):**  a bridge.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:24):**  People died, an amazing amount of destruction.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:27):**  One of the reasons why the flooding was so extreme is that all of the agricultural land  
**[0:13:34-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:34):**  surrounding Cross Plains, Wisconsin had no water management structures or strategy in  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:42):**  place.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:43):**  The only water management structures that were in place were tile drainage to help the  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:49):**  water drain off of the agricultural fields faster.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:13:54):**  So the current agricultural USDA best management practices of tile draining those fields, so  
**[0:14:01-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:01):**  corn could be planted way too early in the season, actually made the floods worse.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:09):**  If we just understand that we're going to get a big rainstorm, that more rain will fall  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:15):**  in a given period of time than the soil can absorb, we need to mitigate that.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:21):**  We need to spread it out, redistribute it.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:23):**  We need to store it in particular locations and allow it to now move through the landscape  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:29):**  more slowly.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:30):**  It will help to mitigate these and eliminate these flash floods that happen all over the  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:36):**  place.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:39):**  Because storms, hurricanes are not a natural disaster.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:44):**  Hurricanes are normal.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:45):**  They're real.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:46):**  The same thing, let's just switch and go to fire in California.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:51):**  California is a fire driven, a fire disturbed landscape and has been for zillions of years.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:14:59):**  It is pure design stupidity for human beings to build flammable buildings in a fire environment  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:09):**  because we know that the fire will come.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:13):**  It's a fire environment, always has been.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:16):**  And so it's not a disaster when the fire comes, but having buildings that explode in the heat  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:23):**  actually make the disaster.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:26):**  They make the fire worse.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:28):**  So why don't we just understand that floodplains flood?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:34):**  It's not a disaster.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:35):**  It's normal.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:36):**  And I think it's just a perspective issue.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:38):**  And if we look at it from the fact that these events, whether it's fire or huge rainstorms,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:45):**  hurricanes, these are normal events on planet Earth.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:50):**  We human beings need to understand how to live within the context of normal events on  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:56):**  planet Earth.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:57):**  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:15:59):**  That's really well said.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:00):**  And, you know, I've done interviews with people like Eric Olson, who've talked in detail about  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:04):**  the fire ecologies in California and how the disastrous element of them are the failings  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:10):**  of our design, our infrastructure to accommodate the natural rhythms of that ecosystem.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:15):**  And just like you were talking about with the floodplains and the hurricanes, those  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:19):**  were all here before us.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:21):**  But they're starting to get worse and become disasters because of the way that we've integrated  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:25):**  our lives without accommodating those things or designing in a way that can absorb or work  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:32):**  with the energies that naturally come through those areas.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:36):**  So let's talk about some of the primary elements that you use to make use of these resources  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:42):**  as they come onto the landscape.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:45):**  And one of the main ones is the swale.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:48):**  Now it goes by a lot of other names in your book.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:50):**  You refer to it as the swile, making fun a little bit of the Australian accent of the  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:55):**  guys who kind of pioneered this.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:57):**  I love that.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:16:59):**  So let's start at the beginning and talk about, A, what it's used for.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:03):**  And we can refer to it as in other terms because it can be used as a lot of different things,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:08):**  but also when it's not appropriate as a method for collecting rainwater.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:13):**  Right.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:14):**  Well, from the permaculture perspective, a swale is a water harvesting ditch.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:22):**  We make a channel and with the soil that you remove from this channel, you put it into  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:28):**  a pile down slope from that.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:33):**  What's really fascinating is a swale as described that way and the way the permaculture is to  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:38):**  use the term fits the definition, the USDA definition of a terrace.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:44):**  There's all kinds of different terrace shapes and forms.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:49):**  It's not like a rice paddy terrace that you see on the mountains of Bali or Machu Picchu,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:53):**  stuff like that.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:54):**  It's a swale.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:17:57):**  You'd make a channel and then with the material you remove from the channel, you make a ridge  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:01):**  or a mound or berm, whatever you want to call it.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:06):**  Then it's pitched at a gradient, slightly downhill on one end, water will move through  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:15):**  that water collecting channel.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:21):**  Used as a directional water delivery system, it's one of the simplest ways to make water  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:28):**  move in a landscape is by digging a little channel in the soil.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:35):**  As a water movement structure, that's applicable on any landscapes, all over the place, flat,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:43):**  steep, dry, et cetera.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:45):**  If you have a channel in the soil to move excess rain by excess rain, when you get a  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:50):**  rain event, even in Saudi Arabia for example, a lot of the landforms in Saudi Arabia are  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:57):**  caused by water erosion.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:58):**  It's like, what?  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:18:59):**  It's a desert.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:00):**  It's like, that's right.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:02):**  There's hardly any vegetation holding things together, so when the rain does come, it doesn't  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:07):**  infiltrate because the soil is too hot, it's too packed, it's already super dry.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:14):**  It runs off and it creates erosion.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:16):**  When this water comes, even if it's on perfectly quote, unquote flat land and there's no such  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:21):**  thing, you make a channel in the ground and you can move the water to a location where  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:26):**  you can store it.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:28):**  As it's moving along, it's also soaking in.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:32):**  The swale, a water collecting channel with a mound in combination, is usable as a water  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:43):**  delivery technique in all landscapes, any landscapes.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:47):**  A swale used as a water infiltration technique would be more applicable on the upland sites  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:19:56):**  up and once you start to get above floodplains, et cetera.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:00):**  What's interesting about this swale, now we're using it in the uplands as a water infiltration  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:05):**  system.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:06):**  Well, now down low in the lowlands, say river floodplains or in the example of the Netherlands  
**[0:20:13-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:13):**  and Louisiana, places, UK, these are all places where I've worked, below sea level, we can  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:21):**  use the same structure, an excavated channel with a mound.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:27):**  We're actually using that in order to create dry land up on the mound.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:32):**  So the same structure, a channel with a mound, can be used in various different parts of  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:38):**  the landscape and it has a different effect because of where it is.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:42):**  We can use it to soak water, we can use it to deliver water, we can use it to actually  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:48):**  create dry land to plant on, et cetera.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:53):**  From my perspective, I see that applicable in all landscapes.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:20:57):**  Now even in areas, especially in the far north, where you get frozen ground or snow in the  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:05):**  wintertime, when you have frozen ground, no matter how fertile your soil is, you will  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:12):**  not get water infiltration when it rains on frozen ground, for example.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:18):**  100% of it will run off.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:20):**  So we want to capture that, send it to a location where it can be stored, a pond, a tank, et  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:26):**  cetera.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:27):**  If nothing else, we want to slow it down.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:30):**  So instead of it roaring down the hill and creating flash floods with all these properties  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:34):**  in the uplands, sending water down to the village or town, now we flood out the town,  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:38):**  we prevent the floods by just slowing it down and retaining it in the uplands for a while.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:45):**  So snow melt, rapid snow melt and rain on frozen ground is another great reason to have  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:51):**  swales in the landscape.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:21:53):**  There's a lot of people that just get some kind of visceral reaction against the idea  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:00):**  of putting a swale on a property.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:02):**  And for whatever their objections are, most of what I've observed is when people have  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:08):**  an objection to having a channel with a mound, most of the objections that I see is that  
**[0:22:15-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:15):**  those people don't understand how to use that as a design element to make your farming operation  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:23):**  more efficient.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:25):**  One of the biggest complaints is that they're in the way.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:28):**  Well, once you put these channels in the ground, they are the way.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:32):**  So it's in our best interest to have a sound, prudent, well thought out, efficient design  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:40):**  so then they aren't in the way.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:42):**  Or you just design crossings to go over them.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:45):**  Other people complain that, oh well, it takes land out of production.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:48):**  Well, if you take a smooth slope and then you add a triangular channel, and I wish I  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:22:57):**  could draw you a picture of this, and then make a nice smooth triangular mound, you actually  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:02):**  can design it around the farming equipment based on the equipment and you actually increase  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:07):**  the surface area on which you can farm.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:10):**  So if you take a five acre farm, you could possibly gain as much as an extra acre of  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:15):**  surface area because you've added these convolutions to it and you've done it in such a way that  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:21):**  it's efficient for your equipment and it actually accomplishes whatever your design objectives  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:26):**  are with this water, whether it's in drier climates, you may want to focus it on a storage  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:32):**  pond for later irrigation.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:34):**  In wetter climates, you may want to move it away from your wetter spots to irrigate drier  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:39):**  ridge.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:40):**  So I see them as a useful tool when appropriately designed and applied on all landscapes everywhere,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:51):**  any farm.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:53):**  And if you don't want swales, don't put them in.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:57):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:23:58):**  Yeah, it's not mandatory by any means.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:02):**  And the basis of the methodology that you're teaching from here is also much of the inspiration  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:08):**  of the title of the book, which is P.A. Yeoman's original Water for Every Farm.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:14):**  And you've since kind of applied a lot of those things, but also come up with your own  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:19):**  methodology based on your experience and how you've seen this work in the field.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:23):**  Could you talk a little bit about how you sort of backed into the Master Line system,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:29):**  which is outlined well in the book, and found the Master Line of New Forest Farm that connected  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:34):**  most of the primary valleys for your site?  
**[0:24:38-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:38):**  Well the Water for Every Farm by P.A. Yeomans, the whole Keyline design methodology really  
**[0:24:48-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:48):**  pivots around a really simple way to look at the landscape and observe how water moves  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:57):**  on the landscape.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:24:58):**  You know, a primary valley is like the first land form where water actually becomes channelized  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:05):**  naturally in an overflow event, and the water starts to move.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:09):**  And you go up to the head of these water moving channels called primary valleys, and that  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:15):**  is a key point in the landscape.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:17):**  Well, in Water for Every Farm, the key point is used as a design element.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:23):**  You make a reference line at that key point, which is a contour line from that key point,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:30):**  perfectly horizontal.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:32):**  Then when you're in primary valleys, below that contour line, that key line, you use  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:39):**  your equipment, you build your fences, you till or whatever it is that you do, you rotate  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:45):**  your cattle parallel to that and down in the primary valley forms.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:50):**  Well coupled with that is you start on a ridge of the lowest practical ridge contour, and  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:25:57):**  you make a contour line, that's your ridge reference line.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:00):**  And then on the ridge forms, you now use the landscape parallel to that ridge reference  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:06):**  line and upward.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:09):**  Well it's all well and good, and Yeoman says that it works on every landscape everywhere.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:15):**  And maybe when the book was written and how they applied it in Australia, maybe that is  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:22):**  true.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:23):**  But Australia happens to be the hydrologically simplest landform on the planet.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:29):**  It has no river systems that are more complex than a third order stream.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:37):**  Two primary valleys come together to make a secondary, and actually the rest of the  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:42):**  world calls that a first order stream.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:44):**  So two first order streams come together to make a second order stream.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:49):**  If more first order streams are added to it, it's still a second order stream.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:53):**  When two second order streams come together, they make a third order stream, and that is  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:26:58):**  as complex as Australia is anywhere.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:02):**  So it's a very simplified landscape compared to most of the rest of the world.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:09):**  The Mississippi River watershed, where I had to try to apply this keyline design principles,  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:16):**  it's the most complex river system on the face of the planet.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:20):**  I think it's a tenth order stream, or maybe an eleventh.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:22):**  I don't remember right now offhand.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:25):**  And so in order to design a water management system on the most complex landform on the  
**[0:27:32-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:32):**  planet using the simplified keyline cultivation pattern did not work, does not work.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:40):**  Most of the people that I encounter who call me and my design team in to help them with  
**[0:27:46-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:46):**  their water management on their property have tried to do Yeoman's simple techniques, and  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:54):**  it hasn't worked, and they scratch their heads and wonder why.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:27:57):**  Another very strong part of the whole keyline design methodology is creating channels that  
**[0:28:06-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:06):**  connect ponds that are at your key points in the landscape, connect them with a water  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:16):**  conveyance channel, they call them diversion drains.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:19):**  You would make these water channels to move water from one pond to the next to the next  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:23):**  to the next.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:26):**  But what ends up having to happen is that will mess with the patterning on the land.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:32):**  So these two things within keyline design, these cascading series of ponds and the keyline  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:38):**  cultivation pattern, if you put the two of them together, they don't really work well.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:42):**  So most people have been confused by the keyline methodology, one, because that simple way  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:51):**  of describing landforms does not apply to a complex landform.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:28:56):**  And then to start moving water from one pond to the next, this word is used over and over  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:01):**  again in all of the keyline books that I've read anywhere, adjust accordingly.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:07):**  Well, they don't tell you how to adjust, because when you adjust, you can all of a sudden,  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:12):**  when you're taking your ridge reference lines and your key lines and you're making your  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:16):**  parallels up on the ridges and parallels down in the valleys on a complex landform, those  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:22):**  may not pitch in the direction that you want the water to go.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:27):**  And so when you adjust, you either create a high spot in the middle of your tillage  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:32):**  pattern or your water channels or a low spot.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:34):**  So there's all these complexities that are not addressed in Water for Every Farm by P.A.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:43):**  Yeomans.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:44):**  Well, the techniques that I outline in Water for Any Farm, because it is for any farm,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:50):**  is that what are your goals with water when it rains on your property faster than your  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:55):**  soil can soak it in?  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:57):**  What do you want to do with that water?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:29:59):**  Do you want to move it somewhere and store it?  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:01):**  Do you want to slow it down?  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:02):**  Do you want to soak it in?  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:04):**  There are a number of different things that you, based on your design goals, want to do.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:10):**  And then how do we adjust our agricultural use of the land so as to be more efficient  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:19):**  while simultaneously accomplishing our water management objectives?  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:24):**  I don't know if that made any sense or if we just had question creep and I went off  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:28):**  into left field somewhere.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:29):**  No, no, it made really good sense to me, but I also have the chance to go through your  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:33):**  book so I know exactly what you're talking about.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:35):**  So what happened on New Forest Farm is I literally took, this was before the age of the internet  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:40):**  and it was before the age of cell phones, you dial a phone call out of your town and  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:45):**  it cost you like three bucks.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:46):**  So I made phone calls to Australia to find an out of print, small publishing book intended  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:54):**  for farmers in Australia and I finally found it.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:30:57):**  So now I've got this book in my hands and I'm following directions right out of the  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:01):**  book and Yeoman says if you go find a key point and you put in a key line, the key line  
**[0:31:07-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:07):**  is in the valley form only until the valley turns outward and one of my primary valleys  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:15):**  on the farm, you start at the key point, the left side of it turns outward so you stop  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:21):**  just as it starts to turn outward on the valley.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:24):**  Well, on the right hand side, the valley didn't curve outward.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:28):**  It kept curving inward and inward and inward and there were no water movement channels  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:32):**  in that curve and so right there, if I was trying to follow the key line protocol to  
**[0:31:40-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:40):**  a letter, my land did not behave the way Yeoman's said it always does and that was the first  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:49):**  problem I encountered.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:50):**  So what I ended up doing then was to start at the key points.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:31:54):**  Now this is actually, the key line design methodology is brilliant and Yeoman's was  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:00):**  the person who actually coined the term key point and if you use your fingers as an example,  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:06):**  if you make a fist where the line is between your fingers, that's a primary valley in your  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:11):**  handscape.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:12):**  Well, where the primary valley now becomes the fleshy web between your fingers, that's  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:18):**  the key point in the landscape.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:19):**  No one else had bothered to pay attention to that before and so that was a brilliant  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:25):**  discovery by P.A. Yeoman's.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:27):**  Well then, in a landscape, what's interesting is all the different key points are at different  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:34):**  elevations higher and lower than one another and if you look at those key points on your  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:38):**  hands, they're not way down by your knuckles or your fingertips.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:41):**  They're way up high in the landscape or the top of that ridge.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:45):**  So by identifying the key points on your property, then designing your water management system  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:51):**  based on those key points, you've all of a sudden started to manage the water high up  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:32:56):**  on the landscape and the landform and now you have the ability to soak it in and move  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:01):**  it through channels all the way through your property slowly and carefully giving it extra  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:07):**  residence time so it can soak into the ground.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:10):**  So that's how I backed into what we're calling the Master Line system because on every landform,  
**[0:33:17-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:17):**  on every property that you've got, somewhere on that property is a single line that will  
**[0:33:24-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:24):**  optimize your ability to influence the distribution and the soaking, the infiltration of the rainfall  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:36):**  that falls on your site.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:37):**  There really is, even Yeoman's even says it, that one of the principle considerations is  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:41):**  to make a series of cascading ponds that the diversion drain from one pond fills the next  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:48):**  one which diverts and fills the next one and fills the next one.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:51):**  That is a description of the Master Line system, that's where we start.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:33:56):**  Well then how we on the Master Line system diverge from that is instead of following  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:03):**  a protocol of find the primary valleys and go parallel down from the key line and parallel  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:09):**  up from the ridge reference line, we go ahead and ask, well what do you want to do with  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:13):**  the water?  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:14):**  What crops are you going to be growing or pasture animals are you going to graze?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:18):**  What's the equipment that you're using and now we will design a farm design based around  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:25):**  that Master Line that moves the water where we want to do it at first.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:29):**  Then if we choose, we can put additional channels, terraces in USDA terminology, swales and berms  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:37):**  in permaculture in my most commonly used language.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:41):**  We put additional swales and berms down slope from the upper, that Master Line that those  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:50):**  additional swales accomplish our water movement and infiltration objectives.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:34:56):**  That's where we differ from the Key Line cultivation pattern is you can do whatever you want moving  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:02):**  that water around on your property as long as one, it's legal to do so and two, you use  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:07):**  structures that are approved by your USDA, your state, local government, federal government,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:13):**  etc.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:14):**  In doing Master Line system as described in water for any farm, it will comply with all  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:19):**  of those levels of regulation except in the places where they don't allow you to have  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:23):**  a puddle standing around for longer than 15 seconds.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:27):**  Those are examples of extremes anyway.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:30):**  With that description and I know that you were talking about this just a little earlier  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:34):**  about how the Master Line can serve as the pattern for the whole farm and solve that  
**[0:35:38-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:38):**  problem of the V-shaped fields that were endemic to the Key Line system on its own.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:45):**  With the Master Line system, you can create these parallel contour lines that are a real  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:49):**  advantage for people who are working with larger machinery and the efficiencies of larger  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:53):**  scale farms.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:54):**  Could you talk about how that works?  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:35:58):**  One of the things I have to correct your language a little bit and that we'll be making parallels,  
**[0:36:05-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:05):**  yes, but they may not be contours.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:08):**  They might not be contours.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:11):**  If we go ahead and design a water management structure, USDA, it's called a terrace, permaculture,  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:19):**  it's a swale or a diversion drain in Key Line language.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:23):**  If we put a diversion drain that we locate at that sweet spot in our landscape that connects  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:29):**  all these different primary valleys, we can design a system now that's perfectly parallel  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:36):**  across that landscape as we go down slope.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:42):**  What ends up happening is the terrace that we make, the subsequent terrace down, we strive  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:47):**  to make alley width, which is the farmable interval between terrace structures, multiple  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:53):**  intervals of two times your equipment.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:36:55):**  It's a very even number of passes as you're going across the landform.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:00):**  Let's say we're going to take four equipment widths down slope.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:05):**  First of all, we run a couple of quickie little equations that you can get from your local  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:11):**  USDA office.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:12):**  One is the VI equation, then the other one is the HI equation, which basically for your  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:17):**  soil type region and rainfall patterns gives you a safe maximum allowable alley width before  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:23):**  erosion can be too problematic.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:26):**  You find what's the harmonized version of an alley that's not so wide that you'll increase  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:36):**  erosion and yet still be multiples of two times your equipment width.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:40):**  Then we'll put in another swale, another terrace.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:43):**  That step will be parallel on the ground, but it may not be on contour and it may pitch  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:51):**  the water in the opposite direction where you want to go.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:37:56):**  We'll go ahead and we'll install that parallel swale.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:00):**  Then if we want to move the water in a certain direction, we now adjust the bottom of the  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:06):**  channel, the USDA terrace channel.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:09):**  We adjust the bottom of the swale on one end.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:13):**  That will allow the water to move towards that direction.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:16):**  We may end up with a parallel swale berm that the whole thing looks like it pitches to the  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:24):**  left, but the bottom of the swale, the terrace channel, actually pitches to the right.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:28):**  We can actually create a system that's both parallel and gradient.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:34):**  It's parallel to the master line and it pitches in the direction that we want to go.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:40):**  We can continue those parallels down the field.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:42):**  What does happen though is we are imposing a regular form, a regular pattern onto an  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:49):**  irregular landscape.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:52):**  What will happen, and a great example is to look at your hands, your fingers again.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:38:56):**  Notice the half moons under your fingernails and notice the creases on your knuckles.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:02):**  What will happen in a parallel master line system is the fact you will have odd spots  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:08):**  out at the ridges.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:09):**  What's convenient about those little odd spots out on the ridges is we can have a terrace  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:14):**  channel, a swale, that goes right to that little odd spot there.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:18):**  We can use that odd spot as an infiltration zone where the water from the swale, from  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:24):**  the terrace channel, discharges in a sheet across the ridge form.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:30):**  Ridges are actually the driest shape on a property.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:35):**  We can use these terraces, the swales, to deliver the water to a ridge and then we can  
**[0:39:42-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:42):**  discharge water on that odd shape out on the tips of your fingers, on the ends of ridges.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:50):**  We can also use that spot as a place to plant some specialty crops.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:39:56):**  You can use it for planting butterfly habitat, wild pollinator habitat, etc., etc., or some  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:04):**  sort of crop that has a higher value than if you're growing corn in these alleys, for  
**[0:40:10-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:10):**  example.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:11):**  A higher value crop can be grown in these little odd spots out in the corners.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:15):**  The actual ag fields are made to be a lot more efficient because they're designed around  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:22):**  your equipment and you make even number of passes across the fields.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:25):**  No point fields is what those funny odd shapes are called.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:29):**  No point fields in the cropping area unless you want them to be cropped.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:37):**  When the system is used, the parallel master line system is used, those odd spots and point  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:42):**  fields will be out on the ridges primarily.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:48):**  You got to look at some diagrams to see how that rolls because we're trying to do this  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:52):**  with words and it's tricky to describe land shapes and parallel and all that just using  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:58):**  words.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:40:59):**  Yeah, it's always difficult to describe things like this, but you do a really good job of  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:03):**  giving some examples, especially towards the end of the book in those drawings about how  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:09):**  with the exact same landform someone could effectively put in a whole different range  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:15):**  of contours and terraces and planning like this that basically serve more or less the  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:22):**  same intent but can be different based on their own intentions and their goals for the  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:26):**  place without having to deviate from this system and that was one of the parts that  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:31):**  I found most useful because like you said, this can be difficult to explain in words  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:35):**  and it's a lot of concepts until you see that drawn on the paper.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:40):**  But what is great about this system is just how flexible it is to anybody's goals for  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:45):**  their property.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:47):**  I consider that to be somewhat of a compliment, so thank you about that.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:50):**  I just saw this book for the first time in printed form two days ago and that was exactly  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:41:55):**  what caught my eyes, like oh my gosh, that alone if you just look at all those different  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:00):**  examples is mind blowing.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:02):**  Well here's what's interesting, this is I already explained earlier about the difference  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:07):**  in complexity of landforms.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:09):**  If you take the keyline cultivation pattern, it starts with a contour line from a key point.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:13):**  So that is one, let's introduce one into the equation.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:20):**  Now if we have a ridge on either side, let's use our throat where your collarbone comes  
**[0:42:24-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:24):**  together right at your Adam's apple as a key point and if we make a horseshoe shape at  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:31):**  that at our throat, that's a key line.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:35):**  Then if we go out to our shoulder and make a horseshoe around our shoulder, that's a  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:38):**  ridge reference line and then go make a horseshoe on the other shoulder.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:42):**  There's three design elements in there.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:44):**  If you go parallel up from the shoulder and then parallel down from your throat, that's  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:49):**  the key line cultivation pattern.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:52):**  That's it.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:53):**  That's all that it ever is.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:42:54):**  However, with that same landform, we can actually by only using a swale that is A, perfectly  
**[0:43:01-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:01):**  on contour or B, pitched up ever so slightly 1% or less, which is 1 foot over 100 foot  
**[0:43:10-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:10):**  length or pitched down at 1% or less, only using those three different variables, two  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:19):**  shoulder references, two ridge references and a key line reference by using those three  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:25):**  lines as our reference lines and using up a little bit, down a little bit or perfectly  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:31):**  on contour on the Masterline system.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:34):**  Just using those instructions, we have 739 different possibilities that we can come up  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:39):**  with and that's if we just use a single pitch along any swale or terrace because your swale  
**[0:43:45-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:45):**  can go down at half a percent, it can then change and go perfectly on contour, it can  
**[0:43:52-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:52):**  go down at 2%, it can come slow down to 1%, you can adjust them all along the way.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:43:59):**  The number of different arrangements on a single landform is almost infinite.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:05):**  I haven't done the math on all this.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:07):**  It's almost infinite.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:08):**  No matter where you are, any farm, you can use these techniques as outlined in my book,  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:14):**  the Masterline system, it'll work to accomplish your objectives.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:19):**  Yeah, I mean that's really what I was blown away by because I had always previously thought  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:22):**  of Earthworks as being somewhat of a limited amount of options depending on the land that  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:27):**  you've got and this really opened up the doors for where you place certain elements and how  
**[0:44:33-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:33):**  you can incorporate the same system for kind of small scale farms with a lot of diversity  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:41):**  or to what's more common in the United States where people are growing just a limited amount  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:46):**  of things and the convention has you working with large machinery and it really makes it  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:51):**  applicable for that context too.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:54):**  So now we often think of Earthworks as being a very permanent thing.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:44:58):**  You put them in once and you more or less just go about the other aspects of design  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:04):**  but I've seen in a couple of my own experiences on clients lands that they do need a little  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:09):**  bit of maintenance.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:11):**  Can you talk about some of the maintenance of Earthwork elements that you've come across  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:15):**  yourself, things like preventing sediment or backfill in swales or terraces or sealing  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:21):**  and resealing ponds, correcting the grade or dredging ponds and things like that.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:26):**  What are some of the things that you can do to prevent excessive maintenance and what  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:29):**  are the things you should kind of know that you need to look out for over a certain amount  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:33):**  of time?  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:34):**  Well first and foremost is if you're in a humid environment at all that will support  
**[0:45:40-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:40):**  the growth of grass is to make sure that the Earthworks that you do are entirely grassed  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:47):**  in well with a good dense sod.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:50):**  There are places where you won't be able to get a dense sod established and I understand  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:55):**  that you're not going to be able to do it and the more arid and hot environments you  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:45:59):**  won't be able to get that dense sod.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:01):**  So having a dense sod on it will help with any potential blowouts in the future.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:08):**  One of the things that also helps a lot to prevent blowouts is the fact that when we  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:13):**  design a system our terraces, and it's not described in the USDA language how we design  
**[0:46:18-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:18):**  terraces, the water conveyance portion of your swale if we make that entirely below  
**[0:46:25-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:25):**  ground level and if we make it far enough below ground level that even in the most catastrophic  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:31):**  storm it's the Earth itself that's holding the water back you won't have a berm blow  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:37):**  out because the water is down below ground level and then it moves somewhere else in  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:42):**  the landscape a little further down.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:45):**  So that's just another unique feature of how we're doing, mostly doing our swales and berms.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:51):**  Well then to prevent inflow if you're going to crop, if you're going to do row crops where  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:46:56):**  tillage is used, and on New Forest Farm most people can go somewhere online and just search  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:02):**  for that image and you'll see the aerial photograph.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:05):**  Like in the center of the photograph there's a triangle piece of land that's at the very  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:13):**  top of the hill, there's a wind turbine tower up there now generating our electricity.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:18):**  But the first four parallel planting fields that you see were used as vegetable production  
**[0:47:28-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:28):**  for 15 plus years and what happens as you have that exposed soil is you will get sediment,  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:35):**  especially the finest sediment that will start to fill your swale channel.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:40):**  And what ended up happening on those fields as I used them over time, that soil creep  
**[0:47:46-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:46):**  eventually filled the entire swale and now is at the top of where the berm was so the  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:52):**  whole entire field over 20 years worth of use has shifted so the whole entire field  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:47:58):**  is now a terrace form.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:00):**  Well what you can do is you can either maintain your swale channels, terrace channels, or  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:06):**  you can choose not to like on those fields I chose not to and allow them to fill because  
**[0:48:11-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:11):**  you're still getting the water movement and a lot better infiltration because you're hopefully  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:17):**  using good cover crops, encouraging good biological activity and you're helping to deepen the  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:24):**  topsoil layer by your land use practices and so you'll get better water infiltration on  
**[0:48:30-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:30):**  that anyways.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:33):**  Or you can go ahead and maintain your terrace channels, your swale channels and clean them  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:37):**  out every once in a while.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:38):**  I've worked on places where swales, terraces were put in back in the 1930s and they're  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:46):**  still functioning perfectly well even when farmers have been tilling for the what 70,  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:51):**  80 years since then.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:54):**  So these are structures that last a long time.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:48:57):**  However one of the things that people don't understand is when you're doing it the way  
**[0:49:02-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:02):**  we do it and I describe it in the book Water for Any Farm is the direction of water flow  
**[0:49:08-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:08):**  in that terrace channel, the swale channel is adjustable and by simply lowering the bottom  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:16):**  of the channel on one side you can make the water all move to the right for example.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:22):**  Let's say you do that for five, six, seven, eight years and say you know what I actually  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:25):**  want the water to go over to the left.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:27):**  You don't have to tear down the whole structure and start over.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:30):**  You just adjust the bottom of the channel and you remove material from the high side  
**[0:49:35-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:35):**  and you put it over on the low side.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:36):**  You can use a ditch which you can use a one bottom plow, two bottom plow to make a new  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:41):**  channel in the bottom of the channel and you make it send the water in the opposite direction.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:45):**  So you can adjust these things year after year if you want.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:50):**  Yeah that's another way that this book presents a lot of options that I hadn't considered  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:54):**  before in the ways that you can use different types of machinery more than just like a keyline  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:49:59):**  plow or a backhoe or you know some of the conventional ways we think of doing earthworks  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:04):**  but other farm machinery that can be leveraged to do this without having to buy more equipment.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:10):**  So one of the things that I really wanted to explore with you is that up until now we've  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:14):**  been talking so much about contours on the land but there's quite a few people who have  
**[0:50:19-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:19):**  really really flat terrain and I'm wondering do earthworks and other water harvesting strategies  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:26):**  apply for flat land or what would you recommend as a way to make the most of your water resources  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:32):**  if your land completely lacks contour?  
**[0:50:35-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:35):**  First of all there is no such thing period there is no such thing as perfectly flat land  
**[0:50:43-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:43):**  even if it's been laser leveled to build a shopping mall it's not perfectly flat there  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:50):**  is a pitch and a slope and a grade to it.  
**[0:50:52-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:50:52):**  So then the question becomes for the farmer using that am I getting adequate soil hydration  
**[0:51:01-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:01):**  by not having any kind of earthworks on this property and if you are great and if you don't  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:07):**  expect to have a drought never have gotten a drought never will get a drought great well  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:12):**  if however you do have dry periods it's in your best interest to capture the rain when  
**[0:51:17-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:17):**  it is here move it where you want to move it slow it down let it soak in and so therefore  
**[0:51:24-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:24):**  using some sort of channel a swale a terrace maybe you want to design it just as an excavated  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:31):**  channel like a v-shape or a trapezoid shaped channel or a curve shaped channel with no  
**[0:51:36-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:36):**  berm at all the water will still any water when a rain event happens a certain amount  
**[0:51:42-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:42):**  will soak in in it'll soak in that's your that's your infiltration rate well any rain  
**[0:51:48-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:48):**  in excess of your infiltration rate is going to be on the surface and it's going to move  
**[0:51:54-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:54):**  even on land that you may think is perfectly flat because it's not perfectly flat so then  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:51:59):**  as it starts to move let's capture it in a channel and direct it to where we want it  
**[0:52:04-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:04):**  to go before we infiltrate it or discharge it so even on flat land a excavated channel  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:13):**  is a useful tool to move water someplace or to soak water in someplace and if you don't  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:19):**  want them you don't want them and if you think that that a swale a terrace is going to be  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:25):**  in the way well design it so it's not in the way or use your your land in such a way that  
**[0:52:30-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:30):**  you harmonize with the water flow that you've now set up if they're useful practice anywhere  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:40):**  when you do it do it right do it well and and design things to accommodate your farming  
**[0:52:45-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:45):**  practices and if you're doing stupid farming practices change your practices that's probably  
**[0:52:50-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:50):**  one of the biggest issues that I've seen with people who have swales terrace systems if  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:52:55):**  they have complaints about it it's usually because they're not using it as it was designed  
**[0:53:00-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:00):**  a hammer is not a drill if you try to use a hammer to make holes in a piece of wood  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:06):**  you can do it but it's going to be a mess and it's going to take you a long time use  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:11):**  the system as it's designed and it will be more efficient than than the way you're probably  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:16):**  using it right now because you're now optimizing your water and optimizing your equipment use  
**[0:53:21-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:21):**  harmonizing the two yeah that's really well said and you know we've talked about all of  
**[0:53:26-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:26):**  these ways of capturing the water through alterations of the terrain but you're always  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:31):**  going to reach a limit if you're not trying to also improve the amount of water that your  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:36):**  terrain can infiltrate on its own for the quality of the soil so let's talk a little  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:41):**  bit about building soil as a harvesting strategy and how creating the conditions for life  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:46):**  can speed up this process from one that takes geological time as it would naturally do on  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:51):**  its own to one that can be achieved in a few decades with the right interventions what  
**[0:53:56-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:53:56):**  we're not doing is we're not creating topsoil per se from the top up we're not applying  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:02):**  extra compost or you know extra fill that we brought in from somewhere else what we're  
**[0:54:07-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:07):**  doing is we are converting the existing subsoil converting that into topsoil and now and that's  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:14):**  almost a quote right out of P.A. Yeoman's Water for Every Farm and that is one of the  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:20):**  overall design objectives first of all by increasing our topsoil depth that means we're  
**[0:54:26-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:26):**  increasing the organic matter content in most cases not if you're in peat or muck which  
**[0:54:32-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:32):**  is already high organic matter in most agricultural soils if we increase the the depth of the  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:40):**  topsoil we're increasing the organic matter content which is carbon that came directly  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:45):**  out of the atmosphere and put into the soil and I forget what the number was but it's  
**[0:54:49-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:49):**  less than like a couple of percent if we raise on all the agricultural land worldwide if  
**[0:54:56-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:54:56):**  we raise soil organic matters just a couple of percent we eliminate the any kind of excess  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:02):**  carbon and we take we take atmospheric carbon levels back down to pre-industrial levels  
**[0:55:07-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:07):**  how we do that is we increase the biological activity life needs air it needs water and  
**[0:55:15-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:15):**  some sort of food and so if we go ahead and we design the system to manage our water infiltrate  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:23):**  it where we want to infiltrate it then use a perennial cover say pasture mix whatever  
**[0:55:28-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:28):**  your local pasture mix du jour is one of the tools that's very useful P.A. Yeoman's talks  
**[0:55:35-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:35):**  about a Yeoman's plow or a chisel plow don't use an American style chisel plow when doing  
**[0:55:41-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:41):**  this use a subsoiler or a mole plow a deep shank ripper or or my neighbor Paul Coonert  
**[0:55:50-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:50):**  calls it the hook so use a hook just to drag through the soil it cuts a slot in the soil  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:55:56):**  and it shatters a little bit on either side makes cracks and fissures so that when the  
**[0:56:01-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:01):**  next rain comes water will easily penetrate that slot and then it'll start to seep sideways  
**[0:56:07-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:07):**  it'll whip sideways through the the fractures that are made by this tool it doesn't it doesn't  
**[0:56:13-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:13):**  plow the ground up make it turn black just make these little lines these little slots  
**[0:56:17-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:17):**  in your in your fields if you're using this tool the the subsoiler parallel to your your  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:23):**  soil system whatever direction you've pitched the water wherever you've sent it to it enhances  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:29):**  that and all the water that falls in the slots goes in that direction so now what we've got  
**[0:56:34-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:34):**  is we've got our major water management structures the swales and the berms that are capturing  
**[0:56:40-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:40):**  any kind of overflow that came off of the crop fields then in the crop fields we're  
**[0:56:44-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:44):**  using the subsoiler to make sure that more water infiltrates well with when that water  
**[0:56:49-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:49):**  infiltrates you know of moist soil all the way down as that water soaks in and continues  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:56:55):**  to you know go down into the into the water table as it's sinking it's pulling air into  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:00):**  the slot behind it you've got water and air the soil life will wake up and the soil life  
**[0:57:07-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:07):**  is now feeding off of the sugars exuded from the roots of plants any sloughing of roots  
**[0:57:13-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:13):**  from plants as you clip clip roots or graze graze the tops the grasses or mow them now  
**[0:57:20-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:20):**  you have water air and food for the soil life and you're creating topsoil that plus little  
**[0:57:25-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:25):**  slots create a loosened a little bit of a loosened zone and plant roots really proliferate  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:32):**  in there and when you first start doing this in the in the early years as you use the subsoiler  
**[0:57:37-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:37):**  in your in your system you'll notice a green line where you drag that top the subsoiler  
**[0:57:45-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:45):**  it almost looks like a nitrogen response you get this band of green these green strips  
**[0:57:50-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:50):**  going through your field as the soil continues to improve over time that'll that'll lessen  
**[0:57:56-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:57:56):**  to a certain degree you won't see that that response so much but you're still getting  
**[0:58:00-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:00):**  that the air in that water deep into the soil right where you need it now there's some folks  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:06):**  that have been telling me that oh you you in the arid regions this is where I've encountered  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:11):**  more people saying this you don't want to make your slots deep because then the water  
**[0:58:15-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:15):**  will go down below root level fast and then you won't be able to utilize it because your  
**[0:58:21-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:21):**  plant roots are so shallow it's like well when you use a subsoiler it cuts a slot yes  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:26):**  well then the slot kind of collapses a little bit behind itself it's still a very loosened  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:31):**  zone and when rain comes it does fill up that slot but it's got the any kind of rainfall  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:36):**  even if it's a shallow amount of rainfall it has to go down and it wets the sides of  
**[0:58:40-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:40):**  that slot on the way down and so it gets to your plant roots and so I I'm not really convinced  
**[0:58:48-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:48):**  that you have to make the slots shallow at first and then deeper later on as your roots  
**[0:58:53-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:58:53):**  develop more in my situation the clay soil is so hard when I first started farming there  
**[0:59:00-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:00):**  that my subsoiler would only go down eight inches because he just wouldn't go any further  
**[0:59:04-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:04):**  because it was so it's such a hard heavy thick clay but as as the years went by and the roots  
**[0:59:10-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:10):**  continued to penetrate the soil life you know it came to life I could put the the hook the  
**[0:59:16-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:16):**  subsoil goes deeper and deeper and deeper until now I can actually pull a two shank  
**[0:59:22-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:22):**  yeoman's plow which theoretically you need a 50 horsepower I never used to be able to  
**[0:59:26-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:26):**  pull even a one shank subsoiler American subsoiler with my tractor more than eight inches deep  
**[0:59:33-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:33):**  well now I can pull a two shank yeoman's plow subsoiler two and a half feet deep and I pull  
**[0:59:39-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:39):**  it with a 40 horse tractor that's how much the soil has softened up and loosened up and  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:44):**  so if you've got an increased topsoil depth you're going to get increased crop yields  
**[0:59:49-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:49):**  you have have increased water storage capacity because of all the organic matter that's the  
**[0:59:55-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=0:59:55):**  soil's ability to soak up all this rain and not be wet is is you have more ability in  
**[1:00:02-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:02):**  that soil to store water and not be wet as that's happened through times your crop yields  
**[1:00:07-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:07):**  go up your drought stress goes down because you're storing more water in the soil because  
**[1:00:13-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:13):**  your plants are able to access it all throughout the growing season even if it's just a short  
**[1:00:17-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:17):**  dry period you know your plants really won't suffer at all because the soil the water is  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:23):**  held right down there in the soil where they can get it so the subsoiler mole plow deep  
**[1:00:29-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:29):**  tine ripper whatever you want to call that yeoman's plow use whichever works in your  
**[1:00:35-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:35):**  your context nice now you mentioned earlier when we were speaking about these increasingly  
**[1:00:43-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:43):**  intense events where no amount of planning or or soil amendments are going to be able  
**[1:00:49-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:49):**  to accommodate the amount of water that you have to deal with and I know that you talked  
**[1:00:54-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:54):**  about some stories in the book even in just the last couple of years where you received  
**[1:00:58-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:00:58):**  water events that you had to deal with in a way that you hadn't up until now and many  
**[1:01:02-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:02):**  of us consider yours as being the farm as an example of a fairly mature system well  
**[1:01:07-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:07):**  designed to make the best use of water that it can though I'm sure you're always making  
**[1:01:12-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:12):**  improvements down the line and you still had to react to to an emergency and get the water  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:19):**  off of the different elements on your farm faster could you talk about first of all when  
**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:25):**  you decided to make that call when you had to really open up the drainage and what you  
**[1:01:30-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:30):**  did and how your sort of your system was able to accommodate that with the amendments as  
**[1:01:35-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:35):**  it came up right so you know in Wisconsin Southwest Wisconsin we've had last year 2018  
**[1:01:43-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:43):**  was record amounts of rain more than two times the you know historic average rain and then  
**[1:01:49-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:49):**  this year we're only two times the normal historic average rain so when you build a  
**[1:01:55-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:01:55):**  water retention landscape you will retain water well in the uppermost fields where I've  
**[1:02:02-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:02):**  been growing annual crops I've been selling wholesale organic produce for 25 years it  
**[1:02:10-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:10):**  was too wet to actually get into the fields at at a reasonable time in order for me to  
**[1:02:14-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:14):**  get a crop and so I'm gonna have to ask everybody to imagine a rectangle and you're looking  
**[1:02:21-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:21):**  at it as if you're looking at a bathroom mirror that's a rectangle shape if the top of the  
**[1:02:25-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:25):**  edge of the mirror and the lower edge of the mirror are swales terraces whatever and if  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:30):**  they move the water you know one way or the other left or the right it's up to you your  
**[1:02:35-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:35):**  design when you normally subsoil and use the field you'll go parallel to that and it helps  
**[1:02:42-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:42):**  with that water distribution pattern well once your soil is fully charged it's now it  
**[1:02:48-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:48):**  is now fully hydrated water starts to soak down into the subsoil well when you continue  
**[1:02:54-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:02:54):**  to get more water than then can soak in you fill all your ponds and that field is still  
**[1:03:00-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:00):**  too wet instead of of plowing or subsoiling parallel to those swale lines if you start  
**[1:03:09-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:09):**  at the upper right hand corner and you go diagonally down to the lower left corner that  
**[1:03:15-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:15):**  actually will be slightly downhill to the left and so now you can cultivate your fields  
**[1:03:20-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:20):**  diagonally across that way and it'll spread the water out to the furthest edge of the  
**[1:03:27-1:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:27):**  field so then you put it out onto like your farm access lanes or if there's other ponds  
**[1:03:33-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:33):**  or storage structures there and you don't have to make it a straight diagonal line your  
**[1:03:36-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:36):**  mine ended up being curves so what I ended up doing is with using the two bottom plow  
**[1:03:42-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:42):**  is I took a laser level out and I tried to find the longest possible gentle gradient  
**[1:03:49-1:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:49):**  line across that field and I put a drainage ditch through the middle of my field going  
**[1:03:55-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:55):**  to the left on that rectangle that we're looking at well then what happened is at the lower  
**[1:03:59-1:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:03:59):**  right hand corner of this mirror that we're looking at I breached that berm and allow  
**[1:04:06-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:06):**  the water to go back to what it used to do and flow down the primary valleys to flow  
**[1:04:12-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:12):**  away and in my upper fields where I was doing annual crops that allowed those fields to  
**[1:04:19-1:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:19):**  dry out somewhat but I never let the water exit the farm because further down below it's  
**[1:04:25-1:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:25):**  going into hazelnuts and it's going into grazing areas and I had it made sure it went down  
**[1:04:31-1:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:31):**  there when it hit the next like a third swale and berm down I didn't breach that primary  
**[1:04:37-1:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:37):**  valley and then it would get distributed to the ponds or the infiltration zones for that  
**[1:04:42-1:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:42):**  particular swale system so when you have seriously excess rainfall and you're not able to utilize  
**[1:04:49-1:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:49):**  those fields because they're too wet you can simply breach the primary valley crossing  
**[1:04:56-1:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:04:56):**  and then you can cultivate in the direction that makes the water go slightly downhill  
**[1:05:00-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:00):**  off the field in question and so it's easily quote unquote drained which I really don't  
**[1:05:07-1:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:07):**  want to encourage people to drain soil because you need that water however in our case right  
**[1:05:14-1:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:14):**  here we've had you know four years worth of rain in two years hopefully that doesn't mean  
**[1:05:20-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:20):**  we're going to go four years without rain but if it does do that that soil is fully  
**[1:05:27-1:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:27):**  hydrated it's holding the maximum amount of water that it possibly can in its current  
**[1:05:32-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:32):**  condition without being water locked.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:36):**  And the remarkable part is even in this emergency you didn't have to go in and use a big backhoe  
**[1:05:41-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:41):**  or something to breach those berms you were able to do it just with a shovel no?  
**[1:05:46-1:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:46):**  Yeah yep well you know in the the annual crop fields I did on the upper slopes I did it  
**[1:05:51-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:51):**  with the front end loader on my tractor so it was pretty simple.  
**[1:05:56-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:05:56):**  Nice so look we've covered so many things and this is still just a fraction of what  
**[1:06:00-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:00):**  you've gone through in the book in much greater detail but I know that you're also coming  
**[1:06:04-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:04):**  out with a technical manual to accompany the book could you tell us a little bit about  
**[1:06:08-1:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:08):**  what's going to be in there to help people to understand these concepts better?  
**[1:06:12-1:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:12):**  Well so this book Water for Any Farm was written to be read by anybody and understood and give  
**[1:06:19-1:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:19):**  you these visual images that any farmer homesteader rancher can figure out oh okay yeah I can  
**[1:06:26-1:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:26):**  do that and do it safely and effectively and not create more problems than you already  
**[1:06:32-1:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:32):**  have right now.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:33):**  The technical manual goes through in almost painful detail a lot of the engineering diagrams  
**[1:06:44-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:44):**  and specifications and it goes through all of the USDA language and it takes a swale  
**[1:06:51-1:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:51):**  in permaculture language for example and uses USDA language to describe every single part  
**[1:06:56-1:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:06:56):**  of that swale using USDA language and flip-flop that it uses swale language to describe USDA  
**[1:07:04-1:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:04):**  terrace practices and it does it in serious analytical detail it also includes in there  
**[1:07:12-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:12):**  I've mentioned already the VI equation and the HI equation if you're going to be doing  
**[1:07:16-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:16):**  this on your farm you don't necessarily have to use the engineering mathematics to put  
**[1:07:24-1:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:24):**  in a system however it's in your best interest to do your homework do your homework how much  
**[1:07:29-1:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:29):**  rain falls from your sky what is the infiltration rate for your soil types if everything was  
**[1:07:34-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:34):**  working well what are the actual infiltration rates of your soil now because it's probably  
**[1:07:39-1:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:39):**  been farmed incorrectly for who knows how long it has been then how wide of a crop alley  
**[1:07:45-1:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:45):**  should I have in order to minimize the erosion on my property well then how big how deep  
**[1:07:54-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:07:54):**  should the terrace channel be because I will know say a one this one acre field here in  
**[1:08:00-1:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:00):**  a six inch rain there's what's called a design storm event what you do is you use the USDA  
**[1:08:08-1:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:08):**  number for the it's a 10-year it's a 10-year storm event is what all the USDA terrace systems  
**[1:08:19-1:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:19):**  are designed around so that your channels and your terrace berm can hold that 10-year  
**[1:08:26-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:26):**  design storm we typically design to hold a 25-year rain event so what are those numbers  
**[1:08:36-1:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:36):**  what is that number on your property how do you do the calculations to figure out how  
**[1:08:40-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:40):**  deep should my swales be how big should the berm be how wide should the crop alleys be  
**[1:08:46-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:46):**  and okay now we're going to make ponds we're going to make discharges if we're going to  
**[1:08:50-1:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:50):**  make a level sill discharge how long should it be does it need to have a sedimentation  
**[1:08:55-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:08:55):**  pool built on the upstream side of it so the technical manual has all the technical details  
**[1:09:01-1:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:01):**  in there and if I'm not trying to prevent people from buying it but those people who  
**[1:09:09-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:09):**  who get bored to tears with technical reality may not find it an enjoyable read but it will  
**[1:09:17-1:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:17):**  be an informative read and it will help you to design your swale and berm system to comply  
**[1:09:23-1:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:23):**  with USDA and Army Corps of Engineer codes which we really should do that don't go out  
**[1:09:31-1:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:31):**  here and be a rebel and just kind of move dirt all over the place without finding out  
**[1:09:35-1:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:35):**  what the the federal regulations that apply to you the state the local the county the  
**[1:09:40-1:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:40):**  water management district what are the rules that apply to you how can you comply with  
**[1:09:45-1:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:45):**  all those laws whether you like them or not how can you comply with those laws and still  
**[1:09:50-1:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:50):**  accomplish your water management objectives on your property so that's what the technical  
**[1:09:54-1:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:54):**  details on the technical manual goes into it's all black and white no color photographs  
**[1:09:59-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:09:59):**  lots of you know engineering looking diagrams numbers and equations it's it's a beautiful  
**[1:10:04-1:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:04):**  it's a thing to behold excellent hey I mean that's really important stuff especially when  
**[1:10:09-1:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:09):**  doing it on the scale and with the urgency that it needs to be done in the days and years to come  
**[1:10:14-1:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:14):**  I for one have been looking into and researching water harvesting systems earthworks permaculture  
**[1:10:21-1:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:21):**  techniques for a long time and for what it's worth I got a ton out of this I've never had  
**[1:10:26-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:26):**  this explained in such a way that really answered all of the questions and the doubts that I've had  
**[1:10:31-1:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:31):**  and the the points at which I thought some of previous systems and pedagogies were somewhat  
**[1:10:36-1:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:36):**  limited I really recommend this to anybody who still has some questions about water harvesting  
**[1:10:41-1:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:41):**  and earthworks methods so before I let you go Mark could you tell us about some of the other  
**[1:10:49-1:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:49):**  resources and the release date for the technical manual as well as ways that our listeners can get  
**[1:10:54-1:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:10:54):**  in contact with you and your team sure first of all this book water for for any farm um those of  
**[1:11:00-1:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:00):**  you who uh only have like the sixth grade reading level you'd be all right because that's all I can  
**[1:11:06-1:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:06):**  write in is at the sixth grade reading level it's an easy read it's more narrative this is this is  
**[1:11:11-1:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:11):**  what I've done you know it's more of an aw shucks kind of perspective whereas a technical manual  
**[1:11:16-1:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:16):**  is a lot will be a lot more precise language and it's not as enjoyable to read um so uh  
**[1:11:23-1:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:23):**  don't worry about water for any farm it's easy to read it's fun to read um some other resources  
**[1:11:29-1:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:29):**  that you might want to look into look up the usda code just do a internet search for I think I  
**[1:11:36-1:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:36):**  believe it's code 600 which describes terraces and the use of terraces and you'll see right up  
**[1:11:43-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:43):**  front from their definition you know their wordy definition of a terrace it's a swale and a berm  
**[1:11:49-1:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:49):**  then learn their language for what you're doing so look up usda code 600 look up whatever the usda  
**[1:11:58-1:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:11:58):**  code I think it's 300 or 330 on contour farming look up the usda codes online it's all free online  
**[1:12:06-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:06):**  the usda code 590 for making ponds and whatever the one is for grassed waterways and with that  
**[1:12:14-1:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:14):**  right there it's really cool they tell you how to do it and what to do in extraordinary detail  
**[1:12:21-1:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:21):**  well when designing a more complex system that has multiple elements you know multiple of those  
**[1:12:28-1:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:28):**  elements from terraces and swales and berms and discharges and level sills and ponds blah blah  
**[1:12:33-1:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:33):**  if you want some kind of help and assistance you can contact restoration agriculture development  
**[1:12:39-1:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:39):**  restorationag.com and then what we'll do is we can come out and do a basic site assessment  
**[1:12:46-1:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:46):**  and come up with an overall strategy of this is what you can do this is what your current  
**[1:12:52-1:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:52):**  site does this is a potential direction you can go in that's based on the natural plant community  
**[1:12:57-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:12:57):**  types of your area then we can come in later on and plant the agroforestry system because what we  
**[1:13:04-1:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:13:04):**  do is we use the swales and berms the terraces as the pattern that now tells us where to put rows of  
**[1:13:12-1:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:13:12):**  trees and we focus primarily on crop trees and we don't necessarily grow our crop trees chestnuts  
**[1:13:18-1:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:13:18):**  for example or apples we don't grow them as an orchard we grow them as a tree we kind of let them  
**[1:13:23-1:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:13:23):**  let them do their thing and as a bonus we get the benefit of fruits or nuts as an extra yield and it  
**[1:13:32-1:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:13:32):**  does not interfere with our cropping in the alleys in between so those plants that we use the the  
**[1:13:39-1:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:13:39):**  trees that we use come from the forest agriculture nursery at forestag.com f-o-r-e-s-t-a-g.com  
**[1:13:48-1:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:13:48):**  and we're a networked nursery of a number of of small independent accelerated woody crop  
**[1:13:57-1:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:13:57):**  plant breeders and we have folks in most regions of the USA that they're creating land races of  
**[1:14:05-1:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:14:05):**  the specific crop trees with the intention of having them grow in systems with heavy competition  
**[1:14:12-1:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:14:12):**  from pasture grasses weeds etc and minimal inputs as in you know no fertilizers pesticides fungicides  
**[1:14:18-1:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:14:18):**  etc and high yields simultaneously so my personal three that I focus on the most at my own breeding  
**[1:14:29-1:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:14:29):**  site are chestnuts and hazelnuts and pine nuts the pine nuts that I use are Korean pine we also have  
**[1:14:37-1:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:14:37):**  you know access to you know breeders who are working with pinyon pine, Italian pine, Siberian  
**[1:14:43-1:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:14:43):**  pine, we've got folks doing walnut believe it or not we've got walnuts that have survived in  
**[1:14:50-1:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:14:50):**  Wisconsin and are producing walnuts like the California walnut not just black walnut and we've  
**[1:14:56-1:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:14:56):**  got folks that are working on pecan as well the idea here is to have seedling plants not  
**[1:15:03-1:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:03):**  necessarily grafted plants because genetic diversity is actually an advantage in a natural  
**[1:15:09-1:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:09):**  system and when we put a genetic diversity out there if the weather weirds on us it goes strange  
**[1:15:15-1:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:15):**  here and there we will have in our plantings the right genetics to go forward and then we continue  
**[1:15:22-1:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:22):**  to replant and select based on reality we already talked about designing around reality we're  
**[1:15:28-1:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:28):**  growing woody crops food for people based on reality pests are a reality in the world they  
**[1:15:36-1:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:36):**  really are we don't have to fight against them with poisons we're breeding right along with them  
**[1:15:41-1:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:41):**  for resistance diseases are natural and normal they're not a disaster something that happens to  
**[1:15:46-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:46):**  your you know your plants that you have to fight against we breed right along with it for natural  
**[1:15:52-1:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:15:52):**  resistance and so on and so on and so on we're breeding actively forward the varieties that will  
**[1:16:00-1:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:16:00):**  survive our site with the way reality is and so if you're ordering plants from forest ag for example  
**[1:16:08-1:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:16:08):**  we also have the ability now to target you if you just order Chinese chestnuts for example and  
**[1:16:15-1:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:16:15):**  you're in Maine well we'll we choose from our breeders who are up further north with similar  
**[1:16:20-1:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:16:20):**  soil types instead of sending you genetics front that are that are thriving down in Oklahoma for  
**[1:16:25-1:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard/#t=1:16:25):**  example. Yeah perfect man these are some fantastic resources I'm really hoping that this gets out

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:17):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:40):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that anyone  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:06):**  can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves, their families  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:10):**  and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:19):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:20):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:24):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:40):**  Alright friends and family, welcome back!  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:43):**  Now over the last month, I've been focusing on interviews with people who are pioneering  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:47):**  the repair and regeneration of the water cycle as it pertains to landscapes.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:51):**  We've explored the installation of ponds and dams, permaculture earthworks and water retention  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:01:56):**  landscapes as well as keyline design and planting the rain in dry lands.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:01):**  These are all great interventions at the beginning of the water cycle's journey, but today I  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:05):**  want to start a deeper dive, literally, by going into the furthest point downstream,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:10):**  where water enters the ocean.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:13):**  Marine ecosystems are much less understood by the general public for a variety of reasons,  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:18):**  but our actions on land have a direct effect on the health of our oceans too.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:22):**  Luckily, there are incredible teams of people looking to address these issues with promising  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:27):**  new solutions, and over the next couple of episodes I'll be highlighting a few of them.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:32):**  So to get started, I spoke with Joost Wouders, an entrepreneur, speaker, author, and the  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:36):**  CEO of this seaweed company.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:39):**  I got to know Joost first as a co-instructor with me on the Ecosystem Restoration Design  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:43):**  course through Gaia Education, and I was fascinated with his presentation and the compelling data  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:49):**  on the potential regenerative effects that seaweed and kelp can have in bringing back  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:53):**  the health of coastal areas.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:02:56):**  In his role with the seaweed company, he and his team aim to implement CO2-reducing seaweed-based  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:00):**  business models at a large scale.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:04):**  It turns out that seaweed is the fastest-growing biomass in the world.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:08):**  Seaweed farming itself, if done responsibly, has the power to address many of the ecological  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:12):**  challenges that we face today, without the use of land, fertilizer, or even fresh water.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:19):**  It reduces ocean acidification, promotes marine biodiversity, and even absorbs vast quantities  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:24):**  of CO2 from the atmosphere.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:27):**  Seaweed can also create highly valuable end products.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:30):**  It's a nutritious source of food for both people and animals, and can be used as an  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:34):**  environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-based fertilizers and plastics.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:38):**  At the moment, it's a unique untapped resource, and the goal for the seaweed company is to  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:43):**  unlock the potential of this wondrous resource to benefit both people and the planet.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:48):**  In this episode, Yos starts by explaining some of the urgent issues facing marine environments  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:53):**  and how seaweed farming can help to address them.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:03:56):**  We go over the advantages that growing seaweed has over terrestrial agriculture, the high-value  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:01):**  products that can be made from different types of seaweed, the many pilot projects around  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:05):**  the world that his company has helped to start, and much more.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:09):**  Towards the end, we also examine the roadblocks that are holding back this solution from being  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:13):**  more widely adopted, and how those of you listening can learn more and even get involved.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:19):**  I've personally been learning a lot about marine ecosystems through these interviews,  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:24):**  and truly hope that a greater awareness will begin to be built around just how essential  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:28):**  the health of our oceans is to the health of all life, even to ecosystems that are far  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:33):**  inland and away from any saltwater.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:36):**  I'm really excited for this and the next few episodes for exactly this reason, so I'll  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:40):**  hand things over now to Yos.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:42):**  Hey Yos, thanks so much for taking the time to be with me today.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:45):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:46):**  I'm doing very well, thank you Oliver.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:47):**  Well look, I'm excited to get into talking about the world of ocean farming, seeing as  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:52):**  we're just on the beginning frontier of this area, but let's start by going into what sort  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:04:58):**  of problems that our oceans currently have that farming seaweed can help to resolve.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:04):**  Well, the oceans are quite under some stress I would say, for different reasons.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:11):**  So of course we have lots of activities in the ocean, like oil and all kind of stuff  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:20):**  that is polluting the ocean, that puts the ocean and the marine life under stress.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:26):**  And apart from that you have human activities on land, so all the agricultural activities  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:32):**  where you have all the nutrients from fertilizer that go into the sea and make sure that the  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:39):**  sea gets almost over-nutrified.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:45):**  And then of course you have the whole CO2 issue where the sea is absorbing quite a lot  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:50):**  of that and that leads to acidification of the ocean.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:05:53):**  So from different sides the ocean is under stress and I've just mentioned not even all  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:01):**  of them.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:03):**  Seaweed is able to, I mean seaweed could be one of the, let's say, solutions or one of  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:10):**  the contributors to at least take off that stress to ease that a bit.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:18):**  One of the biggest benefits of seaweed is it's the fastest growing biomass on this planet,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:23):**  so it is absorbing a lot of CO2, therefore helping the oceans to tackle this acidification.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:33):**  Seaweed eats the nutrients, the excess of nutrients that is there in the sea.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:39):**  So seaweed could play quite a role in relieving that stress a little bit.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:46):**  And given that a lot of these contaminants and the stress on the oceans, as you put it,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:50):**  is coming from operations and contaminants based on land, is it just a matter of these  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:06:56):**  working as a biofilter or are they performing other ecosystem services as they grow as well?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:04):**  Well that is basically what you see.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:08):**  So apart from what I just said, the absorption of nutrients and CO2, what you see happening  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:16):**  around seaweed farms is that it forms kind of habitat for marine life, which is of course  
**[0:07:22-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:22):**  makes sense, you're growing plants or underwater and you get a lot of marine life reappearing.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:31):**  So that is quite a positive side effect or whatever effect it is that you get on top  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:38):**  of it.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:39):**  So, but I would not say that growing seaweed acts as a filter to counterbalance the damage  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:46):**  that we're doing on land.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:48):**  It just happens to work like that and I think we should do both.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:52):**  We should not grow seaweeds to counterbalance all the negative effects.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:07:56):**  I mean we should stop with that and we should embrace all the positive things that seaweed  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:02):**  has to bring.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:03):**  So it seems to me that there's a lot of potential here economically as well from some of the  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:10):**  research and the talks that I've seen you give in the past.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:12):**  Can you tell me about some of the valuable seaweed products that have a potential market  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:18):**  in a regular economy?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:20):**  Yeah, well that makes the seaweed solution actually quite an interesting one.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:25):**  So on one hand, knowing that you have the fastest growing biomass, that has a lot of  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:29):**  positive side effects on the environment.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:31):**  On the other hand, seaweed has many, many valuable applications.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:38):**  So if you look at the seaweed at the plant, then it starts with the, let's say the macro  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:45):**  elements in it.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:46):**  So you have fibrous proteins and carbs.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:49):**  Well probably everyone knows what to do with that.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:51):**  So they could replace other proteins.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:08:54):**  It could be an alternative for fiber, for fibers.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:00):**  And the carbs are quite interesting because they are insoluble.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:04):**  So when you eat them, you feel filled, but the carbs will not act the same as for instance  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:13):**  the carbs in pasta or in bread.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:15):**  But then if you take a microscope, you go even deeper, you go to the bioactive ingredients,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:22):**  then it becomes really interesting.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:24):**  So what you see is that seaweed has many active ingredients that if you extract them, that  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:33):**  lead to a couple of things.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:38):**  One of them is that you could say that seaweed helps to improve the immune system, but not  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:44):**  only for humans, but also for animals and even also for the soil, for agriculture.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:50):**  So increasing the immune system of the soil.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:53):**  And that makes seaweed extremely interesting.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:09:55):**  And the mode of action is different in all the situations, but we see very nice and impressive  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:03):**  results there.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:05):**  If you have a lot of seaweed and you have it available in high quantities and lower  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:09):**  price, then you get into applications as plastics.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:13):**  You could serve as a biomass for plastics and also for energy.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:18):**  Having said that, I think that seaweed is so valuable for human and animal and soil  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:25):**  applications that before we use it for biomass, as biomass for energy, that will take some  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:31):**  time, but it is a possibility.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:34):**  So that is just a couple of possible things that you can do with seaweed.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:38):**  And of course, most of them have a value or basically all of them have a value.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:42):**  The value differs, of course.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:44):**  Energy is less value than, for instance, human food or even pharmaceutical or human wellbeing  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:55):**  products.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:10:56):**  But that makes it an interesting portfolio of applications.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:02):**  And so then what's holding this back as an industry at the moment?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:05):**  Because I know seaweed products are much more common in, say, Asian and South Asian diets.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:11):**  But here in Europe and in the United States, where I mostly grew up, it's not nearly as  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:16):**  common.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:17):**  Is it just a matter of cultural differences or is there something else holding the industry  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:20):**  back at the moment?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:21):**  Well, I think cultural difference is one.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:24):**  So we have, let's say, lost the connection with what happens in the sea.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:28):**  What you see in Europe and the US, the coastal communities still know about seaweed and they  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:36):**  still use it for different purposes.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:38):**  But the industry has disappeared in a way.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:42):**  And we are kind of exploring what's happening.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:47):**  It's not new, but it's just not known.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:50):**  We don't look underwater.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:51):**  We never consider that to be a place for a raw material like seaweed, a valuable raw  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:57):**  material.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:11:59):**  Well, you're correct.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:02):**  In this moment, I would say that 95% or even more of the global volume is produced in Asia  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:10):**  and also used there for extraction of some binding agents and also for food.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:16):**  But it's safe to say that outside of Asia, there is just no seaweed, definitely not enough  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:23):**  seaweed.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:25):**  So the world can benefit from all its positive applications.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:32):**  So let's talk about now a different approach to treating this as an agricultural product.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:37):**  Because like you said, though this is not new as a product, it is new the way you're  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:42):**  going about cultivating it.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:44):**  Can you tell me how you actually grow seaweed in the ocean?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:48):**  Yeah, so what you'll see, what the seaweed that was produced or harvested would be the  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:12:56):**  correct word so far in Europe and the US, that was all taking place in like wild harvesting.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:04):**  So people are just collecting it from the shores.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:07):**  Now, that is not a real sustainable way of doing it.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:10):**  So we try to cultivate it.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:13):**  And then we enter in the technological challenges here.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:20):**  Because you try to grow something in open water with quite hefty circumstances like  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:27):**  currents and waves and what have you.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:31):**  But basically what it comes down to, you need to produce, let's say, seaweed seedlings,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:37):**  so the base material.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:39):**  They need to find a way to attach that to growth structures.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:44):**  In our case, we use ropes and nets.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:48):**  Then you need to build an infrastructure in the sea that you can connect these ropes and  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:53):**  nets to and that withstands the forces of nature.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:13:59):**  Then you get to the point where it is ready for harvesting.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:03):**  Then you need to find a way to harvest it.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:05):**  And very important, a way of processing it in a very short time frame.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:10):**  So seaweed, if you take it out of the water, after about one hour, it is already disintegrating.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:17):**  So there are quite some challenges that lead to the current situation that we are still  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:23):**  in a very immature industry, I would say.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:27):**  Well, so at the moment we've been talking about seaweed as if it's just one thing.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:31):**  But I know you've identified a number of different seaweed species in a presentation that I've  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:35):**  seen of yours recently and the different potential marketable products that can be brought from  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:41):**  each as well as the different climates that they require to grow in.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:45):**  Can you go over some of the ones that you've explored most for their potential in farming?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:51):**  Yeah, that's a good question because indeed we are talking about seaweed as if it was  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:57):**  just one thing.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:14:59):**  And it would be the same as if we talk about trees or herbs.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:02):**  If we are trying to make a meal, no one is putting herbs in a meal.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:06):**  Garlic or other herbs with specific names.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:12):**  So basically if you look at seaweed, there are three different categories.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:17):**  You have green, brown and red seaweeds.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:21):**  Those are the main categories.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:25):**  The brown seaweeds, sometimes also called kelp, you find them mainly in the colder water.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:33):**  So mainly northern Europe, US, Canada, along the coast of Chile, there you find the kelp,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:45):**  the brown seaweeds.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:48):**  These seaweeds require also a completely different way of cultivating than, for instance, the  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:53):**  green seaweeds because the green seaweeds, one well known species called sea lettuce  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:15:59):**  or ulva, that is for instance a free floating seaweed.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:04):**  So it's not connecting to anything.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:07):**  So you cannot put it on a line or a net.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:09):**  So that requires a completely different way of cultivating, for instance, in ponds or  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:14):**  in closed areas.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:17):**  And then finally you have the red seaweeds and generally speaking, those are growing  
**[0:16:23-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:23):**  in warmer climates like Asia, Indonesia, India.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:31):**  And they have yet another way of growing.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:33):**  You could growth.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:34):**  It's like you can take pieces of the seaweed and then the plant grows out of that and you  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:40):**  can harvest part of the plant and reuse the bit that is left.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:46):**  So that is roughly the three species and then you have different names and different species  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:51):**  within these groups.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:54):**  So within those categories that you mentioned, what have been the ones that you have so far  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:58):**  found success in cultivating?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:16:59):**  Yeah, that's a good thing to realize.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:03):**  There are roughly, we know of about 17,000 different species of seaweed all around the  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:10):**  world.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:11):**  And I think that is still missing many, many, many other species that we just don't know  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:17):**  of or we can't identify as a separate species.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:21):**  Now, of those species, I think there is a maximum of 10 to 15 species that are commercially  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:28):**  used and have therefore also a known way of, let's say, cultivating them.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:36):**  That's not a lot.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:38):**  We focus mainly in Ireland on a species called Alaria that is a very tasty brown seaweed.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:49):**  In the North Sea, in the Netherlands, we grow Saccharina, or sugarweed.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:53):**  Then in our plant in Morocco, we grow a green seaweed, Ulva, or sea lettuce.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:17:59):**  And then in our farms in India, we focus on mainly on Gracilaria, and that is a red seaweed.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:07):**  And all of these we use in our application.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:12):**  So one is not better than the other or more useful.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:17):**  So we make use of all of them in our lands.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:22):**  And so I've worked in both commercial fishing and commercial shipping.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:28):**  And I know that doing work in the ocean requires some pretty intensive capital investments  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:34):**  for the equipment, for the fuel costs.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:37):**  Is this something that would be possible for someone without that kind of financial backing  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:41):**  to start on if they were living close to the ocean?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:44):**  Or is it something that you really kind of need a coalition and a team of investors to  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:48):**  get off the ground or off the water, so to speak?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:52):**  Well, that depends a little bit.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:18:54):**  If you live on the coast, close to the coast, and there is, let's say, a secluded area,  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:01):**  non-exposed area like a bay, then it's very well possible to start a small farm there.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:07):**  I mean, in the Netherlands, there is a team of people who are growing seaweed in a harbor.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:14):**  So just between two little piers, they have some ropes, and they grow seaweed there.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:20):**  So that's very small scale but doable.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:22):**  If you like it as a hobby or if you like it, you can get it to a certain scale.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:31):**  But it is not about the volumes that we are talking about.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:34):**  And for those, you do need capital because it's quite capital in terms, as you mentioned.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:44):**  Apart from that, you do need some skills.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:46):**  You do need the right equipment.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:47):**  You do need to write to vessels.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:51):**  The sea skills, you need to know what to do.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:19:55):**  So if you don't have any background in, let's say, in any sea or aquaculture related activity,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:03):**  then I would definitely make sure that you hire or find someone who has, like a mussel  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:08):**  farmer or a fish farmer or someone who works offshore.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:13):**  And that is what we found in the seaweed company.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:16):**  We have combined those skills.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:18):**  So we combined the biological knowledge with the engineering knowledge and the financial  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:26):**  knowledge.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:27):**  So bringing those three together, that's a good mix of starting a seaweed adventure,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:32):**  I would say.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:33):**  And so I know you've mentioned these different cultivated species in different areas where  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:38):**  the climate is appropriate for the needs of the plant.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:43):**  But does this really work out as just another way of monoculture farming just in the ocean?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:50):**  Or is there enough of a diversity of, I guess, other plant and wildlife in these systems  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:20:56):**  that creates an actual habitat for other ecological systems like we spoke about in the beginning?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:04):**  Well, the risk, of course, is always there, to be honest.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:07):**  And that's what you see right now in Asia.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:09):**  It's quite a monocultural activity that explains, which is a pity.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:15):**  I mean, there's enough lessons that we could learn from what we're doing on land.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:20):**  So what we try to do in our farms is to approach it from a sustainable point of view and work  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:27):**  with nature.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:30):**  And of course, it will always be a combination of optimizing your operation.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:34):**  But optimizing your operation does not say that you only focus on one species.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:40):**  Luckily, you do have many species that grow together.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:43):**  And you have quite some complementary activities if you include other, let's say, agricultural  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:49):**  products.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:50):**  Why is it an animal like shellfish?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:55):**  Or you include those activities.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:21:58):**  They have a very beneficial effect on each other.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:01):**  So seaweed feeds, for instance, on the waste of fish farms or mussels or oysters and the  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:11):**  other way around.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:12):**  So it's quite easy to create positive ecosystems around a seaweed farm.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:18):**  And that is, of course, what we try.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:20):**  Now having said that, the seas and the oceans are so immense that we are not even close  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:29):**  there.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:30):**  So it's good to mention.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:32):**  It is a possibility.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:33):**  And it's also good to realize that right now it's just a couple of pixels in the water  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:39):**  that we have.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:43):**  And yeah, the sea is quite large so far.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:48):**  It can absorb a lot.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:22:53):**  Before we have just, let's say, regenerated all the forests, all the kelp, all the seaweed  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:00):**  that has just disappeared because of pollution, I think if we only get to that point and then  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:06):**  we just bring back nature as it was, then that will take many years to get there.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:12):**  Well, so I love that you've talked about this as a large scale potential application.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:16):**  Can you share with us sort of the vision that you have for the benefits that this could  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:22):**  bring to our culture, to our diets, and other ways if it's really implemented at the scale  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:28):**  you're talking about?  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:29):**  Well, I think that what you will see then is that the seaweed extracts, as I discussed  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:36):**  in the beginning, will be used in many food and feed ingredients.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:42):**  We will see a community, human and animal, with an improved immune system.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:48):**  That means less vulnerable to infections or even viruses as we see right now.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:56):**  Less use of antibiotics.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:23:59):**  We are doing tests with hospitals right now and with medical universities where we test  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:05):**  the effect on diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:11):**  We do see that seaweed has many, many, or let's say it correctly, that several species  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:17):**  have the ability to have big effects in the situations.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:23):**  Because that's the thing, it's not seaweed in general.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:26):**  That might be the trap.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:29):**  Having said that, we're not talking about huge volumes that people or animals need to  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:36):**  consume.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:37):**  I mean, for a human being, it would be extremely healthy if you would eat five grams of dried  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:43):**  seaweed per day and put that in whatever meal you're preparing.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:47):**  That is more than enough.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:48):**  For animals, the same.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:50):**  For our cows, we are looking at about 70 grams per day that we blend as a supplement in the  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:24:57):**  total feed that they eat in a day.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:00):**  That is tens of kilograms.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:04):**  It's not about eating a lot of it.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:06):**  It's just giving your body the benefits that it brings so the seaweed can improve your  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:16):**  gut health and your immune system.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:18):**  That's where we'll see it back.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:20):**  Then of course, if the scale increases or if we have seaweed that cannot be used for  
**[0:25:25-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:25):**  human or animal feed and we start using it for, let's say, for plastics, for biomass  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:35):**  or for energy, then it will replace fossil fuel-based products right now.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:41):**  It will be alternative for that or if we use it as a growth stimulant, it can replace fossil  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:48):**  fuel-based fertilizer, pesticide.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:25:53):**  I think as humanity, we will or as being on this planet, you will notice that if we achieve  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:00):**  the scale that we have, whether it be in fishing.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:02):**  If I say we, I'm not talking of course about only the seaweed company, but I hope that  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:08):**  this inspires many people to start a seaweed adventure because we do need a lot of seaweed.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:14):**  One of the things that I think could be an unintended positive consequence from this  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:19):**  is if people start having a closer relationship to seaweed products and other things that  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:23):**  come out of the ocean that aren't simply extracted, like fishing and seafood industries have us  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:30):**  relating to it, perhaps they'll think more about their impact on non-terrestrial landscapes  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:36):**  as well and create a connection between our actions here on land and the impacts that  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:43):**  they have in the ocean.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:45):**  I'm wondering, how did you first get interested in getting involved with an endeavor like  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:51):**  this?  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:52):**  Did you have an early connection to ocean environments or did this come from a different  
**[0:26:56-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:56):**  interest?  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:26:57):**  No, actually, a nice question.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:01):**  To be honest, I was not connected in any way or had any relationship with the sea before  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:06):**  I started.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:07):**  No, after some of my career adventures, I felt like I would like to have tangible impact.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:14):**  I would like to work with something in some area that has a tangible impact.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:21):**  I'm not talking about it or not thinking about it or having the intention to change things,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:27):**  but to really do it.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:29):**  And basically, what I did is I invited myself, I went to my LinkedIn list and I invited myself  
**[0:27:36-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:36):**  to several people that were working in the sustainable industry, like solar panels or  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:44):**  batteries or wind power or wave current power.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:48):**  And I thought, okay, that's all nice and that is very important.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:53):**  And that's almost already in a commodity phase.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:27:57):**  And then I ran into someone who mentioned seaweed and what you could do with it.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:00):**  And I don't know what happened, but immediately I fell in love with it.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:04):**  And I thought, this is extremely interesting.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:08):**  This is something I would like to find out.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:10):**  The more you dive into it and the more I was learning and the more people I was meeting,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:18):**  the clearer it became.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:20):**  This will be my future.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:22):**  And the rest is history.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:25):**  Well, so I've only really started to hear about the potential of ocean farming in this  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:33):**  sense in the last handful of years.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:36):**  And I'm wondering, are the different people who are pioneering this sector of not just  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:43):**  removing fish and wildlife from the sea, but actually cultivating things in a beyond sustainable  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:50):**  way, are you all in close contact?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:52):**  Do you share resources?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:53):**  Are there places where you can go to get the latest information or are people still mostly  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:28:59):**  operating independently?  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:00):**  Yeah, it's the latter, unfortunately, but I think that there's a natural approach when  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:05):**  whatever, if it's on land or in the sea or when people try to change systems, they quickly  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:12):**  find out that you cannot change the system.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:15):**  The only thing what you can do is you can build a new system next to it and show to  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:21):**  people, demonstrate to people that that works as well or that works better.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:26):**  Now what that results into is that you are quite a pioneer and a loner at some point  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:33):**  because the rest of the world does not understand you yet or the legislation is not there yet  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:40):**  or the banks don't know what to do with you because you don't fit in any box.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:45):**  So you probably in the beginning are very busy with surviving and trying to get your  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:51):**  ideas on board and that leaves not a lot of time to find each other.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:29:56):**  I think it will take place and of course it is taking place as well in the different countries.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:01):**  There is a seaweed initiative now in Europe and Netherlands and you do see people around  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:08):**  certain themes connecting and that will only grow.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:14):**  But yeah, I think this makes it also interesting.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:17):**  It is for me, the pioneering phase is just fantastic.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:21):**  It is now finding the partners in any industry that we need that just have the vision that  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:27):**  we need to change.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:28):**  So now it is meeting the banks that are open to that.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:32):**  Well, let's say it is one out of ten and then it is looking at the offshore companies.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:37):**  Well it is one out of five that is open to a new future.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:43):**  And that is great because now those companies and those organizations meet and they form  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:47):**  coalitions.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:48):**  Yeah, I have to say that it becomes stronger and stronger.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:30:52):**  So you are right, the last five years I would say these initiatives are popping up and people  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:02):**  are just reacting positive to that.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:05):**  That is a positive effect I would say.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:09):**  That is really exciting.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:10):**  And just to kind of wrap up this picture here, can you tell me a little bit about the steps  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:16):**  that were involved for you to get your initial project off the ground?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:20):**  Because obviously it has expanded quite a bit.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:22):**  I can't imagine that you started in all these countries at the same time.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:26):**  But to give a bit of a roadmap for someone who might be interested in launching their  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:31):**  own enterprise along this route, can you give me an idea of the steps that it took to get  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:36):**  where you are at now?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:38):**  I think it starts with getting clear on your ambition and your passion.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:43):**  So what you see, especially in seaweed, is that either you are really, you like it and  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:49):**  you would like to build your farm in your local community.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:54):**  So you want to keep it small scale.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:31:57):**  And that could be very, very nice.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:01):**  And then you can do it with little resources.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:05):**  Or if you have ambitions that you want to, let's say, grow or start an industry.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:12):**  If it's the latter, like in our case, then you need to make sure that first of all, check  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:16):**  that you're crazy enough, stubborn enough, because just counting the times and moments  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:22):**  that would be more than logical to stop.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:26):**  We could justify really already 10 times that we would have stopped on our way, but we didn't.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:32):**  So you must be quite determined to continue.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:37):**  And then it's really about finding the right people and the right attitudes.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:40):**  It's not so much about the technology and the finance and the biology.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:48):**  All that knowledge is already there.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:51):**  It is about finding the right people with the right attitudes that can bring it together  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:55):**  and act in the same way.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:57):**  And then it can go pretty fast.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:32:59):**  So we started with one farm in Ireland.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:05):**  And we found we built a kind of ecosystem around that.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:08):**  So we worked with a local contractor and we found the right people.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:12):**  And in the beginning, we would just improvise things with our materials.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:19):**  What we did is we tested everything already for skill.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:23):**  So we were not testing just one thing and then see how it worked and then see the next  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:27):**  year how it would continue.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:28):**  Now we were already testing on the skill that other people had there, let's say the size  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:36):**  of their operations.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:38):**  And therefore we could make huge steps.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:40):**  So after one farm in Ireland, the second popped up and the third, and we have a big hatchery  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:45):**  where we grow our base material.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:48):**  And then an opportunity in Morocco started and we met someone.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:52):**  So it's always finding every new operation starts with one or two persons that we meet  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:33:59):**  and that form the right fit and have the right attitude and share the same ambition.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:04):**  And then they can almost set it up there locally and make it a growing business there.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:12):**  So what we need to let go of is that we control everything.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:17):**  So it's really like our company is also growing organically in a way.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:20):**  Morocco is growing in a certain speed in India and Ireland and I don't know what other farms  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:27):**  will, operations will, will, will, will root.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:32):**  You need to be able to be okay with that, I think.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:35):**  And then, and then it can go pretty fast.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:37):**  So in two years time now we, was it two years, two and a half years, we have grown out to  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:43):**  about 16 people and five or six farms we are working on.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:49):**  We're attracting quite some attention from governments, from, from communities.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:55):**  Then you end up in a kind of positive spiral.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:57):**  Wow.  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:34:59):**  It really sounds like collaboration has been key to this effort because there's so many  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:03):**  arms of the operation.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:06):**  And I guess what I'm wondering is seen as this is really pushing the boundaries of agriculture  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:11):**  and aquaculture as well.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:14):**  Are you collaborating with universities or research operations in order to study the  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:20):**  outcomes of what you're doing?  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:22):**  Or are there ways for people to come and help out and perhaps get training in these operations  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:27):**  in order to learn more?  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:28):**  Well, that would be ideal of course.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:31):**  But having said that, we're still in, in, in a kind of pioneering phase.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:37):**  So it's not like we are not a big corporate organization that has the luxury to, yeah,  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:45):**  to spend a lot of time and to train people.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:49):**  So the training is always on the job if you want to train and it's very much, yeah, triggered  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:55):**  by the person, him or herself.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:35:59):**  If you don't take the initiative, nothing will happen.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:02):**  What else?  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:03):**  Can you repeat the second part of the question?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:06):**  Sure.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:07):**  So as far as, because this is so new, where are you finding people who have the skills  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:11):**  or finding ways of training people to the skills that are kind of unprecedented up until  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:18):**  now?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:19):**  Or is it just a matter of kind of finding people with related abilities that you can  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:24):**  redirect into the context of what you're trying to accomplish?  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:28):**  No, I think one of our approaches, we never look for people.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:32):**  We never have vacancies.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:35):**  People come to us.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:36):**  We need platforms like this where we can share our message and then most people will listen  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:43):**  to it and will think nice.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:45):**  And then there might be two or three that say like, wow, this is me.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:49):**  This is what I want.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:51):**  And they come to us.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:53):**  And I think that's happening all the time.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:36:55):**  And I think it's a very healthy way of growing because if we would be on the lookout for  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:02):**  people then, yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:05):**  We need to convince people.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:06):**  I don't know.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:07):**  We have to waken something up.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:09):**  So we try to work only with people who want to work with seaweed and have a passion for  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:14):**  that whatever, regardless.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:17):**  And yeah, that leads to great results.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:21):**  Now from the previous interviews that I've done in this podcast, as well as my own experience  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:27):**  working on farms and managing a permaculture farm in Guatemala before coming to live here  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:31):**  in Spain, one of the things that I think is often not understood in agriculture is that  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:37):**  it's not difficult to create a product, to create a produce or grow something.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:43):**  But finding a market for it and creating a value added product for that market is much  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:49):**  more the difficulty.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:51):**  And this is really where the business skills come in.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:54):**  How have you started to figure that out for the products that, like you said, are not  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:37:58):**  very common in many of the markets that you're looking to enter?  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:03):**  Well, that's one thing that we bring in our, let's say, combined skills is apart from the  
**[0:38:10-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:10):**  biology side and knowing what seaweed can do and what ingredient can lead to what effect,  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:18):**  we bring in, of course, a lot of commercial marketing experience.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:24):**  And so the way we look at them, we made some decisions.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:28):**  We said, like, we will never be a, let's say, a seaweed farmer who grows seaweed and sells  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:35):**  seaweed.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:36):**  We will only sell, let's say, products or propositions or concepts where our seaweed  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:42):**  is part of.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:45):**  And that means because we know the moment we are already, let's say, supporting a new  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:51):**  industry moving immediately into commodity and in discussions about margins, that's not  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:57):**  going to help it.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:38:58):**  So we know that our role in Europe is to keep a premium price but find the concepts that  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:04):**  justify that.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:05):**  So it's not only asking a high price, but it's more like finding all the benefits and  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:11):**  creating clear propositions of what seaweed can do.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:15):**  So people are willing to pay for that because they know if I pay this amount for that product,  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:21):**  my return will be 300% or something like that.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:26):**  And that is indeed the biggest, one of the biggest challenges is to constantly create  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:35):**  leading propositions.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:37):**  And then in each industry, find the key people or the leading people.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:41):**  And those are not necessarily the biggest one or the market leaders, definitely not  
**[0:39:46-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:46):**  because they are so driven and focused on price and on commodity.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:53):**  It's more the in-between companies that have a vision they want to change and those are  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:39:58):**  the great partners.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:00):**  And then you need only one or two in each industry and together you create and you pave  
**[0:40:07-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:07):**  that path.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:08):**  So that's basically our approach so far.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:10):**  And of course, we attract a lot of demand right now and that makes it also interesting  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:16):**  for smaller farmers to just link up with us.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:19):**  So we buy as well seaweed as long as it's grown, certified in a sustainable way, we  
**[0:40:26-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:26):**  buy that from smaller farmers and we can use it in our markets.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:34):**  And that's of course a benefit if you focus on that because we have the demand for a lot  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:41):**  of seaweed.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:42):**  This is all fascinating but I got to ask, what of the products that you've seen come  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:47):**  out of seaweed or perhaps even your own products are you really personally excited about or  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:52):**  do you use on a regular basis?  
**[0:40:55-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:40:55):**  Well I eat every day seaweed anyway so I put it in my dried blend of seaweed and I put  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:03):**  it in my smoothies or in my food or in my soup.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:07):**  So that's not really a product, that's more like raw seaweed.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:12):**  I am extremely enthusiastic about our sustainable farming line, what we have.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:18):**  So we are now basically using the sea to improve what we do on land and I like that concept  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:25):**  a lot.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:26):**  So we have different blends for different animals, for cows and pigs and chickens to  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:35):**  really improve the welfare of those animals.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:38):**  And that leads to extremely impressive results like no more antibiotics, reduced stress and  
**[0:41:48-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:48):**  therefore no injuries and quite some nasty things that happen that we tackle.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:41:59):**  And apart from that, for the agricultural side on the land we have our bio-growth stimulant  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:05):**  and that is also what I just said in the beginning, it's like an immune boost for the soil.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:12):**  The soil becomes richer, it can absorb more CO2.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:16):**  But the plant hormones in seaweed help the plant to grow faster and have stronger roots  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:23):**  and be more resistant to stress like heat and droughts as well as it prevents some fungi  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:31):**  to release that toxin.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:32):**  So our product can be almost a replacement for fertilizers and pesticides.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:38):**  Well that is making me extremely happy because then that's like those are the problems that  
**[0:42:43-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:43):**  we are facing right now of our land based optimization approach where we see the borders  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:54):**  or where we have already crossed the borders.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:42:57):**  I think we can bring quite some relief there.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:00):**  As well as we do in the oceans, we can relieve the stress on our land use and the way we  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:05):**  treat and deal with our animals.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:08):**  And yeah, that's definitely one that makes me very happy.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:12):**  And of course, I love that we make chips and we make cheese and bread with seaweed and  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:16):**  that's also very nice.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:18):**  But if I look at the products and our proposition, it has a really big impact, then it's our  
**[0:43:24-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:24):**  sustainable farming approach.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:26):**  Wow, that's really interesting.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:29):**  Are any of these available for purchase in regular markets yet or do they have to be  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:33):**  ordered specially?  
**[0:43:35-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:35):**  Well you can have a look at our website, theseaweedcompany.com if you look at our brands that we have, but  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:41):**  we don't sell them to the public.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:46):**  So we really work in partnerships.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:51):**  Because we think that's important also to get the value out of the product.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:43:55):**  If we would just sell it to someone, then he or she would use it in the wrong way or  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:00):**  not right.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:02):**  So we really want to guide that.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:03):**  So we work with a couple of partners that have the skill and the ability and they are  
**[0:44:08-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:08):**  in the good position that they have access to it and can benefit from it.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:17):**  But of course, our aim is that we make it available sooner than later for bigger use.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:25):**  That's our plan.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:27):**  Very exciting.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:28):**  Do you think you're on track to be able to reach a significant portion of the market  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:33):**  soon or is it going to be a few years or a couple of different milestones in your production  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:37):**  to be able to get up to the scale that you're trying to get to?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:40):**  Well we don't have a goal there on our scale.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:43):**  We just know that speed and skill in general is something we are after.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:48):**  We don't have the luxury, if you look at the state of the planet, we don't have the luxury  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:44:54):**  to wait or to be slow or to test everything to death or to have all the regulations crossed  
**[0:45:01-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:01):**  and ticked.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:02):**  So we need the speed and we need the skill to have the impact.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:05):**  So I mean if we would put ourselves a goal, then who could tell us it wasn't the right  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:10):**  goal?  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:11):**  Maybe we were just under aiming or I don't know.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:16):**  So we don't look at it from that perspective.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:17):**  I would call that old way thinking.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:19):**  That is like talking in competition or a piece of the market.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:23):**  We are creating a new industry and it's not so difficult.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:29):**  If I talk to a farmer who is spraying every five days pesticides over his fields to protect  
**[0:45:36-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:36):**  his potatoes from a certain fungi and he uses gas masks to protect himself and I ask him,  
**[0:45:46-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:46):**  are you putting that over your field?  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:49):**  And are we eating that?  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:51):**  I suppose there would be an alternative that would be safe.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:55):**  Would you use it?  
**[0:45:56-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:56):**  Oh yeah, immediately.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:45:58):**  And that is the way we, that is what I hope that happens.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:01):**  People start thinking.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:05):**  Right now we use certain fertilizers and then if you put it over your land, then the horses  
**[0:46:12-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:12):**  cannot eat their graze there for two weeks.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:14):**  Why not?  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:15):**  Because it's dangerous.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:16):**  Why do you put something over your land that is dangerous?  
**[0:46:19-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:19):**  I mean, I don't get that.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:22):**  I think that we offer a very nice alternative that will, that people see the benefits from  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:28):**  very quickly as soon as they see that the results are at least the same or, and especially  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:34):**  if the results are even better than their alternative they're using.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:39):**  Well before I go, can you tell us how people can get in touch with you, learn more about  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:43):**  your operation and find out more about your products?  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:48):**  I think the easiest way, well you get a little glimpse of what we're doing is on our website.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:55):**  It's www.theseaweedcompany.com.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:46:58):**  Yeah, that's the first step.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:03):**  And the other, I would say if you Google and you go, you look for the different seaweed  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:09):**  stories that are there and the applications you'll find a lot.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:15):**  And yeah, that would be a way to start.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:19):**  And then the people that really want to continue their career and to see, we didn't know how  
**[0:47:25-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:25):**  to find them.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:26):**  No problem.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:27):**  There you go.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:28):**  I'm not going to tell them.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:29):**  All right to you with sea adventurers, you know who to contact if you want to get into  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:32):**  the seaweed business.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:35):**  Well Jils, thank you so much for taking the time.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:36):**  I've really gotten a lot out of the presentations that you did in the ecosystem restoration  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:40):**  design course.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:41):**  And I'm really excited to be co-teaching with you on that.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:45):**  Yeah, it's really exciting the applications and the future possibilities for seaweed farming  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:51):**  and changing our relationship with the ocean in general.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:55):**  So thank you so much for taking the time.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:47:57):**  You're welcome.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/joost-wouters/#t=0:48:00):**  All right, that wraps things up for this week's episode.

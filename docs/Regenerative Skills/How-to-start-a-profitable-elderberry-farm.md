**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:00:59):**  to you in creepy ways.

**[0:01:04-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:04):**  Just find the link to the Discord chat on the homepage at RegenerativeSkills.com.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:14):**  Since I first arrived in the northeast of Spain a year and a half ago, I've been obsessed  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:18):**  with getting to know the native plants in my area.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:21):**  I've been blown away by just how many edible and medicinal plants are all around me and  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:26):**  growing in the most unlikely places, from cracks in the concrete, the edges of parking  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:31):**  lots to erosion gullies and even whole forests of rosemary and thyme.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:36):**  I'm sure anyone who's studied plant medicines knows that some of the most resilient and  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:40):**  persistent pioneer plants that conventional gardeners are always at war with also happen  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:45):**  to be some of the most potent medicines and nutritious foods.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:50):**  One in particular that I found growing in some really harsh conditions was elderberry.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:01:55):**  When I first arrived in August, a lot of the bushes were transitioning from flower to fruit  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:00):**  and I took the opportunity to harvest some, not really knowing how I was going to process  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:04):**  it.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:05):**  But luckily I found some help from books and friends in my network who had more experience  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:09):**  and I ended up making enough elderberry syrup to last me until now and all of the pandemic  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:15):**  paranoia of self-medicating at the first sign of a stuffy nose that came in between.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:21):**  For that reason, I was thrilled to see an old buddy of mine from Minnesota, Pete Wyden,  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:25):**  start putting out content about elderberry as a profitable business venture.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:30):**  Many of you might remember Pete from previous seasons of the Abundant Edge podcast where  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:34):**  he came out to talk about attracting clients to your permaculture business and unlocking  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:38):**  your potential in regenerative business.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:41):**  And while he still works a lot in permaculture landscape design and business consultation,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:45):**  I invited him back this time to share his knowledge about elderberry as a profitable  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:50):**  and resilient agroforestry business with some really incredible potential.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:54):**  But of course we need to start at the beginning in case you're not familiar with elderberry  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:02:58):**  and its many benefits.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:00):**  I think overarching are that the plants has, the berry is edible, the flowers are also  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:07):**  very useful and are edible.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:10):**  It has vast ecological benefits and also internal benefits for humans.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:17):**  Yeah, it seems like it ticks a lot of boxes, but what got you interested in it?  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:22):**  I think the main reason why I got into elderberry is because of its medicinal benefits and that's  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:28):**  what most people are familiar with.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:31):**  So a lot of peer reviewed studies from the scientific community have been published,  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:36):**  a number of which focus on elderberry fruits ability to help protect healthy cells from  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:44):**  the influenza virus.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:46):**  This has been shown in scientific studies.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:48):**  I wonder what that could be useful for.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:52):**  And also to help people who suffer from hyperglycemia, high blood sugar to protect the eyes, the  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:03:58):**  kidneys and it can be very damaging to the body to have high blood sugar.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:04):**  So elderberry can help moderate that and also elderberry juice has been shown to be inhibitory  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:10):**  and anti-promotional to cancer cells.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:13):**  So it can slow down cancer, it can actually inhibit it from growing, which is mind blowing,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:17):**  right?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:18):**  Well yeah, but what's even more mind blowing to me is that natural remedies like this aren't  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:22):**  more widely used and prescribed.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:25):**  But I won't open that can of worms just now.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:27):**  Let's focus instead on the potential of growing this super plant from a business perspective.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:32):**  In relation to let's say people who have a piece of land and they want to have a profitable  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:38):**  enterprise, the consumer public is increasingly aware of elderberry's benefits.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:45):**  And last year I went on national TV a few different times to talk about that and people  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:51):**  are just so ready for this information.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:04:54):**  And you see it places all types of stores, even Walgreens here in the US, which is like  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:00):**  a corner drug store chain.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:02):**  They have elderberry supplements that people buy and so you don't just have to go to the  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:06):**  health food store to get this stuff.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:08):**  And I love elderberry as a small scale crop because very few people are growing more than  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:16):**  a couple acres of elderberry, say a hectare of elderberry.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:21):**  It hasn't been mechanized.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:23):**  You can't use machinery to harvest it.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:25):**  The fruit is very soft and breaks apart.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:29):**  But that being said, it's also a perennial crop.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:32):**  So let's say somebody who has a small vegetable farm or even just a property that they've  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:38):**  retired on and they want to make some extra income, it's very well within a possibility  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:44):**  to be making between six and $40,000 per acre per year growing elderberry, depending on  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:51):**  if you're selling wholesale or making it into value added products such as juices.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:05:58):**  The management is fairly straightforward for elderberry, but I think there's a lot of oversimplification  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:04):**  that a lot of people tend to get into with growing elderberry as with many other crops  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:10):**  where it's just like, well, if we have high organic matter in our soils, high pH, we should  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:15):**  be good to go.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:17):**  So that's where I come in as a consultant is helping people really understand some of  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:20):**  that nuance on the ground versus that pie in the sky romantic idea that I think a lot  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:27):**  of us have when we first start an operation.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:31):**  For sure.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:32):**  I mean, I know I've fallen victim to over romanticizing my own business ideas in the  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:35):**  past.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:36):**  So let's get a good practical understanding to build realistic expectations on.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:41):**  Tell me some of the essential information that someone interested in growing elderberry  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:45):**  should know about the plant itself.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:47):**  In Europe, a lot of elderberry is actually processed very industrially, at least on the  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:52):**  larger scale.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:54):**  And so it's different here in the US where our primary focus is the medicine.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:06:58):**  It's not also a dye and other things that it's used for in Europe.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:02):**  But Sambucus canadensis is native from Canada down to Texas, and it grows across that whole  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:09):**  range.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:10):**  And so people in Georgia, people in the Pacific Northwest, we do also have Sambucus cerulea,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:18):**  which is blue elderberry, which is native in the Rockies and which I here in Minnesota  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:22):**  in the US I'm going to be trying to grow because it is cold hardy.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:26):**  But Sambucus canadensis, the American black elderberry, has many different varieties that  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:31):**  have been selected from, they're really just cuttings taken from wild plants.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:36):**  And when we're talking about varieties, it's also important to mention that I don't recommend  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:41):**  anyone planting a whole field of one cutting because they're going to be genetically identical.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:45):**  And in permaculture and just holistic gardening and farming, we want to keep that diversity  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:50):**  up.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:51):**  So that's why variety is important.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:52):**  But there are a lot of varieties to choose from.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:54):**  And here in Minnesota, we're at a higher latitude.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:07:57):**  And so we do get earlier frost.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:01):**  And it's important that our elderberry plants are going to actually fruit and ripen fully  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:07):**  so we can harvest them before that frost.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:10):**  So generally, right now, there are four really common varieties grown here.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:15):**  They're Bob Gordon and ranch, and Adams too, and Johns.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:22):**  There's also a variety called Wildwood, which has huge flower heads and also big berry clusters  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:29):**  afterward.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:30):**  That one's grown mostly for flowers in this area.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:32):**  But it's really something that I invite people to experiment with on their own property.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:36):**  They're not terribly expensive to get cuttings.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:39):**  Usually you can get them for like two bucks a cutting.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:41):**  And I recommend just starting out with, let's say, six to eight varieties, seeing what does  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:46):**  well, maybe planting more of a few so that you actually have, let's say, a half acre  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:50):**  to start with.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:51):**  But then you can build out from there, take cuttings from your existing plants, and then  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:08:55):**  just start in that stepwise fashion and get a real sense of, OK, this half acre or this  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:01):**  acre, what's it going to take to double this size or quadruple the size of this operation?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:06):**  Can we do it?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:08):**  What's it going to take financially, energy, labor-wise, infrastructure, et cetera?  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:14):**  I think it's so cool how many trees and woody species that you can propagate like that from  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:18):**  cuttings.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:19):**  It can really be a lot more affordable to get an agroforestry operation or other perennial  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:23):**  crop operation off the ground than a lot of people think.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:26):**  Now, while the planting and propagation might be really simple, let's talk about the maintenance  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:32):**  of elderberry as a crop, because I've seen that maintenance is one of the aspects that  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:36):**  people can often overlook when getting into a venture like this.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:40):**  The maintenance, as far as pruning goes, doesn't really vary related to the climate.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:48):**  Elderberry benefits from going dormant, at least here in, I believe, in Must, even in  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:09:54):**  Texas because they do get frost in a fair number of regions there even.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:00):**  But depending on the variety, elderberry likes to be treated in different ways.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:05):**  For example, if somebody is growing the European black elderberry, that's more of a tree form,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:11):**  as far as I understand.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:12):**  I have the most experience with the American, which is more shrub-like.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:15):**  But the tree form, for example, there's a variety called Marge of the European that  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:21):**  we can grow here, and people prune that differently, more like a tree.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:26):**  As far as the canadensis goes, the American, it depends on whether your variety is determinate  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:35):**  or indeterminate.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:36):**  It's just like tomatoes, where if you have a determinate tomato variety, it's going to  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:40):**  produce one big flush for the most part of fruit, rather than producing fruit, fruit,  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:46):**  fruit, fruit over, say, a couple months until frost or dormancy.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:53):**  If you have a determinate elderberry variety, you actually are going to come in and prune  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:10:57):**  those stems all off right at the ground.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:01):**  That's what's been shown to be...  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:02):**  The University of Missouri has done a lot of research on this.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:05):**  That's what's been shown to be most helpful for determinate varieties, to reset the clock  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:09):**  on all the stems so they flower and fruit at the same time, making it really easy to  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:14):**  come through and harvest all your stuff.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:16):**  We tend to grow determinate varieties here in the higher latitudes because they're more  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:21):**  reliably producing all their fruit at once, and often a little bit earlier than indeterminate  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:27):**  varieties.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:28):**  For example, ranch and Bob Gordon are determinate, indeterminate varieties would be like Wildwood,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:34):**  Adams II, Johns.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:36):**  There are a bunch of others.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:37):**  I believe it's more common to have an indeterminate variety than not.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:41):**  But indeterminate, you treat it a little bit more like, say, a blueberry bush, where you're  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:44):**  pruning out the third year and older canes, although the age range is different for blueberries.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:51):**  But you take the older canes, you take damaged and diseased canes out, and then you're really  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:11:55):**  looking to have those second year canes be the main producers for your crop.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:03):**  All right.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:04):**  Well, now that we have a solid understanding of the maintenance of an elderberry system,  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:08):**  let's explore the harvest and post-harvest aspect, because I know that there's a lot  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:12):**  more products that you can make and sell from elderberry.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:17):**  What most people are selling is the bulk frozen fruit.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:23):**  At least the people that I work with to set up initial elderberry farm plans and get them  
**[0:12:28-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:28):**  going, it's probably the simplest thing to harvest and package and get sold.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:37):**  So people will take the fruit and sanitize it and rinse it and pack it into buckets and  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:42):**  freeze it, get it to whomever is buying it wholesale, like 25-pound buckets.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:48):**  There are a number of farmers in the area here where I am who also harvest the flowers.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:54):**  And actually, on any elderberry plant, you can harvest the bottom third closest to the  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:12:59):**  ground of the flowers and not adversely affect the amount of fruit that you're getting, which  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:04):**  is pretty interesting.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:06):**  So people who are harvesting the flowers, it flowers in June here where I am, and you'll  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:11):**  take those flowers.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:12):**  You can sell them fresh or dried, and it really depends on what your end market is.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:17):**  So if you're making your own tea, you're going to be drying it.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:22):**  But if you're selling it to perhaps somebody who's making elderflower liqueur, they might  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:27):**  want to use the fresh or dried, and it depends on the person's preference.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:31):**  So you really want to know who your market is before you're looking at harvesting these  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:36):**  things.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:37):**  As far as the process for harvesting flowers, it's the same for the most part as the fruit  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:43):**  where you harvest those flowers, you actually de-stem them.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:46):**  And with the flowers, you're just rubbing them over a hardware cloth type of mesh.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:52):**  And so you get rid of that sime, which is the umbrella-like structure that the flowers  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:56):**  are born on.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:13:58):**  So you don't need that.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:00):**  You just get all the flowers off, and they're very, very densely laden with pollen, which  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:05):**  is, I believe, the actual medicinal component of the flower.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:09):**  It's super fragrant, and so I know somebody in this area who sells the dried flowers to  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:15):**  a local tea maker, and they have a really great relationship doing that.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:18):**  And so you can get multiple products in the same season.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:22):**  It's not mutually exclusive flowers and fruit.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:24):**  You can definitely do both.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:27):**  I'm not as familiar with some of the other uses, such as a friend of mine in Missouri  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:32):**  had a really nasty knee injury of some kind, of some kind of wound.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:37):**  And his wife made him a poultice of the elderberry bark, and it just healed him like magic.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:45):**  So it's got some type of healing abilities from the bark.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:49):**  I've heard things with the leaves, too, but I focus on the flowers and fruit.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:52):**  And I do also want to mention that in relation to the saleable products that come off the  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:14:57):**  elderberry plant, the cuttings are a very, very high value product as well, because a  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:03):**  lot of people are looking for cuttings of certain varieties to start their own farm  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:08):**  or even grow in their own backyard.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:11):**  I think I made about, I don't know, $600 last year selling little bundles of five cuttings  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:17):**  out of a cooler off the farm here.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:20):**  And I don't even actually farm elderberry.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:22):**  I live on a blueberry farm.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:23):**  So the potential is really vast, because while I was running the numbers to potentially start  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:29):**  up my own elderberry farm a few months ago, you can make about 16 grand per acre just  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:35):**  on cuttings.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:37):**  And you have to prune anyway every year to make sure your plants stay vigorous and productive.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:43):**  And that's with a determinate variety where you're cutting off all the canes.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:46):**  But between $4,000 and $16,000 per acre per year, not including flowers and fruit, and  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:15:54):**  not even including the potential for and keeping food safety protocols in mind, because there  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:00):**  are some laws about this.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:01):**  But let's say if you were running chickens through a certain time of year and helping  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:05):**  that fertility after you take the fruit off in the fall, there's a lot of great potential.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:12):**  And some people I know in this area, too, who are integrating poultry with these systems  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:17):**  as well in an alley cropping situation.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:19):**  So there's a lot of ways to stack the benefits and really have a very profitable enterprise  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:25):**  on just a couple acres with this plant.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:27):**  That's awesome and really inspiring.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:30):**  It's really one of my favorite parts of all that I've learned about agroforestry and perennial  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:33):**  plant systems.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:34):**  I mean, it's just how many complementary products and enterprises that integrate beautifully  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:39):**  to create whole farm ecosystems that benefit all the different elements.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:44):**  It seems like the configuration potential is limited only by your imagination and the  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:48):**  energy that you can afford to get the projects off the ground.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:51):**  But now, any conversation about elderberry and its medicine would be incomplete without  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:56):**  talking about elderberry syrup.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:16:58):**  And I know we talked about this before, but you don't have a strict recipe that you use  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:02):**  or recommend, right?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:03):**  Yeah, so the reason why I don't have a specific recipe I give people is because it really  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:08):**  depends on personal preference.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:10):**  One, elderberry syrup is pretty much across the board always going to be sweetened with  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:16):**  something.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:17):**  It adds an amount of balance to the flavor.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:20):**  And especially if you're giving it to children, they're going to lap it up if it's sweetened  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:23):**  with something.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:24):**  So some people might use, say, turbinado sugar or maple syrup or local honey, maybe coconut  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:31):**  palm sugar, depending on what's available in your local area, especially, or what your  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:35):**  personal preference and health needs are, et cetera.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:38):**  I personally don't use cane sugar that much.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:42):**  And so generally what I do, and I have a bunch of elderberries and wild grapes in the freezer,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:47):**  I'm going to be making this soon, is I just put it all in a pot together.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:52):**  And what I have found is that to a degree, the more the better in terms of the amount  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:17:59):**  of berries that you can use.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:02):**  So let's say if I'm making a pot of elderberry syrup, let's say I'm using a four quart pot.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:12):**  I'll fill it halfway with elderberries.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:15):**  And so when I harvest the elderberries, if it's just for me, I might not actually de-stem  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:20):**  them off that umbrella-like structure of the sime.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:23):**  I might just freeze them, which makes it really easy to kind of bang around the elderberries  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:28):**  in a bucket or just a large pot to get them off of that stem.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:32):**  So whatever you need to do to get them off, but filling that pot halfway and adding enough  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:38):**  water to cover them, maybe with an inch of water, a couple centimeters of water, and  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:45):**  then just setting that on a low simmer.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:48):**  And I like to simmer things low instead of flaring it up.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:52):**  I just give things a lot of time on a low heat.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:18:55):**  And then as time goes on, those elderberries start to cook down a little bit.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:01):**  You can even add your seasoning spices right away, but ginger and clove and cinnamon are  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:08):**  very common additions.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:09):**  But it's really just thinking about what are some herbs that are also antimicrobial are  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:15):**  going to make a nice kind of solution together that's going to make this magic flavor.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:22):**  But of course, ginger, clove, cinnamon are all very, they balance each other's flavors  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:28):**  really nicely.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:30):**  They're warming herbs.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:32):**  They're antimicrobial.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:34):**  Ginger especially can help with digestion and soothing an upset stomach.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:38):**  So let's say if you're using this as a cold and flu prevention, you know, somebody's feeling  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:44):**  a little upset stomach like a child, you know, having some extra ginger in there, depending  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:48):**  on you can balance things differently.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:51):**  But cooking all those things together, what you're going to do is most people are going  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:19:57):**  to strain those elderberry skins out of there.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:02):**  You could use like a jelly cloth, muslin, a couple layers of muslin cloth to strain  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:09):**  this whole solution to get the elderberry skins and also the seed seeds are tiny, tiny.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:15):**  So if you don't want to get the seeds out, you can just use a larger steel mesh, for  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:20):**  example, but that's going to be strained once you cook it down to a point where you feel  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:27):**  like the flavor's been concentrated enough for you or, you know, that the amount of liquid  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:34):**  has gone down that couple centimeters that you had above the berries, for example, and  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:38):**  you've got that nice solution going.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:41):**  And then finally, I personally add the sweetener at the end, and this is what most people do  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:46):**  if they're trying to make a thicker syrup.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:50):**  And so to make that thick syrup, I see a lot of syrup in stores that's just very liquidy,  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:20:56):**  which is totally fine, but in my mind, syrup is thick.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:02):**  But to make that, for example, the way I do it is I just add a ton of honey.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:07):**  And so the honey is the thickness, but I let the elderberry solution, you know, the juice  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:13):**  with the spices cool off because if you add the honey while it's hot, it's going to liquefy  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:18):**  and it won't give you as much of that thickness, at least not right away.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:23):**  So there are a lot of different ways to do it.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:24):**  There are a lot of different recipes.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:27):**  I do have some books I can link to in the show notes that I recommend that have some  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:33):**  really great recipes as well.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:35):**  Ultimately, I would say the main components are make sure that you have the right types  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:43):**  of herbs that you want in there to add some extra flavor, maybe warming, maybe cooling  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:47):**  feelings, whatever you're looking for, digestive ease and that sweetener, choosing what you  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:54):**  want there.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:21:55):**  And otherwise, it's really done to the taste and consistency that you personally prefer.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:00):**  Yeah, I can attest to that.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:02):**  I made a lot of small batches of elderberry syrup from that big harvest I did when I first  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:07):**  got here and I played around with ginger and cinnamon and cloves and different kinds of  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:11):**  honey.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:12):**  I didn't even try to batch with just spices and no sweetener, which I can confidently  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:17):**  say is an acquired taste.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:20):**  My partner Alba won't go near that batch and I'm pretty sure it's slowly fermented, but  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:24):**  I still take a brave sip now and then.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:27):**  But anyway, we've covered a lot of important aspects about growing elderberry as a business,  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:33):**  but I'd love to hear some of your specific advice for our listeners who are interested  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:36):**  in getting started.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:38):**  Yeah, so the big thing for me is that, and where I really love to help people out with  
**[0:22:45-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:45):**  my consultation here in the Midwest, is that it's about the initial layout and what you're  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:53):**  starting with.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:55):**  Somebody might be starting with something that used to be a cornfield in terms of your  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:22:58):**  land or maybe it's overgrown prairie or maybe it's a thicket of woods, which that has its  
**[0:23:04-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:04):**  own problems, but you know, elderberry is a very, very adaptable plant.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:14):**  And so I don't want to scare people away from growing it because it ultimately, you can  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:19):**  get a crop growing in the weirdest places.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:23):**  I harvest elderberries that grow next to a railroad and it's like super compacted gravel.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:28):**  So you know, it grows in a lot of places, but if you want to develop a reputation as  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:35):**  a go-to source for, let's say, elderberry syrup juices or even bulk frozen fruit, for  
**[0:23:43-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:43):**  example, for your area, I highly recommend getting some in-depth soil tests and really  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:51):**  starting out with a good plan from either an agronomist or a consultant who is very  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:23:58):**  familiar with the elderberry plant, with fruit growing, looking at things beyond just nitrogen,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:05):**  potassium, phosphorus in the soil, because there's a lot of other stuff that's going  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:08):**  to affect nutrient availability and also down the line pest and disease resistance, as well  
**[0:24:14-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:14):**  as the ultimate quality of your fruit, your flowers, and even the, let's say the vitality  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:23):**  of your cuttings and how well they grow for other people.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:27):**  It's amazing to me how much the quality of the soil and the life they're in and the nutrient  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:32):**  availability affects elderberries.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:34):**  But as a general rule to start with, higher organic matter is going to be your friend.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:41):**  A lot of people say elderberry likes wet feet and while it can handle some soil moisture  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:45):**  for sure, it doesn't like standing water for more than say a couple of weeks in the spring  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:51):**  while it's still fairly dormant.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:54):**  So really looking at better drain sites with higher organic matter and a pH between five  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:24:59):**  and a half and six and a half is some initial rules for growing elderberry.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:05):**  Aside from the soil aspect of it, this is a crop that does require irrigation.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:11):**  If you're looking to get really consistent crops, especially of the fruit, but also if  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:16):**  you're planting anything more than a quarter acre and you need to water those cuttings,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:22):**  for example, the first season, otherwise, since they don't really have roots yet, they  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:27):**  could very easily dry out and you could lose 30% or more of your cuttings that you spent  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:32):**  time and money getting in the ground.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:36):**  So I recommend drip tubing irrigation, different types depending on topography and really looking  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:42):**  at what is your water source and do you really want to be out there with a truck or a tractor  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:47):**  and a water tank watering that stuff in the middle of August or do you want to spend,  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:52):**  let's say $500 per acre and just lay it out at the beginning.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:25:58):**  Not only is that solid advice for growing elderberries, it's also good advice for starting  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:03):**  almost any agroforestry project.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:06):**  Given the wide range of areas and climate zones where this incredible medicinal powerhouse  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:09):**  can grow, I hope that this has sparked some ideas in all of you to look into whether or  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:14):**  not growing elderberry could be a good primary enterprise where you live or as a complementary  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:19):**  enterprise with other production systems on your land.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:23):**  Now before we wrap up today, I want to pose a couple of questions that we'll be discussing  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:26):**  further in the Discord server this week.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:29):**  So if you're inspired by the potential and approachability of elderberry farming, but  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:33):**  think that elderberry specifically might not be the right plant for you in your context,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:39):**  what other perennial crop might be a profitable option for you in your space?  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:44):**  And also, are there any plants that you're currently growing that could be more profitable  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:49):**  if you can find a market for their waste products the way that Pete did with the cuttings from  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:53):**  the pruning process with elderberries?  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:26:56):**  I'm always amazed by the potential and adaptability of agroforestry systems and perennial plants  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:27:01):**  to act as either primary or secondary enterprises in a mixed farm setting.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-start-a-profitable-elderberry-farm/#t=0:27:07):**  Now as always, I'll be continuing this conversation with the Regenerative Skills community on

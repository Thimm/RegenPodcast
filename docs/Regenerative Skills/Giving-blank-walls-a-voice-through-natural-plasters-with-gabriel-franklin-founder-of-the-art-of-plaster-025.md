**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:23):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:25):**  My guest today is Gabriel Franklin, master plasterer and the owner of the company The  
**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:31):**  Art of Plaster.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:33):**  Gabriel grew up with a father who was a designer and builder who shared much of his trade with  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:37):**  him from a young age.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:39):**  From the age of 13, Gabriel started on his dad's bucket and clean up crew and has been  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:43):**  working in plastering and finish work ever since.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:46):**  As an artist and nature enthusiast, he has traveled all over the American Northeast and  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:51):**  even as far as Australia with his trade and dedication to giving blank walls a voice with  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:01:56):**  clay, lime and gypsum plasters, saying he is inspired by artistic design and how natural  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:02):**  materials can accentuate one's personal experience within a living space.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:07):**  In this interview, Gabriel explains the difference in performance and characteristics of clay,  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:12):**  lime and gypsum.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:13):**  He goes into detail about the importance of prep work and the variety of additives he  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:17):**  uses to get specific finish effects and add strength to his mixes.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:22):**  We even talk about some tricks of the trade and much more.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:26):**  For those of you who don't already know, earthen plasters and finishes are just about my favorite  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:30):**  thing about natural building and so I was super excited to nerd out with Gabriel about  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:35):**  his craft.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:36):**  So sorry in advance if I get a little giddy at times and end up coming off as a weirdo.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:40):**  I tried my best to play it down and stay calm but hey, it's what it is.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:45):**  I promise I'll be more composed in other episodes.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:48):**  So here's Gabriel.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:49):**  Hey Gabriel, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:52):**  How are you?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:53):**  I'm doing great Oliver, thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:02:56):**  Hey, it's my pleasure and I've got a ton of questions that I'd love to ask you.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:00):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:02):**  Go for it.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:03):**  Alright, so let's start out, let's have you tell me a little bit about yourself and your  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:07):**  background or what is it that's got you interested in an art form that many people don't know  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:13):**  very much about and frankly often times overlook?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:16):**  Well you know, growing up my father was a design builder and I was around a lot of interesting  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:26):**  building styles as a young kid.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:30):**  He had a real eclectic style of construction and design and he started playing around with  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:39):**  plaster finishes when I was just a young kid.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:42):**  I was the bucket cleanup crew for a good while and you know, things just sort of evolved  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:49):**  from there.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:50):**  What kind of construction methods did you really get your hands on early on?  
**[0:03:54-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:03:54):**  So I'd say in my late teens we were doing a lot of new construction but we were using  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:03):**  a lot of reclaimed materials.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:06):**  At the time my dad was buying old barns that had been taken down.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:12):**  We purchased an old mill.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:16):**  He had been importing reclaimed materials from old plantations in New Orleans and down  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:24):**  south and sort of incorporating all these reclaimed materials into some newer buildings  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:30):**  that he was building at the time.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:33):**  I was around that aspect of the construction all the time and then the plastering was kind  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:41):**  of the way that he sort of brought all those elements together.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:45):**  So I've seen an array of this sort of reclaimed style of build with a new age sort of twist  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:04:57):**  to it throughout my youth.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:01):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:02):**  He was a bit ahead of his time before the whole green movement and stuff took over.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:06):**  He's heard that and I've heard that about him more times over.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:09):**  I can imagine.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:11):**  So what kinds of plasters and finishes did you mostly work with while growing up?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:15):**  So growing up I really just worked a lot with gypsum plasters.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:20):**  You know an exterior we did cement stuccos.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:24):**  You know I was kind of practicing sort of with the materials that my father and those  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:32):**  that we worked with had knowledge of and what was readily available to us.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:40):**  So at the time it was primarily and still to this day I still do a lot of gypsum related  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:47):**  plasters but more so the last 10 years I've really really been getting into lime and clay  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:53):**  as well.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:54):**  I have not really been working much at all with cement.  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:58):**  Well that's good.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:05:59):**  Can you explain to our listeners before we get too deep into any of those a little about  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:03):**  the differences between clay, lime and gypsum plasters?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:08):**  Well gypsum is a milled material and the gypsum plasters that we've been using are all sort  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:16):**  of pre-milled bagged materials that you know you'd add water to and then do your coating  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:24):**  process interior.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:29):**  Lime has been a real eye-opener for me over the last several years because of its life  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:36):**  cycle and its ability to be recycled.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:40):**  And it's just it's aspects of a material that really seem to work in a building environment.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:50):**  And what about clay?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:53):**  And clay.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:06:54):**  So clay just being the most readily available recyclable plaster material known to existence.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:07):**  And what's so interesting too about it Oliver is I feel like I've you know in a lot of ways  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:12):**  as a tradesman I've kind of learned about these things backwards.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:17):**  You know I feel like I feel like all of us should have been more educated in really what  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:24):**  clay can be used for in our building practices.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:29):**  But really there's you know until until a lot more of the natural you know the natural  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:34):**  building boom that's been happening the education on clay and lime for that matter has you know  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:40):**  has really not been easily accessible to those in the building community.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:47):**  Yeah that's interesting because my path has been almost exactly the opposite.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:51):**  I worked a lot in industrial construction for quite a few years but when I started to  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:07:56):**  take it seriously I made the jump right to an apprenticeship in natural building.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:00):**  And so while I had done some gypsum plastering mostly with drywall and such when I actually  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:07):**  started to learn about it I started with clay and then lime and now I hardly ever use just  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:12):**  gypsum plasters especially in applications for natural buildings.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:17):**  And I would imagine most people are most familiar with gypsum plasters in interiors and with  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:22):**  modern drywall.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:24):**  Lime has been one of the most historic plasters along with clay and people are probably most  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:30):**  familiar with that in say half-timbered homes in Europe and lime renders on historical buildings  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:37):**  because it isn't often used conventionally anymore as an exterior finish.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:42):**  It's usually replaced by cement.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:45):**  But I mean clay buildings especially from the applications that I've seen in Africa  
**[0:08:50-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:50):**  in the Middle East and also here in Central and South America are quite I guess common  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:08:58):**  especially in small villages like where I live now where a large portion of the homes  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:05):**  and even a few municipal buildings are entirely made of adobe but you also do see a lot of  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:12):**  lime renders on the exteriors of these as well.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:16):**  That's really great.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:17):**  You know it's in the area that I'm in you know there's a lot of old historic buildings  
**[0:09:22-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:22):**  and a lot of say the old stone homes you know at the time that those homes were built they  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:30):**  were using materials that were readily available.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:35):**  There was creek sands you know river sands the Delaware River runs through our valley  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:40):**  and there were lots of lime kilns in the area where they were you know they're making their  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:45):**  lime so when you know they had stacked the stone the mortar was all very soft and there  
**[0:09:50-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:09:50):**  was you know more lime render on the exterior of these old homes and a lot of repairs over  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:00):**  the years the last hundred years have been made with concrete and we've been seeing the  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:05):**  damages that that's actually been having on these old historic structures so with that  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:11):**  you know there's been a real revitalization and in the education of lime that I've been  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:17):**  really excited about.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:18):**  Yeah I've watched that a lot too especially from my work in the southwest of the United  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:22):**  States around especially New Mexico a lot of those buildings had been traditionally  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:26):**  plastered with clay and usually it was around like the 50s and 60s when people came in and  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:34):**  tried to cement stucco the exteriors 10 or 20 years later down the line they figured  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:39):**  out that it was actually eroding out the wall structure on the inside due to water getting  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:44):**  in through cracks and major major renovations have had to be done on these historic missions  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:50):**  and churches in order to replace them and reinvigorate the tradition of putting on those  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:10:57):**  clay passes in order to preserve the integrity of these historic buildings.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:04):**  And like you were saying depending on where you are historic buildings were done differently  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:09):**  and finished differently based on the materials at hand like you said you've got a lot of  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:15):**  sand in the river basin where you are and lime kilns were common back then and the dissimilar  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:22):**  properties of having cement which is extremely rigid and lime being quite a bit more malleable  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:29):**  has served to degrade these historic buildings and people are kind of just catching up that  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:34):**  you know one doesn't replace the other.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:38):**  So let's switch gears a little bit here.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:41):**  I want to talk about the different properties and performances of each of these types of  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:45):**  plasters especially in the case of natural buildings.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:49):**  What types of plasters do you recommend for durability and weather protection in an outdoor  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:53):**  application?  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:11:54):**  Well in all honesty I think you know to answer that question it really depends on where you  
**[0:12:00-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:00):**  are and with that too the really the design of the building that you're looking to protect  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:08):**  as I've been learning through you know the couple of straw bale houses that I've been  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:12):**  a part of the last couple of years here.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:16):**  You know I think a lot of there's been a lot of talk about using lime renders on newer  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:25):**  construction kind of where I'm at on the you know in the east coast of the United States  
**[0:12:29-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:29):**  here and a lot of a lot of it has to has to do with how the buildings design like do you  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:37):**  have the roof line kind of shedding the water away from the building so that you know it's  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:43):**  not it's not getting repeatedly damaged by heavy weather wet weather.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:49):**  We have a lot of varying types of weather conditions that we see here in Pennsylvania.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:12:55):**  Hot you know very hot in the summer very cold in the winter and really rainy come spring  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:00):**  and fall.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:02):**  So you know so for our area I wouldn't I mean and I'm as I've said in my my education through  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:11):**  plaster renders you know I've been learning more and more about lime and clay and what  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:18):**  I'm seeing now is in time I definitely am going to try a couple projects on my own property  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:24):**  where I do some clay render on the exterior of some outbuildings but it's not I'd say  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:31):**  around in our area clay might not be exactly what I would recommend as an exterior finish  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:36):**  to a home but but lime is certainly is certainly a wise choice.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:43):**  And tell me about some of the differences in performance as an outdoor render between  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:47):**  lime and clay.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:48):**  So the lime with its it's more open structure you know you're talking about how cement is  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:53):**  very rigid and lime is more open it's more flexible it has more of a flexibility and  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:13:59):**  a breathability to it.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:01):**  So whereas you know with say a cement render you know the water if it finds a way through  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:08):**  a crack or something through the cement mortar itself it's so much more difficult for them  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:14):**  the moisture to actually become expelled from the surface of the render whereas the lime  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:20):**  just has such a beautiful property where it literally is able to have this relationship  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:26):**  with moisture where it may absorb it but then be expelling it so much more readily.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:32):**  I'm going to answer your question.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:36):**  Yeah for sure.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:38):**  And what are some of the reasons why the clay would break down in the climate that you just  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:42):**  described and maybe wouldn't be ideal for exterior applications there?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:47):**  So due to the you know due to the driving winds and such the clay is going to absorb  
**[0:14:53-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:14:53):**  the moisture and expel the moisture as well as it dries but it would certainly see it  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:01):**  be more susceptible to erosion but I feel like in some cases that could be a sought  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:08):**  after finish as well depending on the structure that you're looking to to render.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:14):**  For sure.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:15):**  I mean in my experience what I've found mostly is that different additives and even different  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:22):**  types of fiber can definitely change the way that clay either weathers or sometimes even  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:28):**  expels moisture like if you have a lot of fiber in there.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:31):**  Oftentimes the final finish will wear down to the point where the fibers are exposed  
**[0:15:36-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:36):**  and then the fiber almost works like a layer of thatch and will kick off moisture almost  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:47):**  like having sort of a hairy or a thatched exterior.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:50):**  That's really great.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:52):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:54):**  It's really especially with clay there's a ton of room for experimentation at least in  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:15:59):**  my experience.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:01):**  I'm seeing that fully.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:03):**  You know every day that we're you know the current project I'm on in Maryland right now  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:09):**  you know it's been it's all straw bale construction and we've been doing all the site clay subsoil  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:16):**  for all of our building codes.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:18):**  So for our first first clay coat interior and then our following clay coats for all  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:23):**  our sculpting coats and the clay and sand and straw mixtures that we're making up.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:30):**  But it's been really it's been really really empowering to just see that we're just taking  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:34):**  the clay subsoil from the property and you know we're basically adjusting the consistency  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:41):**  and the sand and straw to do different things.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:45):**  You know it's like the same three items that we're mixing together and depending on the  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:50):**  consistency or how much straw it's like what you can actually do with that has been really  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:55):**  empowering in a lot of ways.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:16:56):**  It's like it's like you don't need you don't need much really.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:01):**  Well I'm glad you brought that up because that segues perfectly into my next question  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:06):**  because I imagine now at least at this point in your career you probably make and mix quite  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:10):**  a few of your own plasters that you use.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:13):**  So how do you go about testing and selecting the materials that you have available for  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:17):**  the work or the requirements of the finished look.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:22):**  So basically when we're digging into the clay site soil on the property you know there's  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:30):**  a series of tests that you can do pretty much right there on hand just by you know taking  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:35):**  up some of the clay subsoil adding some water to it and just seeing how it acts you know  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:41):**  how sticky it is how gritty it is.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:44):**  There's also the shake test where you're able to you know put a portion of the clay subsoil  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:49):**  into a glass jar and you fill it with water and tighten up the lid and shake it very tight  
**[0:17:55-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:17:55):**  and then you can actually see the you know the sands separate from the clay and you can  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:04):**  actually calculate a percentage of clay to sand that might be in your subsoil.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:11):**  So with that you can sort of put together like you know a starting point for where your  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:17):**  mix may need to get adjusted whether it would need more clay from a different area a different  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:24):**  source or if you need to be adding more sand to it in order to get the right consistency  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:28):**  for plaster.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:30):**  But really what I've found even after reading all about it and talking with people all about  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:37):**  it you know it really came down to actually just doing it a lot and constantly feeling  
**[0:18:43-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:43):**  it and ultimately you know the recipes they always they're always getting tweaked one  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:51):**  way or the other.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:52):**  Oh yeah all the time.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:18:54):**  It's so much about a feel you know when you really start to understand how the material  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:00):**  is working.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:01):**  Absolutely that's where the art really comes in I've found.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:04):**  For sure.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:05):**  It's artful there but it's also you know it's also very basic and it's it's like it's almost  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:13):**  it can be feel like very challenging as a basic information and I feel like you know  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:18):**  for those that might not know a lot about it or understand it completely I think really  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:22):**  it's just about experimenting with it you know just picking up some of that that dirt  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:28):**  and seeing what you do with it and seeing how it reacts because it you know that's been  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:35):**  really fun for me.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:37):**  Well you know I've been I've been doing all these you know man-milled plasters for years  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:42):**  and kind of like just getting back down to the roots really just down to the dirt to  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:47):**  the earth itself and really literally like seeing how to make the earth malleable to  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:54):**  build with it and that's been it's been really an empowering experience.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:19:59):**  Yeah absolutely I found the same.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:01):**  Now let's talk a little bit about interior since we covered exteriors.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:04):**  Comparing clay, lime and gypsum which ones have certain desired properties and performance  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:11):**  for different interior finishes and let's say you know high moisture environments like  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:16):**  say a kitchen or a bathroom which would you choose for that and in other applications  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:21):**  based on your experience.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:23):**  I've used all three in every environment interior so I've used you know clay, lime and gypsum  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:32):**  in kitchen, bathroom, living room you know all living space environments so I've had  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:38):**  the benefit to kind of see the difference of how they act and really again with clay  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:46):**  what I'm really falling in love with is the aspects of how it can help regulate the humidity  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:52):**  within a space so as far as the bathroom is concerned you know I just feel like the way  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:20:58):**  that clay will actually you know the way that it absorbs moisture in a space it kind of  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:04):**  works it works with the moisture that's happening within a space and you know that's something  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:11):**  that I mean over the last couple years that I've been I've been working more with clay  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:15):**  plasters it's really been exciting to see that that as an aspect of a clay of a render  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:21):**  of an interior render whereas you know gypsum they go up they set very fast they're very  
**[0:21:28-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:28):**  hard they're very durable and you can achieve you know a variety of very high polished to  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:38):**  very textured finishes decorative finishes you know you can carry on continuation of  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:46):**  waxes and glazes and such to get some really interesting interesting looks but it doesn't  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:51):**  have the same permeability that you would get from clay or a lime render where you know  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:21:56):**  the lime and the clay they're both of those materials have a more breathability a breathable  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:03):**  aspect which is very much appealing.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:05):**  Yeah for sure now let's actually take a couple of steps back because this you know having  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:12):**  prepped and plastered and finished quite a number of walls oftentimes what people forget  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:17):**  is the preparation work making sure that the walls that you're putting your finish on is  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:22):**  prepped correctly to take whatever the finish will be can you tell me a little bit about  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:27):**  the different requirements that you usually find between plastering say straw bale walls  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:31):**  cob walls and maybe even conventional laff and even drywall.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:38):**  So that can't even that can't be stressed any more strongly if I have any like whenever  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:46):**  anyone is ever asking me about you know the finished render well first of all I'm always  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:51):**  like well it's a really it's a glamorous lifestyle I mean you see these pictures of these finished  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:55):**  spaces and you're like wow that's so beautiful like you know it's just sounds amazing you  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:22:59):**  know like but what it takes to actually get that plaster there you know the prep and the  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:06):**  processing of your materials it's it is it's quite an undertaking and it's also you know  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:12):**  it's really important that it's done right because your finished plaster is only as strong  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:18):**  as your substrate so if your wall system you know is not adequately prepared prior to the  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:25):**  to the actual finish taking place you know there's a good chance that your walnut might  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:29):**  not last very long.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:33):**  Actually I'm glad you stressed that I completely agree so can you walk us through some of the  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:39):**  the main steps to get to that point that the final finish can really shine and you know  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:44):**  that it's on a sturdy base.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:47):**  So I mean it depends on what we're working off of so I could use the straw bale for example  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:23:56):**  here since that's what I'm currently doing you know with the straw bale it's all about  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:02):**  that the straw bales wall system itself being stacked properly like the walls should be  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:09):**  stacked as as tightly as they can be voids packed with loose straw as as as tightly as  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:16):**  they can be the wall trimmed you know as beautifully as can be the more time you spend shaping  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:23):**  and trimming out your straw bale wall before you start putting up clay the easier your  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:28):**  process of clay plaster is going to go and that all depends on to what level of finish  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:35):**  you're actually looking for at the very end you know if you want perfectly straight walls  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:39):**  or if you want curves and rolls and whatnot.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:45):**  And then hydration so as your you know as your coats go on your clay coats go on making  
**[0:24:50-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:50):**  sure that you're adequately hydrated before proceeding with your following coat you know  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:24:59):**  with my gypsum plasters you know over top of drywall and even in clay for that for that  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:05):**  matter we've been doing some clay over top of sheetrock as well in the project that I'm  
**[0:25:09-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:09):**  currently on you know gypsum I use a lot of bonding agent so I use like a like an adhesive  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:19):**  that I'll add sand to so basically it helps to give a bond to say a previously painted  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:26):**  wall or but the problem whenever you're working with any sort of bonding agent or a sanded  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:33):**  primer you know it doesn't have the same relation with the way that it acts with the moisture  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:39):**  within the coat that you're applying so you know right now like I'm you know in any given  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:45):**  room that I'm currently plastering the majority of the room will be straw bale all the exterior  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:50):**  walls of that room will be straw bale but then the interior walls are sheetrock and  
**[0:25:55-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:25:55):**  I have to even coordinate my plastering accordingly because you know the sheetrock the clay finishes  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:03):**  it will take so much longer to tack up and to start to dry whereas over top of the straw  
**[0:26:09-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:09):**  bale substrate the how it basically absorbs the moisture allows the plaster to just set  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:18):**  a lot to dry a lot faster and allows you to work the wall in different speeds so with  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:25):**  the clay in the in the property that we're actually doing now on over the sheetrock we've  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:29):**  used we've pre-taped you know used a mesh tape over top of the sheetrock everything's  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:35):**  been been skimmed in with gypsum and kind of given the sheetrock somewhat of a flat  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:43):**  finish then there's been a sanded primer that's been added rolled over top of the sheetrock  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:50):**  prior to to the clay plaster application but we're doing all of our clay coats and just  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:26:55):**  a single coat so we're putting up probably 3 16th of an inch of a finished clay surface  
**[0:27:02-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:02):**  directly over top of a sanded primer on sheetrock I have to say every time I'm doing a room  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:11):**  I just love working over the straw bale because the relation relationship that it has with  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:17):**  how it pulls and whispered it just I feel like it gives you a lot more freedom with  
**[0:27:23-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:23):**  how you finish the wall whereas with the with the sheetrock it seems to just be more of  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:32):**  you're still waiting for the right time to like come back and work the material but it's  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:38):**  just it's very different experience and I really have been enjoying working over top  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:42):**  of the straw bale it's just a beautiful substrate fantastic that's an experience I've got to  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:48):**  try for myself I haven't worked nearly enough with straw bales yet though I have done quite  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:52):**  a bit of clay straw slip and I can imagine that making those transitions between dissimilar  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:27:58):**  materials is quite a yeah quite a challenge and takes quite a bit of finesse to get it  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:04):**  so that it doesn't look like underneath their different materials that's really cool yeah  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:08):**  it's definitely it's it's been a challenge for sure but it's been it's been a kind of  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:13):**  a fun one to navigate you know like on a on a day that I'll be finishing a room that has  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:17):**  both substrates straw bale and sheetrock you know generally I'll I've been plastering the  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:24):**  straw bale first thing in the morning and working those you know as the walls dry doing  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:31):**  my my compressions and kind of pulling you know pulling a little cream to the surface  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:35):**  and getting the wall finished right to where I want it and then the walk is done and I  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:41):**  can kind of detail it and then maybe around two o'clock in the afternoon I'll do the sheetrock  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:46):**  walls so by the time I'm done working at five o'clock I can basically take out the wave  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:52):**  and start to compress the sheetrock but it's not ready to finish and I've been able to  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:28:57):**  come back the following morning come in at seven o'clock and then sort of lightly hydrate  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:02):**  the wall and then finish the wall so it's been an interesting rhythm to kind of find  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:07):**  like how to navigate a room but it's been a good it's been a good challenge challenge  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:12):**  for sure.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:13):**  I can imagine that sounds like a lot of fun now one major aspect that is often overlooked  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:18):**  by plaster and finishing books I've found is ceilings.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:22):**  Could you tell us a bit about the process of prepping a ceiling and what types of plaster  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:26):**  mixes and techniques should be considered for them?  
**[0:29:31-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:31):**  So ceilings I've been doing a lot a lot more so gypsum ceiling and it and it I have to  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:40):**  say that it's you know it so far everything's been over sheetrock right so all the ceilings  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:46):**  in this new construction build I'm doing or when I'm coming into an older home that's  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:50):**  already been painted you know that pretty much what I end up doing is putting on first  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:29:55):**  I make sure that the ceiling is sound always make sure that there's no part of the ceiling  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:01):**  that looks like it has any sort of regular water damage or that it's stable you know  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:07):**  making sure that it's stable if it's been painted making sure that you know paint isn't  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:12):**  isn't peeling or buckling off because that's usually an indication that there's something  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:16):**  water related happening above it and any of that any issues with that always need to be  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:23):**  addressed before you start putting your finished plasters on anything.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:29):**  So and then so for my gypsum I would always do a bonding agent you know sanded bonding  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:35):**  agent and then proceeding with you know with a two coat finish.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:41):**  I have not done any clay ceilings but I'd have to say I feel like it's really the same  
**[0:30:49-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:49):**  sort of scenario you're making sure that your that your your substrate is sound and you  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:30:58):**  know follow with with the sanded primer mix and then doing doing clay coats over top of  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:05):**  that.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:06):**  I mean I'm looking forward to the opportunity to actually put some up.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:08):**  I've been doing some gypsum base coat in some areas so there's been some of the sheet rock  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:13):**  there's some inside curved walls that were sheet rock but it's not a perfect curve so  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:19):**  there's a lot of areas to fill out and to kind of give it the proper shape has like  
**[0:31:24-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:24):**  more harder angles and I've been using gypsum to basically fill those voids that are a lot  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:33):**  deeper over sheet rock because I you know I've been I've been trying to find limitations  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:38):**  of the different materials and where the gypsum is having like a like a chemical bond it's  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:44):**  adhering to the to the bonding agent and and it's holding onto the wall very strong in  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:50):**  that manner.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:51):**  You know I'm I'm still have yet to practice you know experiment to see how much clay you  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:31:58):**  could use and build off of sheet rock because in theory the fact that clay is basically  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:05):**  it's sticking and and through hydration right but if there's enough weight you know I feel  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:12):**  like there's also like a sheer value where the plaster might want to just separate from  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:17):**  the surface of the sheet rock and that's something I'm yeah that's a risk yeah I'm still looking  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:22):**  looking at experimenting that's that's what I've been I've been basically like doing some  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:27):**  of my preliminary base coating with gypsum in areas where I need to like create shapes  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:31):**  over top of sheet rock and then finishing with a clay coat because the clay coat will  
**[0:32:36-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:36):**  then has a really nice substrate where the that gypsum substrate is actually allowing  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:44):**  there to be a good relationship with the moisture as far as you know finishing your your clay  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:49):**  coat.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:52):**  Also ceilings you know you know it's it's the same the same protocol that I would fall  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:32:57):**  follow for finishing finishing your walls.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:03):**  Nice now let's talk for a minute now about additives specifically could you explain a  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:08):**  little about what types of ingredients you like to add to different mixes to increase  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:12):**  strength and durability reduce powdering and add different aesthetic effects.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:17):**  So what I've been using with our clay renders is I've been using like a starch paste like  
**[0:33:27-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:27):**  a wheat paste basically to help help kind of make it somewhat stronger you know I found  
**[0:33:35-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:35):**  when I was our finished coats are all we're using bagged bagged clay the reason and that's  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:44):**  not all the walls some of the some of the walls will actually have the finish clay plaster  
**[0:33:49-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:49):**  will be the site clay subsoil but the thing with the clay the site clay subsoil is it  
**[0:33:56-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:33:56):**  tends to be darker in color and after you've been rendering all your interior walls with  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:05):**  the clay subsoil of a darker color a lot of the times by the end of the job everybody  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:08):**  wants to see something light light light and bright.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:14):**  So I've been using bagged potters clay and you know formulating mixes using some sort  
**[0:34:21-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:21):**  of starch paste to basically help make it more workable it has better adhesion and kind  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:30):**  of just makes it a bit stronger as well.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:33):**  Lime renders I tend to use you know some sort of fiber a lot with my exterior interior a  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:42):**  lot of historical restoration work interior you know I'm actually still adding animal  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:47):**  hair just so that I'm giving the lime render some more tensile strength and sometimes with  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:34:55):**  gypsum gypsum is kind of it's you know the milled bag material it's like ready to go  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:01):**  so it's like I never really add much to that to get the you know get the effects that I'm  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:08):**  looking for.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:10):**  Yeah that's usually ready to go out of the bag.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:13):**  Ready to go but I have to say it's really fun to get all sciencey on it.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:19):**  I agree.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:21):**  And start like saying well what if I had a little bit of this and what if I had a little  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:24):**  bit of that you know and that that has actually been I've been having a lot of fun sort of  
**[0:35:30-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:30):**  you know putting on an apron and being like all right let's bake some paste and you know.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:38):**  Have you experimented at all with different additives to help to slow down the dry time  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:42):**  of lime plasters in order to help it to set better?  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:48):**  Like pozzolan is over here talking about or.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:51):**  Yeah either pozzolanic additives or I've heard of people putting oils and even dissolved  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:35:57):**  salt that will hold the moisture for longer have you had any experience with those?  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:01):**  I have not I have not experimented.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:04):**  All right well we'll have to keep in touch and see if either of us find out some cool  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:07):**  information about that.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:09):**  That's on my radar though.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:11):**  All right.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:13):**  So let's let's switch gears one more time here and talk about different troweling techniques  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:18):**  and the ways of achieving different finishes and effects through the way that you apply  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:22):**  the mixture.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:23):**  Could you explain a little about compression techniques and how things like buffing and  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:27):**  polishing can not only change the appearance but also the texture and the performance of  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:31):**  a finish.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:34):**  So I think it's it's really important to have a good handle on your tools.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:39):**  So you're you're a hawk and trowel.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:42):**  That's that's how you're applying or if you've already applied the material and you're coming  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:46):**  back to burnish depending on what material it is you're using and what direction you're  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:51):**  going I think it's for your finish.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:36:54):**  One of the most important things to consider is how to keep a low stress impact the lowest  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:00):**  stress impact on your body because ultimately you're just you're physically working these  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:04):**  walls in order to accomplish a finish.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:07):**  And if you're going to be doing it in a large amount it's definitely important to do it  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:13):**  well so that you're kind of taking care of your body while you're doing it because it  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:17):**  certainly can be can be taxing.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:19):**  So you always want to work in front of you know work in front of you.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:23):**  You don't want to be working too far out of your your your center range I guess right.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:31):**  So I'm not you know I'm not reaching six feet over to my right to kind of compress plaster.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:37):**  I'd be standing right behind my my arm in my hand.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:42):**  And I'm also depending on the type of trowel that you're using you may hold it slightly  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:49):**  different but generally I'm always trying to concentrate my pressure on the spine of  
**[0:37:56-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:37:56):**  my trowel and with that I'm basically trying to figure out the best way to explain it.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:38:05):**  But so when you're holding your trowel and say you're you're compressing the material  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:38:11):**  whether it's it's lime clay or gypsum for that matter once it's at the right point for  
**[0:38:17-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:38:17):**  compression I'm standing behind my trowel and with a repetitive motion I'm generating  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:38:25):**  a force down the spine of my trowel but I'm allowing variations of pressure to be released  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:38:31):**  through the edge of the tool that's actually tracking along the surface.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:38:36):**  So my my compression on the spine of the trowel is consistent but what I actually allow to  
**[0:38:44-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:38:44):**  come off of the edge of the tool whether it's a steel blade or or a plastic blade or stainless  
**[0:38:51-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:38:51):**  steel or carbon steel or wood float sometimes for exterior you know the sort of the release  
**[0:39:02-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:02):**  can fluctuate and it's it's it's much easier demonstrated than discussed how to formulate  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:13):**  some some better ways to explain it because it is really important you know I think I  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:19):**  wear I wear wrist protection regularly as more of a proactive thing because you know  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:26):**  you're you're really working not only your shoulder but your wrists and your elbow you  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:32):**  know and and it's important to know that you're you're using all of them in a manner that's  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:38):**  you know not putting too much stress on your body because it's strenuous work.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:44):**  Yeah for sure that's that's really good advice and I I tell that to all my students as well  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:50):**  but it often ends up being one of these like do as I say not as I do as I'm reaching across  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:55):**  a ladder to reach a little spot in the by a window yeah.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:39:58):**  Oh yeah yeah you know there are times where you need to just you need to pull out that  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:03):**  you know pull out that little bit power that you've been saving to make out that that long  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:07):**  reach that long reach stretch.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:10):**  Yeah it's true.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:12):**  So man where do we go from here?  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:15):**  What resources do you recommend to my listeners who are keen about learning more about natural  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:20):**  plasters and finishes?  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:21):**  Do you know of any apprenticeships or courses that teach the skills that we talked about  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:26):**  so they can actually kind of see firsthand a lot of the things that we've talked about  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:30):**  which often don't translate very well just you know audibly.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:35):**  Another thing so for me what I would recommend is you know getting active on social media  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:44):**  for the sake of finding finding people locally you know so like in your area if it's in your  
**[0:40:51-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:51):**  state your country like where there are people that are hosting workshops on on these aspects  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:40:59):**  of you know applying render and you know I feel like I didn't really there is a point  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:05):**  in my my life where I just thought that I was the last plaster alive.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:10):**  I didn't realize that there is this whole network community all throughout the world  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:15):**  that you know I'm just continuous you know continuing to meet more and more individuals  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:20):**  and it's just that's been that's been a really really wonderful part of this whole process  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:25):**  as well just seeing that there's there's more of us out there that are you know as enthusiastic  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:31):**  about it and we're not alone.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:35):**  Yeah it's pretty reassuring isn't it?  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:39):**  I always worry that I get way too nerdy and way too geeky about this type of stuff and  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:42):**  I get really excited when I can talk to someone like you and like dive down these rabbit holes  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:46):**  of these little minute questions.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:51):**  But you know with that being said though you know I've definitely I've spent a lot of time  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:41:56):**  just trying to network online seeing what's what's near me and with that you know I've  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:02):**  taken I've taken some workshops of my own.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:06):**  You know I took a workshop at the American College of the Building Arts and is in it's  
**[0:42:17-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:17):**  down south south of Virginia.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:19):**  I'll put a link to it in the podcast.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:23):**  It's in South Carolina but it was with Patrick Webb and I did a workshop.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:29):**  He had this master plaster from Italy Franco Saladino come into a weekend workshop and  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:36):**  that was like this.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:37):**  It was a real just like eye opener for me just kind of meeting like a real traditional  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:43):**  Italian plaster and then again finding out about this workshop and just being amongst  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:49):**  other people you know other tradesmen in the community or those looking to learn some new  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:42:55):**  techniques that and I met guys all around the United that were from all around the United  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:00):**  States and that kind of like just started me like on the hunt a bit more for these workshop  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:06):**  opportunities because with that you know I've continued to take workshops and just continue  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:12):**  to meet great people that are interested and excited about it and also just learning new  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:17):**  things from so many different people.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:21):**  Really trying to take in what everybody has to say you know and then just formulating  
**[0:43:24-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:24):**  what works best for me in the process of it but it's all been about networking just really  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:32):**  trying to find where those resources might be available.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:36):**  Yeah absolutely I found that too.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:38):**  Once you do take the time to look for it there's a fantastic community all around the world  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:43):**  of people who really put their passion into this.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:46):**  Agreed.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:47):**  Yeah completely.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:49):**  I took a workshop with the woman who's designed the building I'm working on now I took a workshop  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:43:55):**  with Seiki Koko a couple years ago now and that was that was a big eye opener for me  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:02):**  you know she had a lot of a great variety of people that were attending the workshop  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:07):**  you know some were in the trades and a lot just wanted to get their hands in mud and  
**[0:44:12-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:12):**  it was really really awesome to just see that environment in itself too.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:19):**  So it's a lot of fun to just go and attend these workshops if you just want to like try  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:24):**  something different but you can also learn a great deal from them as well.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:28):**  Absolutely yes Seiki Koko is fantastic and I did a podcast interview with her which I'll  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:33):**  link to in the show notes as well.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:35):**  But hey before I let you go here what is the best way to find out more about your work  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:38):**  and to see some of the gorgeous examples of the finishes you've done.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:42):**  Well you know I do a regular update on all my current projects on Instagram.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:44:49):**  I post a lot of photographs of all the cool stuff that we're doing.

**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:14):**  a follow up sometime I've got tons more questions just after the great answers that you gave  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:20):**  to what I had already.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:23):**  Absolutely Albert no we'll definitely reconnect my friend nice to meet you.

**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:32):**  All right sounds great.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:35):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:38):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics Shad  
**[0:45:43-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:43):**  Goodsy.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:44):**  Hey buddy what's new?  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:45):**  Oh man so much is happening.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:48):**  First off though I just want to say thanks for having me man I really love your podcast  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:52):**  and I actually had a great time doing that interview back in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:45:57):**  Anyway probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:02):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:03):**  As you know we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:08):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:11):**  In particular though the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:17):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:46:22-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:22):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:24):**  Like honestly you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:30):**  Yeah that's for sure.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:31):**  Life changing.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:32):**  But like I said what I'm most excited about is that now thanks to our collaboration we're  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:37):**  going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one of our  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:42):**  intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:45):**  Literally this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I know of available  
**[0:46:51-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:51):**  anywhere.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:52):**  Basically with these two courses alone I think that someone should have everything they need  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:46:57):**  to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:02):**  That's what I'm excited about man.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:04):**  But yeah what about you?  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:05):**  What's going on?  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:06):**  Man well you know already that me and the abundant edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:10):**  season as well.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:11):**  I mean starting in November we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:16):**  site which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:19):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:47:25-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:25):**  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:28):**  I mean the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:33):**  methods for years and years to come and we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:38):**  to people who want to learn for themselves about how to build with natural materials  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:42):**  and set up their own farms.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:45):**  Heck yeah!  
**[0:47:46-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:46):**  That sounds amazing man.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:48):**  And honestly this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things too.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:52):**  I mean this little town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala like  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:57):**  right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:47:58):**  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:01):**  On top of that you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich and alive  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:07):**  and probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:13):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:17):**  I mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house you've got loads of things going  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:22):**  on.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:23):**  We've got the projects that we've already talked about but you also have yoga retreat  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:26):**  centers.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:27):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:30):**  You have Love Probiotics.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:31):**  You've got Fungi Academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:37):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:40):**  Yeah man it really does and I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects  
**[0:48:44-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:44):**  but we've got to make sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:47):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:48):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:51):**  I mean all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:48:56):**  the tuition so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:49:00):**  That's a great idea because I mean people can still take just one course if that's what  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:49:04):**  they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks but this will actually make the  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-gabriel-franklin/#t=0:49:08):**  two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people.

**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:05:42):**  well I look at it as that period before Bill Mollison called me one day, which I think  
**[0:05:49-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:05:49):**  was about 99 or something like that, 1999, and said something like, it's about time you,  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:05:57):**  I often use his voice, I go, it's about time you started to teach.

**[0:06:15-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:06:15):**  And he, yeah, we smoked cigarettes together and hung out when he was, and he was not married  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:06:24):**  at that time as well.

**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:06:34):**  he moved down to Tasmania.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:06:35):**  So he sold his farm or moved from his farm up north in Northern New South Wales, went  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:06:40):**  down there and approached me to do that.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:06:44):**  And my immediate reaction to that was, okay, what's the money?  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:06:50):**  Because at that time, I was contracting.

**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:03):**  That was all I really considered.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:05):**  And I think that, well, Bill obviously saw that I could put two words together, which  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:12):**  is the first, I suppose, the first cab off the rank as far as teaching is concerned.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:18):**  You've got to be able to communicate.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:21):**  And in my discussions with him around what I was doing with clients, I said this to someone  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:29):**  recently when they asked me, oh, you had what sort of training courses do you do to become  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:33):**  a teacher?  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:34):**  I said, well, I'll use my own experience here.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:37):**  Part of that is actually navigating a conversation with people.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:43):**  And for me, at least that was doing that with literally hundreds of clients was really a  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:53):**  good foundation for that because you have to take those people on a journey.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:07:57):**  I mean, a lot of teaching is storytelling and having people, I suppose, believe what  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:03):**  you're telling them.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:04):**  There's a bit of salesmanship, I suppose.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:09):**  So that consulting space really helped with that.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:13):**  The other part to that is, which is what a precursor to that with Bill was that he asked  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:19):**  me to write a book for him as he was a publisher at that time still to Togari Publications,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:25):**  I think.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:27):**  But yeah, Togari.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:30):**  And that was around my process because every time he caught up with me, he was really stoked  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:35):**  about my process.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:36):**  He loved the fact that I was handling all these jobs and getting all this work done.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:41):**  There's a really cool interview that he did for a US magazine.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:45):**  I can't remember the other interviewer now, but he was bragging that one of his people,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:53):**  because that's how people do it.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:57):**  And he was exaggerating wildly.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:08:59):**  It was pretty, it was almost embarrassing.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:01):**  This guy's planting this and he's doing this and he's doing that.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:06):**  And it was all over it.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:09):**  So Bill was sort of familiar with all of that and asked me to write a book about process  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:14):**  because we had discussed that.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:18):**  I said, you know, that permaculture from my perspective almost, and he didn't like me  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:24):**  saying this to me, it became like a franchise.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:28):**  And yeah, we had a sort of a start off a bit heated about that when I said that, but he  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:38):**  sort of got it.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:39):**  And I said, well, you know, and then there's the, I said, then that's actually probably  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:43):**  possible if you taught people a solid process, then that process allied with the principles  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:51):**  of permaculture probably roll on through.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:09:56):**  If someone had adequate training, worked under someone who knew what they were doing and  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:01):**  stuff, then that's probable because the whole permaculture package as it were, well, or  
**[0:10:09-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:09):**  franchise as I put it was that you did this 10, 12, 14 day permaculture design course,  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:17):**  got that package of information.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:20):**  And it was originally called the permaculture design consultants course.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:25):**  And that was with that idea that you got that package and then you could go off and pretty  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:31):**  well work anywhere in your pretty well.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:34):**  And I think that still happens today with some of these folks that give people that  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:39):**  sort of license to go and do that, which as I said, with Bill, I mean, I don't feel really  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:44):**  comfortable with that because I think landscapes and people and businesses and capital are  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:51):**  all pretty complex.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:53):**  You shouldn't really do that.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:10:54):**  So in terms of the processes, I was pretty clear on what it took to develop a property.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:11:13):**  And if I stepped forward to when I did the first online recs in 2017, I actually went  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:11:20):**  back to the, what we called our works pattern that I developed in, I think 97 or 98, which  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:11:27):**  was our works process.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:11:30):**  And I taught that for the first two recses and then went sort of back to the future in  
**[0:11:38-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:11:38):**  a way in that I used the Regrins platform as the basis for the remaining recses.  
**[0:11:47-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:11:47):**  So the process of running a job as a consultant project manager is actually, and that's what  
**[0:12:00-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:00):**  I suppose I re-found out when I did the first two online recses, I found that actually that's  
**[0:12:09-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:09):**  limited because you actually need to have a foundation to work from in order to be that  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:21):**  consultant and to be that project manager.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:25):**  And I didn't deliver that in those first two recses because, and that's, I think where  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:31):**  the genius of something like permaculture is really good and holistic management for  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:35):**  that matter is that you've at least got more so with holistic management, you've got a  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:40):**  really solid framework, permaculture you've got a list of principles and three ethics.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:47):**  So that is a foundation to leap from.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:50):**  Let me see if I can break that down a little bit in case I didn't understand it correctly.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:12:54):**  So the process part, it's often what is talked about that is lacking in permaculture design  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:01):**  courses.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:02):**  People end up with a bunch of concepts, pattern understanding, and no real, I guess, framework  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:09):**  like you mentioned in order to put it into practice and make decisions.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:13):**  And that is something that the Rex platform has always been known for kind of excelling  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:17):**  at.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:18):**  And I would imagine that's largely because of your previous experience in contracting  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:22):**  and executing on projects.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:27):**  Then the other framework with holistic management that you mentioned and use a lot in your teaching  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:33):**  as well, the idea there is that it helps you to make decisions, maybe not necessarily giving  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:39):**  you a playbook of how to implement them.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:42):**  Although when you get into the stuff about actual animal management, it does get a lot  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:46):**  more specific and I'm actually taking on financial management.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:52):**  And it is a very animal livestock centric package.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:13:57):**  Although again, the principles in that are widely applicable, just most of the teaching  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:01):**  material, much like permaculture with gardening is done through grazing animals.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:06):**  And I haven't seen it adapted too much for other contexts, even though I've heard of  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:10):**  a lot of stories where it's been applied to other things.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:13):**  And then, so in your case, you're saying that there needs to be a foundation of knowledge  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:18):**  and pattern understanding before you can start to work with a process or the process comes  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:24):**  first and you add information on top of it afterwards.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:28):**  Well I think the piece that I failed to mention there is the key line part and that's the  
**[0:14:34-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:34):**  big, you might say download from key line and all of this is the scale of relative permanence.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:42):**  And as I've gone along, because if I go back to permaculture one, for example, permaculture  
**[0:14:53-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:14:53):**  one sort of, well, it did list and adjust to create its own scale of permanence.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:15:01):**  It more or less stuck to what Yeomans did.

**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:25:37):**  I felt, well, actually scale of permanence in itself is a limitation.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:25:42):**  It's again, it's restricting people's ability to express context, their own context or their

**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:26:13):**  And an aid memoir differently to have, so most people in this space who, who are exposed  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:26:21):**  to an aid memoir is, well, it's an aid of memory as you'd expect in French.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:26:27):**  But most people in this space recognise it through Alan Savory's use of it in the 17

**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:26:46):**  If you look at the military applications of aid memoir, it is, it can be just a checklist

**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:27:05):**  or, and, you know, Alan's a pilot too, you know, and pilots when they, when they, when

**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:27:27):**  And that's, that's where we are now, I think.

**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:27:40):**  at this stage, I feel fairly settled with that.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:27:43):**  But I said that about other things in the past.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:27:47):**  Now that you said it, you're going to have to eat your words at some point.

**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:27:52):**  But that's okay.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:27:53):**  At least, well, it is.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:27:55):**  And you've got to be prepared for that.

**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:28:37):**  So up to when I was 18, I went out of my state twice.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:28:43):**  So Victoria, Victoria is a very, Victoria is about 15,000 square kilometres bigger than  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:28:50):**  Great Britain.

**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:28:55):**  And it's very geologically diverse.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:28:59):**  And in my contracting period, which was say about the first seven years of between 93  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:05):**  and 2001, I'd put it, 2002.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:10):**  I worked pretty well solely in Victoria and with a couple of spurts out into Southern  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:18):**  New South Wales and South Australia, but mostly in a similar part of the world.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:24):**  By the time I was 18, I'd only gone to central Australia on a school trip.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:30):**  So we went to Uluru and on a bus trip and then flew home.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:34):**  And I went over the river Murray river to New South Wales a couple of times and that  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:38):**  was it.

**[0:29:41-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:41):**  So but meeting Bill Mollison certainly opened me up too, because he, I suppose was kind  
**[0:29:51-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:29:51):**  of similar growing up in, I mean, I wouldn't compare myself, but he grew up a pretty, well,  
**[0:30:01-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:01):**  even though he lost his father when he was 15, I lost mine when I was a baby.

**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:18):**  He's by the ocean, mine in central Victoria on our farm and I had a great child with lots

**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:27):**  So I didn't have much exposure to anything outside of that, but then thanks to, I suppose,

**[0:30:44-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:44):**  his 50, he was probably about the same age as I am now, about 53, 54 when he left Australia  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:52):**  and started.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:53):**  So what year was that?  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:55):**  About 83.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:56):**  So he was born in 1928.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:30:58):**  So yeah, pretty close to my age now before he got out of Australia and started to go  
**[0:31:05-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:05):**  to all these places on this new permaculture bandwagon that he self-created.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:13):**  So that wonder that he sort of showed and so on really fascinated me.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:18):**  And he introduced me to Howard Yanashapiro.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:21):**  Well, Howard came down to Tasmania and I was there teaching with Bill at the time.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:29):**  And he said, I've got this project up in Vietnam.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:31):**  And Bill said, you'd probably be good for it because of your project management experience.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:36):**  And so that was my first foray out of this country was to go to Vietnam, which was curious  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:45):**  in a way, because that was where my father was killed when I was a baby in the war.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:50):**  So and I just happened to land on the anniversary, the 37th anniversary of his death.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:31:57):**  So that was sort of like all a bit freaky, but anyway, out of my control.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:04):**  But that was big and that was a big landing because that was very foreign.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:10):**  I mean, completely different culture.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:13):**  As I discovered, they like to drink and they like to joke and like everyone does all around  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:18):**  the planet apart from a few populations, you know, people are people everywhere.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:23):**  And most people have the same motivations in life and want to raise their families well  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:28):**  and all that.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:30):**  So got that, but that was a big thing.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:34):**  And that opened up my eyes.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:36):**  And what it also gave me a flavor as well, I was getting paid really well and be I was  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:41):**  starting to work pretty closely again with Alan Yeomans and looking at this whole global  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:45):**  warming thing and the whole possibility of carbon farming.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:51):**  This was in about 2005, 2006 and saved up a fair bit of money.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:57):**  And that enabled me to do what I what we did in 2007, which was what I called our interview  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:03):**  with the planet.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:05):**  And so we did a 13 month tour called the Soil, Water and Carbon for Every Farm Tour.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:12):**  So we did all of these, I'm going to say quasi keyline courses.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:17):**  And they were pretty well foundational to what we continued to do right up to the wrecks  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:23):**  as you know it today.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:26):**  So that and it was I mean, we 13 months we went twice.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:30):**  I think we went twice this way and we went a couple of times that way, you know, up in  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:37):**  South America and everywhere.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:40):**  So that was a and when you do courses at the site on farms, as, as a way of traveling and  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:48):**  learning, you certainly get a lot closer to those landscapes than you would as a tourist,  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:55):**  of course.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:56):**  So yeah, that was really powerful.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:58):**  And, you know, we met a lot of amazing people, and some of whom are still really great friends  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:03):**  and very close friends, and we've gone back to their places, our kids have grown up together  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:08):**  and all that.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:10):**  So that's been extremely powerful.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:13):**  And it has helped a lot.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:14):**  I mean, I know talking with you, you've kind of done some of that stuff yourself.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:18):**  And it's, you can't, you can't beat that.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:23):**  That experience?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:24):**  No, no, you definitely have to live it.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:26):**  I'm wondering, of the things that you encountered that you'd never seen before from Australia  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:32):**  and having not traveled so much when you were younger.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:36):**  Did you end up rethinking a lot of what you had learned and kind of reformulating some  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:40):**  of your processes and design?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:43):**  Or did it serve more as a confirmation that the patterns are applicable everywhere?  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:49):**  And despite minor differences, the framework is really solid?  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:53):**  I would say I would say the latter.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:54):**  And I think that's why part of the reason for human success as a species is that, you  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:01):**  know, you got to be on a landscape that works to allow you to be successful.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:05):**  So, and there is enough similarity, you know, rain falls everywhere, gravity works everywhere,  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:12):**  you know, it's plants grow everywhere, animals grow everywhere, you know, there's ecosystems  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:18):**  everywhere.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:19):**  So, yeah, the shapes and sizes and the ways and the species are all different, of course,  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:26):**  and how hot and how cold and when and how much and all that is obviously where the variations  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:32):**  occur.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:33):**  There's gear, and I was gonna say before that the other, I suppose the thing that I reflect  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:43):**  on now is that when you go out there as a, you know, you put these courses together and  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:49):**  out there, you're the guy, or you're the girl, whatever, whatever it is, you're the person.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:35:55):**  And so there's a certain pressure of expectation, I suppose, which I didn't really pay attention  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:00):**  to at the time.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:03):**  And, you know, were I to put my head on now and go and do it again, I would definitely,  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:10):**  I mean, I was participatory, because that's what I learned a lot about when I was working  
**[0:36:16-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:16):**  in Vietnam, this whole participatory training methods and all the rest of it, but I'll probably  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:23):**  be even more so.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:25):**  And at that time, too, I hadn't taken on the whole holistic management stuff as well.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:31):**  So that wasn't really until 2008.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:33):**  So I sort of missed that boat on the first tour.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:37):**  And that would have strengthened that a whole lot more, because it does give that foundation  
**[0:36:48-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:48):**  of motivation that is lacking in most, if not all, of the other land management methodologies  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:36:58):**  out there, permaculture, including keyline definitely included.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:02):**  Sure.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:03):**  And I would say at that point, 2007, my main influences were whole farm planning, keyline,  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:16):**  permaculture and whatever agroforestry is, you know what I mean?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:21):**  Because agroforestry is, it's not really a methodology, I wouldn't call it, it's more  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:27):**  of a set of practices.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:29):**  Like there's no way to do, there's no way, if you like, to do agroforestry.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:36):**  It's the whole spectrum.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:39):**  So, but they were my, I would say my key influences.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:37:43):**  What I was missing was the HM side.

**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:40:46):**  I mean, dreams aren't reality.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:40:48):**  That's just the thing.

**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:41:01):**  the way we teach our courses to just bring people back down to the tin tax.

**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:41:16):**  like when I start the water discussion, I start at the raindrop, because that's where  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:41:22):**  it starts.

**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:41:41):**  as a starting point and realise how they are part of something much bigger, they are part

**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:41:58):**  you are probably going to be a bit more responsible about the way you proceed.

**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:45:47):**  You have to build because it's not like you're the only one who's doing that these days.

**[0:58:16-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:58:16):**  And I said, Yeah, well, I started off with a dumpy level and as well, which is a telescopic  
**[0:58:21-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:58:21):**  level to people, but I've got a laser and it's really good.

**[0:58:31-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:58:31):**  but they're really, really competent tool.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:58:34):**  And I've got, as I said to him, I've got an Emlid RTK GPS, right?  
**[0:58:40-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:58:40):**  Or GNSS.

**[0:58:59-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:58:59):**  Well, I suppose what I'm getting to there is that over the course of the three decades,  
**[0:59:05-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:59:05):**  I've been working in this game, starting off with optical levels of telescopic levels and

**[0:59:19-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:59:19):**  ago and going, wow, isn't that so cool?

**[0:59:25-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:59:25):**  Oh, it's $20,000.

**[0:59:36-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:59:36):**  And I bought two units, I think for about $3,000.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:59:40):**  I think they're more now, but I got in early and it's like, that's serious disruption.

**[0:59:55-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:59:55):**  people like me, the sort of land planning types, where there has been some disruption,  
**[1:00:03-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:00:03):**  but I don't see, there's probably going to be a little bit more disruption to come.

**[1:01:58-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:01:58):**  And I suppose if I had three lives, one of them would be in workshops, making those things

**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:02:22):**  because any improvements on resource use, particularly on fossil fuel use is a good

**[1:03:01-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:03:01):**  improvement.

**[1:16:08-1:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:16:08):**  creating the learning landscape for people to do a much better job as advisors, because

**[1:16:35-1:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:16:35):**  There's still going to be a role for pulling this together.

**[1:17:12-1:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:17:12):**  And well, you know, it's like little nuggets of things that come along.  
**[1:17:16-1:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:17:16):**  We're very lucky that we live in a dynamic and creative space.

**[1:17:27-1:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:17:27):**  minutes and you came up and went, oh, right, he'll do that.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:17:30):**  So there's lots of those little incremental gains.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:17:35):**  Like a lot of people are always, and I think more broadly that people are looking for that

**[1:17:59-1:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:17:59):**  Because sometimes you don't know what's coming.

**[1:18:20-1:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:18:20):**  the dynamics of the way we work.

**[1:18:32-1:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:18:32):**  with occasional bursts of bigger leaps.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:18:37):**  So we're very stoked to have that because that's controllable.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:18:42):**  And it feels like it's something we can keep a handle on.

**[1:18:57-1:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:18:57):**  And being able to not only take my own new project through a lot of the processes that  
**[1:19:03-1:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:19:03):**  you've outlined in the recs, but also coach some of our farmers from around Europe through

**[1:19:12-1:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:19:12):**  And well, through this interview, it's really cool to get an insight into kind of the philosophy  
**[1:19:17-1:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=1:19:17):**  and the thinking that goes behind it, which often doesn't come out in the webinars, which

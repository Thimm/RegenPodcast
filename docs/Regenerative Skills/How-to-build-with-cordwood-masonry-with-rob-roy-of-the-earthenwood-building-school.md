**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello everybody and welcome to this episode of the Abundant Edge.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:05):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:06):**  This is the podcast all about the worlds of natural building, permaculture, and regenerative  
**[0:00:10-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:10):**  living, so let's jump right on in.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:12):**  Thanks so much for joining us.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:22):**  Our guest today is Rob Roy, one of the preeminent voices of cordwood building in the world and  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:27):**  also the founder of the Earthwood Building School in West Chassie, New York.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:32):**  Rob is a prolific world traveler who used to teach water skiing in the US, Australia,  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:36):**  and South Africa where he won the trick skiing event in 1967.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:41):**  Aside from cordwood masonry, he is a renowned teacher of megalithic stone construction and  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:46):**  has authored 17 books on subjects ranging from natural building to mortgage free living  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:51):**  and world travel.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:52):**  This is another information packed interview in which Rob goes into detail about cordwood  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:00:56):**  construction, megalithic stone moving, mortgage free home ownership, and a lot more, so you  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:02):**  might want a notebook for this one.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:04):**  As always don't forget to check out the show notes on the website at AbundantEdge.com to  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:08):**  find links to all of Rob's books and the Earthwood Building School.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:12):**  Let's get started.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:13):**  I'm here today with Rob Roy.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:14):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:15):**  Hi Oliver, doing well here.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:17):**  How's things in Guatemala?  
**[0:01:18-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:18):**  Oh it's fantastic.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:19):**  It's a beautiful sunny day.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:20):**  How are things for you in New York?  
**[0:01:22-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:22):**  Cold and sunny.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:23):**  Well at least you've got the sun.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:26):**  Yep.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:27):**  Alright so let's jump right in.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:29):**  You have an incredibly impressive body of work as an author, builder, and instructor.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:34):**  How did you get started in all of this?  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:37):**  Well my wife Jackie and I, we needed a cheap shelter.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:42):**  We had been traveling around the country on our land search and in Arkansas we ended up  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:49):**  in a little community called Weedy Ruff and they were building a log home for Joe Mayo  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:55):**  of the Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:01:58):**  And we got signed on to help build this log home but Jackie and I were about 26 years  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:03):**  old and we had trouble hefting these 14 foot long logs.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:07):**  But Joe Mayo had a 1974 National Geographic magazine showing a picture of a lady and her  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:15):**  son had built a cordwood house out in Skahig in Washington.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:19):**  And as soon as Jackie and I saw that picture we said yeah we can do that.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:24):**  He also had a copy of An Age of Barns by Eric Sloane which showed that cordwood masonry  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:30):**  dated back over 100 years.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:33):**  Now I found out it dates back 1000 years.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:36):**  But there were pictures of cordwood barns in the Midwest that were done so we knew it  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:41):**  could be done and that's how we get first turned on to cordwood masonry.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:47):**  We finally bought land in northern New York and a sire that we were getting material from  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:53):**  had seen cordwood up in Ontario.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:02:55):**  So we traveled up to Ontario, found some old cordwood buildings.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:00):**  People were gracious enough to take us into their homes.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:03):**  And on the way home, lo and behold, there's a farmer building a cordwood masonry barn  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:08):**  on the side of the road and we pulled over and he was very gracious to share with us  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:12):**  and put a little extra lime in the mortar.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:15):**  So Jackie's writing down put a little extra lime in the mortar and we came home and we  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:19):**  built our first cordwood barn.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:21):**  Wow, that's remarkable.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:23):**  Now, so for our listeners who are unfamiliar with cordwood building, can you explain to  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:27):**  us how the wall systems work and what the benefits and limitations are?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:31):**  Sure.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:32):**  Cordwood masonry is a style of building where you construct a masonry wall of wooden elements  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:38):**  called log ends.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:39):**  Instead of stone or brick or block, you use the log ends.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:42):**  They're generally round or split logs and they'll be the same length as the width of  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:47):**  the wall, 12 inches, 16 inches, whatever.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:51):**  The special characteristic of cordwood masonry is the insulated mortar joint.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:03:56):**  There's an insulated space between the inner and outer mortar joints and this is critical.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:01):**  This is what makes it possible to heat the cordwood home.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:05):**  If you had a solid mortar joint through the wall, you would simply conduct heat right  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:09):**  through the wall and it would be what Malcolm Wells used to call an energy nosebleed.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:14):**  So this insulated space is critical.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:16):**  We can heat our little round cordwood sauna with only 8 inch walls, we can heat it in  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:21):**  sub-zero temperatures up to 165 degrees Fahrenheit in two hours with a wood stove.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:26):**  Wow, that's some incredible statistics.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:30):**  Can you explain a little bit more about how this double mortar joint works?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:34):**  The order of events is, say you're working on the foundation, you'd mark out where the  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:40):**  inner and outer parts of the wall are with perhaps an indelible marker and then you'd  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:45):**  lay down two mortar joints.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:46):**  On a 12 inch wall there'd be an inner 4 inch wide joint and an outer 4 inch wide joint.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:51):**  Then you would pour your insulation between the inner and outer mortar joints.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:04:55):**  We use sawdust which has been treated with lime at the ratio of 12 parts of sawdust to  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:02):**  one part of lime.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:03):**  So we'll put it in a spouted bucket, we'll pour the sawdust between the inner and outer  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:08):**  mortar joints.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:09):**  Now your mortar's down, your insulation's down, you're ready to lay a log end.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:13):**  The log end is laid transversely in the wall much like you stack a rank of firewood for  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:18):**  drying.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:19):**  So you take your log end, you place it on the mortar, a gentle vibrating motion back  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:23):**  and forth is all you need to get a good bond to the wet water.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:27):**  And then you just continue.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:29):**  I like to go with a random first course.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:33):**  That is to say I choose a variety of different sizes of log ends in the first course and  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:38):**  this sends the wall into what we call a random rubble style.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:42):**  We say the wall builds itself because when you put down the next mortar joint you're  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:47):**  creating little hills and valleys and it suggests the next log end to go in there.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:52):**  So the wall is more or less building itself.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:55):**  It doesn't use, you've got to be careful that you don't get too many of one size together  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:05:59):**  because you might deplete that size of log ends.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:01):**  But keep an eye on things and let the wall build itself.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:05):**  Now I assume that the lime that you're putting in with the sawdust is to prevent it from  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:12):**  rotting?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:13):**  Yeah, it stops deterioration from insect or other vermin infestation.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:18):**  It also will set up with the sawdust in case the wall gets wet from any reason, a driving  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:25):**  rainstorm, rain during construction, reasons you can't think of.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:30):**  The lime will set up with the sawdust and give you a kind of rigid foam product instead  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:36):**  of a loose fill insulation like vermiculite, it becomes rigid foam.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:40):**  But in 99% of cases that never happens.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:43):**  And I've torn corded walls apart 25 years later, for example, to expand a window into  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:48):**  a door.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:49):**  I've had to take a little section of corded out and that sawdust is still as good and  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:54):**  fresh and light and fluffy as the day it was installed.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:06:57):**  But if it does get wet, and we saw this happen once too, we took a wall down and it was kind  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:03):**  of like a beadboard product.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:05):**  The sawdust and lime had created a kind of a dry beadboard product when the wall got  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:12):**  wet.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:13):**  But it was still acting as insulation.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:15):**  So yeah, the sawdust and lime mixture is a good idea.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:20):**  It's a good natural insulation.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:21):**  There's other things you can put in there.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:23):**  You can put in vermiculite or hemp or quite a variety of things.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:29):**  We started by using fiberglass.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:31):**  We gave that up after a few months.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:33):**  It was Jack Henstridge in New Brunswick that told us about the sawdust and we've been sticking  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:39):**  with the sawdust ever since.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:40):**  Yeah, as someone who's worked a lot with fiberglass when I was a marine engineer, I could definitely  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:44):**  recommend to not use it whenever possible.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:48):**  There are occasions where it's useful, say you're up under the underside of a girt.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:53):**  The girt is the timber that joins two vertical posts.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:07:57):**  And you can't pour your sawdust into that last mortar joint, but you can take strips  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:02):**  of fiberglass and with your gloved hands you can stuff that fiberglass into that last space.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:07):**  Very hard to get the sawdust insulation in there.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:10):**  Oh sure, that makes sense.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:11):**  Now what do you use for the mortar?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:15):**  Well we use a variety of mortars.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:17):**  The one that is the most forgiving that people have the least problem with is a mortar that  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:24):**  Jackie and I developed over a two year period.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:27):**  Again, it has sawdust in it, but this sawdust is not for insulation.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:32):**  The sawdust we use in this mortar, and I'm going to give you the recipe in just a second,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:36):**  but the sawdust is used, the soaked wet sawdust, not dry sawdust, and it's in there to retard  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:43):**  the mortar set.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:45):**  Because if mortar sets too quickly, it'll shrink and cause cracking between the log  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:50):**  ends.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:51):**  So we discovered that just the right amount of wet sawdust to put in there to retard that  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:56):**  mortar set.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:08:57):**  The dry log ends will suck the moisture right out of the mortar, cause a rapid drying, and  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:03):**  when any cementitious material dries quickly, it's going to shrink and crack.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:08):**  So our mix that is a good reliable mix, very forgiving mix, is Portland cement, hydrated  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:17):**  lime, type S builder's lime, soaked sawdust, and what's called mason sand or masonry sand.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:24):**  It's a fine sand along the lines of granulage, you know, the sugar that you put in your coffee.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:31):**  So the recipe is nine parts of sand, three parts of lime, three parts of the soaked sawdust,  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:42):**  and two parts of Portland.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:44):**  Those are equal parts by volume.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:47):**  And that's a very forgiving mix.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:49):**  As long as you've got good sawdust, which needs to be a soft wood sawdust, this is a  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:54):**  very forgiving mix and there's very few problems with it.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:09:58):**  If you haven't got good sawdust, if all you've got is hardwood, you might not have the right  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:04):**  kind of sawdust to use as a cement retarder.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:07):**  So you can use a commercial cement retarder.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:11):**  Various companies make a product called cement retarder.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:14):**  And that's a liquid that you would not put the sawdust in, but when you place the water  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:19):**  in the wheelbarrow, a little crater of water, you'd add your three ounces of cement retarder  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:24):**  and that'll do the same job as a wet sawdust.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:26):**  So in that case, we add an extra shovel full of sand to take away from the sawdust that's  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:33):**  been taken out and that cement retarder will do the same job.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:38):**  It'll stop the water from shrinking and cracking.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:41):**  Excellent.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:42):**  That actually helps answer one of the other questions I had because the only real complaint  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:48):**  that I ever hear about cordwood buildings is that there tends to be a bit of a separation  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:52):**  between the cordwood and the mortar.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:54):**  And is this the best way that you found to help to prevent that?  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:10:58):**  Now the separation between the cordwood and the mortar is generally because of wood shrinkage.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:06):**  Your mortar is pretty stable.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:07):**  Mortar mix I just described.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:09):**  And if you go on, some of the green buildings that you use in the Portland cement, and I  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:14):**  don't blame them because I don't know if you're aware of it Oliver, but 10 to 12% of the energy  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:18):**  usage on this planet goes towards the manufacture of Portland cement.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:24):**  Look down in Central America and South America, all the buildings are made of concrete, concrete  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:29):**  blocks.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:30):**  Can you imagine how much Portland cement has to be made to do that?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:33):**  10 to 12% of our energy usage goes to Portland.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:36):**  So I have no problems with people who complain about the use of Portland.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:40):**  You can use lime putty mortar, which has been used for thousands of years, the Mayans used  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:44):**  lime putty mortar in your part of the world.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:47):**  There in Guatemala, the Romans used lime putty mortar.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:51):**  Mr. Vitruvius writing 2,000 years ago gives a recipe of three parts sand and one part  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:57):**  ladi.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:11:58):**  They would make their lime from, the Mayans would use the shells off the beach and make  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:02):**  their own lime, bake that and make their lime.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:04):**  So lime is very much less energy in the Portland cement.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:09):**  There are good lime putty mortars.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:12):**  It's a more precise process.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:14):**  I don't want to go into it on a podcast because over division is a dangerous thing.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:20):**  But you can find in my books and videos how to make a lime putty mortar.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:26):**  People are making a mortar with hempcrete mortar.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:30):**  People are using cob.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:32):**  I did a wall here at Earthwood with Yonto Evans and Linda Smiley, who I believe you  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:37):**  know.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:38):**  We did a cordwood wall with a cob that they made.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:42):**  No cement in it, no lime in it, just a nice cob that Linda and Yonto made with us.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:48):**  That worked very well.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:49):**  I demonstrated this at the 2015 Natural Building Colloquium in Kingston, New Mexico.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:12:55):**  So for the natural builders, cob or lime putty mortar is an option as well.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:00):**  So I get back to the mortar question.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:01):**  I think you had another question, but I've already forgotten.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:04):**  Yeah, that's all right.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:05):**  You answered that really well.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:08):**  If I can just summarize what you were talking about to prevent shrinkage or separation between  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:14):**  the cordwood and the mortar, you need to select, first of all, very dry wood to minimize the  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:19):**  chance of it shrinking.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:22):**  That's right.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:23):**  You have to make sure that there are retardants in your mortar, whether it be sawdust or industrial  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:29):**  retardants.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:33):**  Those are the main things that help to decrease the chance of it shrinking and pulling away  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:37):**  from the cords.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:39):**  Okay, we're going to assume that you're going to use a mortar which is not going to shrink.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:43):**  So now the problem is the wood.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:46):**  You got to be careful because if you use a hardwood for your cordwood and you get it  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:51):**  too dry, there's a more important problem, a more serious problem than wood shrinkage  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:56):**  is, are you ready for this?  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:58):**  Wood expansion.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:13:59):**  Wood expansion is a structural problem.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:03):**  When wood expands, it breaks the wall up.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:06):**  When wood shrinks, it just leaves a little gap around the log.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:10):**  You can take care of that little gap in a variety of ways, which takes me about half  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:15):**  an hour in my classes to go over, but you can take care of wood shrinkage.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:20):**  But wood expansion is a disaster.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:22):**  It can tilt out a round wall.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:24):**  It can knock out stack wall corners.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:25):**  It can uplift the gird on a timber frame.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:28):**  That's how strong, there's no resisting wood expansion.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:31):**  Look how oak trees can break up a concrete sidewalk.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:35):**  There's no resisting wood expansion.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:39):**  But with wood shrinkage, on softwoods, you dry them quite a bit, generally six months  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:44):**  to a year, and you won't have a problem with wood shrinkage.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:47):**  But on the hardwoods, you're taking a chance if you dry them too much because then the  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:51):**  problem of wood expansion can break your wall up.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:54):**  So on the hardwoods, we recommend just cut the wood into log end length, dry it for a  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:14:58):**  month or so, and build with it because even if you were to dry it for a year, it's still  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:03):**  going to shrink on you.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:05):**  So let it shrink.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:06):**  Don't let it expand.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:09):**  And when you're building, keep your site covered.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:12):**  That is to say so that rain can't fall on your wall and cause expansion, you know, swelling  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:18):**  of the wood.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:19):**  Work under cover.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:21):**  That's why I like to build within confines of a timber frame.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:25):**  If you're not going to do a timber frame, if you're going to use cordwood as load bearing,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:30):**  such as with a round wall with no posts in it, or perhaps what we call stack wall corners,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:36):**  where up in Canada they'll build crisscross corners up a few feet, and they'll put the  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:41):**  cordwood between those corners, go up another few feet with the stack wall corners, another  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:46):**  few feet of cordwood.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:48):**  But all the time, they're at the mercy of the elements during construction.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:52):**  Now you can avoid that by building a temporary cover over your work, but that really adds  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:57):**  a lot to the process.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:15:58):**  Sure, now among all those things that you're talking about, what are some of the challenges  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:04):**  that students have when they first get started building with cordwood wall systems?  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:08):**  The challenges?  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:12):**  One common thing we see at our workshops, and it kind of makes us laugh because we just  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:17):**  don't seem to be able to impart, there's a simple order of events with cordwood masonry.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:22):**  You put in it, it's a mantra, and the mantra is mortar, insulation, wood.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:28):**  Now isn't that simple?  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:30):**  Mortar, insulation, wood.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:31):**  How can you go wrong?  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:32):**  And we'll have students, they'll put down the mortar, and then they start looking for  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:36):**  a log in.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:38):**  They haven't put their insulation in, so if they find a log in that fits, they can't put  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:42):**  it down.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:43):**  They picked it up, they can't put it down because they haven't put their insulation  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:46):**  in.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:47):**  You've got to stick to the right order of events.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:49):**  And we find students that even on the second day are doing this.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:53):**  Usually by the third day, they've kept that work done pretty well.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:16:56):**  By the third day, the students are building with good efficiency.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:02):**  Cordwood masonry is a time-consuming process.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:04):**  It's very labor-intensive.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:06):**  But if people come to a workshop, Becky and I can impart to them efficiencies of handling  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:11):**  materials, and not only for speed of building, but also for good build quality, too, because  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:17):**  you don't want logins touching each other.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:20):**  You can conduct moisture that way.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:22):**  You can, it's hard to point it.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:25):**  You want to keep a good one-inch mortar joint all the way around all your logs.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:29):**  We try to impart efficiency of handling materials for speed, because it is a slow process, and  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:34):**  also selection of logs so that you end up with a pleasing, perhaps random rubble style,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:40):**  which we like.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:41):**  With all your logins happening to be the same size, you can just build them regular courses.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:45):**  That's some great advice.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:47):**  So now you were talking earlier about combining techniques of timber framing along with the  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:54):**  cordwood wall systems.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:55):**  And I know that one of your books is titled Timber Framing for the Rest of Us.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:17:59):**  Could you tell me a little bit how this type of timber framing is different from normal,  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:03):**  and how it can be integrated with cordwood masonry?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:06):**  Oh yes, well the timber framing, you can use cordwood masonry with traditional timber framing.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:13):**  By traditional timber framing, I mean the very finely crafted mortise and tenon joints,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:18):**  and all the various joints that define timber framing.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:23):**  People like Steve Chappell and so many others that are teaching wonderful old timber framing  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:28):**  methods.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:29):**  But that's not the way I do it.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:32):**  I do it the way most contractors, owner builders, farmers do it.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:36):**  And that's with commonly available, inexpensive, mechanical fasteners that you can get at the  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:41):**  local building supply store.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:43):**  So it goes quickly.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:44):**  You don't have to have the skills, the special tools.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:48):**  I don't have the patience for doing fine timber framing.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:52):**  So I just screw it.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:54):**  And I can get it up quickly and cheaply.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:56):**  It's strong.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:18:57):**  I put temporary wooden bracing on the side of it.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:00):**  Finally, the cordwood masonry will replace that diagonal bracing.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:05):**  The cordwood masonry, when you fill a panel in between the posts with the girt on top,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:11):**  that stops the building from racking.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:13):**  You know, we put the bracing on a timber frame to stop the building from racking against  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:17):**  wind shear and that sort of thing.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:20):**  Once the cordwood masonry has filled that panel, it does the same job.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:24):**  It stops the building from racking.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:25):**  So I think cordwood masonry works well with either kind of timber framing, but the kind  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:30):**  that we teach is the easier timber framing.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:36):**  I have the highest respect for all the wonderful, you know, Will Beamer.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:39):**  I even belong to the Timber Framers Association, but I don't do it myself.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:43):**  Yeah, fair enough.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:44):**  I've got a lot of respect for those people too.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:46):**  It's quite an art form.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:47):**  Now, does this mean that you tend to shy away from having cordwood walls being load-bearing?  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:52):**  Oh no.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:19:53):**  In fact, the house that I'm speaking to you from right now, Earthwood, is a 2,000 square  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:00):**  foot round, two-story round cordwood building.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:03):**  It's also earth sheltered.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:04):**  Forty percent of the cylinder is earth sheltered on the northern side.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:08):**  But the 60 percent, which is above grade, is all load-bearing cordwood masonry.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:15):**  No vertical posts in the exterior wall.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:18):**  So we were at the mercy of the elements while we were doing the cordwood work.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:23):**  We would move around these special frames that would kind of shield us against the sun  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:31):**  and rain and wind while we built.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:34):**  And then we'd also have to be careful to cover the tops of our walls every night with maybe  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:39):**  metal or plastic to shed any rainwater away from the site.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:43):**  Jackie and I always say to people now, if we were to build Earthwood again, we would  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:48):**  build what's called a hexadecagon.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:50):**  That's a 16-sided building.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:52):**  We would put up a 16-sided post and beam frame.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:20:55):**  Many cordwood builders all over the world have done this in the last 20 years.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:01):**  Get our roof on and work under the umbrella protection of that timber frame.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:06):**  Now one thing I don't have much experience with, we built a few stack wall cornered walls.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:12):**  But up in Canada, they commonly build 24-inch thick cordwood walls with these stack wall  
**[0:21:18-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:18):**  corners where they'll build a corner of crisscrossed 6x6s or 8x8s, go up three or four feet, and  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:26):**  then fill in, stretch a line and build a cordwood to a line between the corners, go up another  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:31):**  three or four feet, repeat, put the windows in the second course.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:34):**  But once again, they're at the mercy of the elements throughout the entire construction.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:40):**  And Oliver Murphy's Law, as you know, is the year that you want to build, is the year.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:45):**  In 1972 in Plattsburgh, New York, near where we live, it rained in the summertime, it rained  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:51):**  56 consecutive days.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:55):**  Well Murphy's Law is that's the year that you want to build your building.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:21:58):**  So that's why I like the timber frame.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:01):**  One last thing on this.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:03):**  It's much easier to sell the idea of cordwood mastery to a code enforcement officer if you're  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:08):**  building within a timber frame, as opposed to having to prove to him he knows nothing  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:12):**  about her, doesn't know anything about cordwood mastery, now you've got to sell them on the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:18):**  load bearing characteristics of cordwood mastery.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:20):**  You've done authoritative tests on the mortar.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:24):**  Yes, it is.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:26):**  If you're concerned about getting a building permit, then that goes a long ways towards  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:34):**  satisfying the code enforcement officer if this building isn't tumbling down.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:38):**  By the way, there is a document out there called Cordwood in the Code.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:42):**  We sell it through Earthford Building School.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:45):**  It's a 56 page document that covers most of the questions that code enforcement officers  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:50):**  have.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:51):**  Not every single one, but it covers R-value, structure, flame spread, fire, all these kinds  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:22:58):**  of issues that code enforcement officers are concerned with are covered in Cordwood in  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:01):**  the Code.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:02):**  You can get it at cordwoodmastery.com website.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:04):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:05):**  I'll put a link to that in the show notes after I publish this as well.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:10):**  Could you go over real quickly some of the statistics from that document?  
**[0:23:14-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:14):**  How does cordwood perform, let's say against fire for insulation value and what type of  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:22):**  climates would it be best to build with cordwood in?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:26):**  Okay, we'll do the first one first is flame spread.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:30):**  The University of New Brunswick many, many years ago, I'm thinking about 20 years ago,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:35):**  they did tests on cordwood walls.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:38):**  They actually had a 16 inch cordwood wall.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:41):**  They put a blowtorch on one side of the cordwood wall for an hour and they couldn't get any  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:47):**  change in temperature on the other side of the cordwood wall.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:50):**  Jack Henstridge, who built a home in a cordwood home up in New Brunswick, he had an internal  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:23:57):**  fire in the house, had nothing to do with the cordwood, but it charred the inside of  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:02):**  the cordwood wall.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:03):**  But, you know, to have fire, you've got to have fuel, you've got to have heat, but you've  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:09):**  got to have air too.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:11):**  And once you've charred the ends of the logs, it goes out.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:16):**  The mortar stops the heat out of the fire and the air doesn't get past the first charred  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:22):**  area.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:23):**  It's very difficult to burn a cordwood house down.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:27):**  And there are flame spread tests done by the University of Manitoba, which appear in Cordwood  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:31):**  in the Code.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:32):**  I think of a situation where the lady's built a cordwood house and her neighbor says,  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:38):**  would you have another cup of tea, Mabel?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:41):**  And she says, no, I don't think I better, actually, my cordwood house is burning next  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:45):**  door and I better go and get my things out of the house.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:53):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:54):**  What does that mean for the R-value then?  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:24:56):**  If you can't get heat through over an hour, how well does it keep out?  
**[0:25:02-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:02):**  Well Professor Chris Dick, who's an engineer, a PE, physical engineer up in Manitoba, has  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:13):**  done authoritative tests on 24 inch cordwood walls with many sensors through the wall.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:20):**  And on a 24 inch wall, he was coming up with an R-value.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:23):**  This is the insulated wall as you described before, with about 1.43 per inch of thickness.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:29):**  So his 24 inch wall was yielding something like an R-35, which exceeds any state or province's  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:36):**  R-value recommendation for a wall.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:39):**  Indeed.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:40):**  That's impressive.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:41):**  So let's shift gears here just a little bit.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:43):**  I know that over the last few decades, you've worked all over the world as a builder and  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:47):**  instructor.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:48):**  How have those experiences informed your building methods and your teaching style?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:54):**  Well I've been more an instructor than a builder.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:25:58):**  Of course building is part of instructing.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:00):**  You have to, before the students can do it, you have to demonstrate how to do it.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:03):**  So we're building to that extent.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:05):**  But I've never actually been a cordwood contractor, with one exception.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:10):**  I did one cordwood contract once with a friend many, many years ago.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:15):**  Basically the cordwood work I do is in our own places, or when we do workshops, all our  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:21):**  neighbors on Murtaugh Hill where we live have cordwood places now because Jackie and I always  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:25):**  need workshop venues to conduct workshops.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:28):**  So there's cordwood saunas, cordwood garden sheds, even the cordwood house that we did  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:34):**  during workshops.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:35):**  But I'm not a contractor, I'm a teacher.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:39):**  I've learned about other kinds of woods in places like South America and Australia and  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:44):**  New Zealand.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:47):**  We built on Hawaii's Big Island near Mountain View which suffers from 200 inches of rain  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:54):**  per year.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:26:56):**  So we tried a number of woods, Hawaiian hardwoods, and we finally ended up with a wood called  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:01):**  Captain Cook Pine.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:03):**  And after we left, our workshop hosts built a beautiful two story hexadecagon about almost  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:12):**  a thousand square feet with a 12 inch, perfectly sufficient for Hawaii, 12 inch cordwood walls,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:19):**  absolutely gorgeous building.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:21):**  In fact, it's featured in my latest cordwood book, Cordwood Building, a comprehensive guide  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:26):**  to the state of the art.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:27):**  There's a chapter about hexadecagon, one on Big Island, Hawaii.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:32):**  So yeah, I've learned about different kinds of woods.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:36):**  Jackie and I use cordwood masonry as a vehicle for travel.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:41):**  We love to travel, you know that because I told you about this, but I used to do a lot  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:47):**  of traveling.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:48):**  And Jackie and I wrote a book called The Coincidental Traveler.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:51):**  And one of the pieces of advice we give in there is take advantage of yourself.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:27:56):**  So we'll go and do cordwood workshops in Spain or Australia and people will pay us to do  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:02):**  that.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:03):**  And gee, we get a free trip and we do a trip once, 60 days in the southern hemisphere.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:09):**  We worked about 20 of those six days and it didn't cost us anything.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:13):**  It was like a free trip.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:15):**  We couldn't stay home that cheap.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:16):**  Yeah, no kidding.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:18):**  That's a fantastic way to travel.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:20):**  That's actually what I've been doing for the last handful of years as well, taking different  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:23):**  natural building contracts and opportunities to assist as a teacher.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:27):**  And that's helped me to get all around the world for the last few years.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:31):**  How many years did you say?  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:32):**  Because your sound is breaking up a little bit.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:34):**  Oh, um, I guess it's just been the last handful of years since I got into natural building  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:39):**  is about five years ago now.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:41):**  But even before that, I was traveling for a long time doing all sorts of different jobs.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:45):**  I've only just recently switched in the last half decade into doing natural building and  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:50):**  permaculture design consultations.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:53):**  Good.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:54):**  Now, I know that you have an unusual masonry skill when it comes to moving incredibly large  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:28:59):**  stones.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:00):**  Can you tell us a little bit about the megalithic stone revival?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:03):**  Yeah, that's actually I wouldn't think of it as.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:08):**  Masonry, I think of it as I call it megalithics.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:14):**  It's using compound leverage, using mechanical advantage to move very large stones.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:20):**  And you know, it is said wisely, whatever exists is possible.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:24):**  So the pyramids exist.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:26):**  So somebody did that.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:27):**  It wasn't done by spacemen.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:28):**  I'll tell you a little story.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:31):**  This actually took place in Guatemala, a place called Kirigua.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:35):**  I ended up at Kirigua, it's a Mayan city in western Guatemala, and I wanted to see a stellar  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:44):**  E, which was a 50-ton stone.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:47):**  It stood 30 feet above the ground.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:49):**  It was the largest Mayan stellar ever erected.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:52):**  And I wanted to just go see the stone because I'm project director for a 50-ton stone here  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:57):**  in New Paltz, New York.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:29:59):**  So we go there, and see there's this film crew from some program called Space Aliens,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:08):**  Alien Building or something, and their point of view was that people couldn't have done  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:12):**  this.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:13):**  Spacemen must have come and done it.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:15):**  So I can't get near the thing to photograph it because these guys are doing the spacemen  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:19):**  program.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:22):**  But they're waiting for me to interview about the spacemen moving this stone, so I get to  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:29):**  talking with them and they say,  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:30):**  Hey, you seem to know a lot about moving these big stones.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:32):**  Can I interview you?  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:34):**  So I said, sure, but you might as well know I don't believe the spacemen did it.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:37):**  That's the story.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:38):**  He says, we like to give an alternative point of view.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:40):**  So I'm talking about how you can mechanically move the stone, and this good-looking young  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:45):**  man is standing aside, very quiet, very authoritative looking, wearing a kind of a uniform, and  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:50):**  he's listening very carefully.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:51):**  At the end of the interview, he comes over to me and he says,  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:54):**  Excuse me, may I have a word with you, please?  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:56):**  Oh, I said, yes, certainly.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:30:57):**  Well, he's the director of archaeology there at Cary-Guath.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:01):**  And he says, we have a large Mayan stellate that was brought in from the banana fields,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:07):**  and we wonder if you could look at it and tell us how we could manually erect this stone.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:12):**  So I said, well, certainly, I'm happy to do that.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:14):**  His name was Jose Crazborn.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:16):**  He's moved to another part of Guatemala now.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:18):**  So Jackie and I looked at the stone, we measured it, figured out it was a 12-ton stone.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:24):**  We told him how he could move it.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:26):**  He was willing to, he spoke Mayan and Spanish and English, so he was willing to translate.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:31):**  He could get a bunch of Mayan people together and we would move this thing.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:35):**  But it never came about.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:36):**  All we asked for was pay our way down there and we'll work with you and remove the stone.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:42):**  But of course, as you know, Guatemala is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere,  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:47):**  and they didn't have the money to even pay for us to fly down there, so we never moved  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:52):**  that stone.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:53):**  But to get back to the compound leverage, though, which I think was the thrust of your  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:31:57):**  question, it is possible, using compound leverage, to get a 100 to 1 mechanical advantage on  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:04):**  moving.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:05):**  To give you an idea, we demonstrated transportation and erection of a 20-foot long, 20-ton stone  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:15):**  here at Earthwood and never needing more than 16 people and never using more than materials  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:22):**  that were available to Neolithic people 5,000 years ago.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:26):**  That would be wood, rope, we know they had rope, we have the archeological remains of  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:31):**  the rope that they used, and stone.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:33):**  They had no hard metals, so there was no metal bars or levers or anything like that.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:38):**  Wood and stone and rope, that's what you're limited to.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:41):**  And using compound leverage, we were able to transport and erect Julie Steiner, that  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:46):**  was the stone's name, with never needing more than 16 people.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:50):**  Well, I'll save you the math, that's each one of us, and we're ordinary-sized people,  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:55):**  each one of us was responsible for one and a quarter tons.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:32:59):**  My goodness, that is a lot of weight for somebody to be working on.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:04):**  That mechanical advantage you're talking about must be pretty significant.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:08):**  Yeah, well you can get, it's easy to get a 10 to 1 or 12 to 1 mechanical advantage with  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:14):**  a lever and fulcrum.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:15):**  But you can do better than that.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:17):**  You can let the stone help lift itself.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:20):**  If you work the center of gravity with the stone, I give the example of the seesaw, a  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:25):**  common in teeter totter that kids play on in the playground.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:28):**  So you got these two kids on either end of the seesaw, and they're rocking up and down  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:33):**  on the seesaw.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:34):**  They've got that seesaw at its balance point.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:37):**  If they get off the seesaw, it balances straight across.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:41):**  Now that you're a 10-ton stone, as you work close to the center of that stone, the stem  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:47):**  of the stone is lying on the ground, and you get it up and put it on some kind of transverse  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:53):**  member through the middle of it, and you can rock that stone.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:56):**  It's called a rocking stone.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:33:57):**  Just if you get close to the center of gravity, you can rock it with your hand.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:02):**  But that's a little dangerous.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:04):**  So you can actually lift one end of the stone using the balance point to your advantage,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:11):**  slip a shim under there, then move it in another direction, take a little more effort, put  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:16):**  another larger shim on the other side of the center point, and gradually Jackie and I can  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:21):**  raise a 900-pound 10x10 or 12x12 timber by ourselves and put it on top of two posts just  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:29):**  using a stack of four-part solid concrete blocks by rocking it back and forth and slipping  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:34):**  shims one side of the stack of blocks to the other side.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:38):**  And only one of us is actually lifting it.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:40):**  The other is just slipping the shim one way, and Jackie will slip a shim in.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:45):**  I'll rock it the other way.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:47):**  She'll slip in a bigger shim on the other side of the center of gravity.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:51):**  And in half an hour, we shim this thing up eight-foot high, and we're ready to place  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:56):**  it on the post.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:34:57):**  You do the same thing with a big stone.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:00):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:01):**  I'm sure that kind of mechanical advantage would apply to all sorts of other things in  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:06):**  building in which people exert an unnecessary amount of effort.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:11):**  If they just work to mechanical advantage, they could do with far less of that grunt  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:16):**  work.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:17):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:18):**  It's a wonderful...  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:19):**  Jackie and I, we just like to glue big stones by ourselves just to make features around  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:25):**  our house.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:27):**  And we have a summer camp on Shattagate Lake, and we've made a lot of nice features there.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:32):**  And we'll move a thousand-pound stone by ourselves and set it into place.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:37):**  And we just like to...  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:39):**  It's very empowering.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:40):**  We do megalithic workshops.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:44):**  We have women come up to our megalithic workshops, and one of them said, she said, I feel so  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:48):**  empowered by this that I'm able to move these big stones by myself, just with a few other  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:55):**  girls here.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:35:56):**  So yeah, we taught megalithics in New Zealand and all over North America.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:02):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:03):**  That's definitely one of the most interesting hobbies I've ever heard of.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:07):**  We're due to go back to what we call megalithics 101.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:10):**  We keep on pushing the envelope, and right now Sophia is our stone down in New Paltz,  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:16):**  New York, and she's 32 foot five inches long and by estimate 50 to 55 tons.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:21):**  We haven't erected Sophia yet, but that's advanced to megalithics.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:26):**  We want to get to a megalithics 101, going right back to the beginning of rowing.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:32):**  You can row a stone.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:34):**  Now the stones at Stonehenge, it would have been very difficult to have rolled them on  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:39):**  rollers from Marlborough Downs 20 miles to the north where they originated because there  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:44):**  are some significant hills between Marlborough Downs and Stonehenge, and you cannot roll  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:49):**  a stone up a hill, but you can row it up a hill.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:54):**  You can row it the way you row a boat.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:36:55):**  You put continuous fulcrums along the side of the hill, put several levers on each side  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:00):**  of the stone, everybody lifts the stone up, they walk forward 10 feet, the stone moves  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:06):**  one foot in the other direction with 10 to one mechanical advantage.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:09):**  You set it down, you reset your levers, you row it.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:12):**  You can row up a hill.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:14):**  Picture this.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:15):**  Let's say you've got a one in 12 pitch slope, heck even a one in six pitch slope.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:21):**  You raise the stone six inches, you walk it forward a foot, you raise it down five inches.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:28):**  You've got up a one in 12 pitch slope.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:30):**  You go up six, you lower it five.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:33):**  The stone doesn't care.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:34):**  You've got up a one in 12 pitch slope, you can not row a stone up a one in 12 slope.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:40):**  Yeah, that's a great way of looking how to use that mechanical advantage to get things  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:45):**  around obstacles that you couldn't do by rolling.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:47):**  In fact, I've got some experience doing exactly what you mentioned when I used to work putting  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:37:54):**  in trails in national parks in the southwest around Colorado, Utah, and a lot of working  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:00):**  in the canyons and in mountainous areas, that's all we did was rock work.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:05):**  We did a lot of the fulcrum stuff.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:06):**  I know exactly what you're talking about with rowing the stones.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:09):**  That's really the only way to do it when you can't use machinery.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:14):**  As the founder of the Earthwood Building School, you teach a broad range of skills and building  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:20):**  techniques.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:21):**  What would be your first bit of advice to someone who is hoping to build their own structure  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:26):**  with natural materials?  
**[0:38:29-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:29):**  We want to make use of indigenous materials to build what's lying around.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:38):**  I still teach earth sheltered housing, sometimes called earth sheltered housing.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:44):**  We put little roofs on everything we build and earth was heavily earth sheltered.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:49):**  We lived in a place called Longang Cay which was earth sheltered housing.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:54):**  I remember Paul Isaacson was co-teaching with me for Mother Earth New Mexico Village, most  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:38:59):**  is now 30 years ago.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:01):**  A young fellow from Belize and he was like a woman and people with the straw brim caps  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:08):**  there and they do a lot of building down in Belize.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:14):**  After a 15 minute tirade about making use of indigenous materials, Paul Isaacson has  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:18):**  done this 15 minute lecture.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:21):**  One boy with the straw cap, he raises his hand and he says, Mr. Isaacson, I live down  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:25):**  in Belize.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:26):**  We have no indigenous materials.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:29):**  We just use what's lying around.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:30):**  I said, well, all right, if that's all you've got, use that stuff.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:36):**  It'll be okay.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:37):**  So, yeah, indigenous materials but also recycled materials too.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:43):**  So the building is available now through places like Craigslist.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:47):**  We have stuff to garage sales on the roadside.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:50):**  We've got wonderful windows.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:51):**  Here's a good tip for you people.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:54):**  You want good thermal paint windows?  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:39:57):**  Any decent sized town has a manufacturer of thermal paint windows.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:02):**  Maybe one inch thermal paint with quarter inch glass and a half inch inner air space  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:06):**  between the paints.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:08):**  They have a bathroom called the Pigpen and it's full of pieces.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:14):**  One reason or another, we're never picked up by the customer.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:17):**  Somebody went bankrupt.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:18):**  People were cut the wrong size.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:20):**  It doesn't happen very often.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:22):**  It only has less than 100 that they build but it isn't worth their while to take these  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:28):**  things apart, clean the glass, cut a smaller one from it, so they put it in the back room.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:33):**  So you shop and you buy these things for 10 cents on the dollar.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:37):**  With a cord with a masoning house, you don't care.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:39):**  You'll make a window buck to fit the window that you buy.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:42):**  You don't care if it's three foot by four foot two or whatever it is.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:46):**  You make the window buck to fit.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:48):**  You can get perfectly good, nothing wrong with them, and they'll pay windows for 10  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:52):**  cents on the dollar.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:53):**  Yeah, that's a fantastic resource.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:40:56):**  Now I know you've written extensively on a subject that's of interest to most of the  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:00):**  people who are looking to make a transition into a regenerative lifestyle and that's mortgage  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:05):**  free home ownership.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:06):**  Can you talk briefly about some of the most important steps that someone could take to  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:11):**  owning a home without being tied to debt?  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:15):**  Well, first of all, mortgage comes from the old French meaning death pledge.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:22):**  So know that when you sign a mortgage, you're signing a death pledge.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:27):**  Jackie and I have never had a mortgage and we've adopted a certain number of strategies  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:33):**  to keeping that way.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:34):**  To build a house, first and foremost, you have to have a place to build it.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:38):**  You need the land.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:39):**  We've never had a mortgage, but when we bought our land on Myrtle Hill for the first time,  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:45):**  we paid 20% down and we paid the owner an additional 20% for the next four years.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:51):**  And that's the closest thing we ever had to a mortgage, called the land contract.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:55):**  So that's how we bought the land.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:41:57):**  But by having your own land, now you can use what we call the temporary shelter strategy.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:03):**  That is to say, and this has lots of advantages besides getting a free shelter, the temporary  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:08):**  shelter is this small, it might be a six poster that could later be a sauna or a garden shed  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:14):**  or a guest house or something, but it's something that you can build.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:17):**  Get your practice on that one.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:19):**  Maybe it's timber painting, maybe it's quartered masonry, or straw bale, whatever it is.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:23):**  Get your practice in the temporary shelter, make your $500 mistake there instead of your  
**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:29):**  $5,000 mistake around the main building.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:31):**  Move into the temporary shelter and whatever you've been paying for shelter in your life  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:36):**  up to this point, that's finished now.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:39):**  Maybe you're paying $500 a month for rent somewhere, or people pay more than that in  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:45):**  some places.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:46):**  So now for a couple thousand dollars, you've built not only a good building, which we call  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:52):**  it a temporary shelter, but it's by no means a temporary structure.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:42:56):**  It's a good structure for sauna, garden shed, guest house, whatever down the road.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:02):**  Or maybe your master bedroom or something in your main house.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:05):**  So the temporary shelter strategy gives you a chance to learn the building technique.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:10):**  Use the same building technique that you want to do on your temporary shelter that you're  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:15):**  going to do on the main one.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:17):**  Learn the technique.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:18):**  Screw up on the main one instead of the main one.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:22):**  So the temporary shelter strategy is a very positive one.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:27):**  The Mortgage Free book goes through various strategies of how to find and buy land.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:32):**  Land's important.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:33):**  It talks about indigenous materials, finding recycled materials.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:38):**  Oh boy, I can't think of all of them.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:41):**  It's a 340 page book, so it was kind of hard to synthesize in three minutes.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:47):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:49):**  And people can always go to, what other resources have you got in order to disseminate that  
**[0:43:55-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:55):**  information?  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:43:56):**  Well, I might just mention that the Mortgage Free book is out of print.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:01):**  However, Chelsea Green Publishing Company still keeps it as an e-book.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:06):**  Kindle or something, I don't know how to use these things.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:12):**  You can still get it from Chelsea Green as an e-book.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:16):**  Or you can go to Amazon or other similar sites and buy a used copy.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:21):**  Okay, so while we're on that subject, where can people find more information about your  
**[0:44:26-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:26):**  book?  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:27):**  It's about the Earthwood Building School and some of the other books that you've written.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:33):**  Okay, our website is a clearinghouse for everything that you just asked me.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:38):**  It has our workshops listed out there.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:41):**  This year we have workshops here in New York in May, July, and September.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:46):**  It also has what's called the Books and Media page.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:48):**  You click on the top one.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:50):**  The website is cordmasenry.com and click on Books and Media and all my books and DVDs  
**[0:44:59-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:44:59):**  come out.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:00):**  Even the Stone Circle stuff is in there.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:02):**  Although my book Stone Circles is also out of print, I did buy up a lot of copies before  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:07):**  I went out of print and I sell Stone Circles and Stone Circles video as well on the website.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:12):**  Go to the website, check out the workshop page.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:17):**  We have accommodation here.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:18):**  If you come to the workshop, we have four different houses that people can stay at.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:24):**  We teach all sorts of housing.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:26):**  We're doing timber framing this year, timber framing for the rest of us in May.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:32):**  And it looks like we're doing it under Barcelona in Spain too.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:37):**  So as soon as we get that firm down, I'm going to put that on our website with a link to  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:41):**  the people in Spain in case Europeans happen to go to this and want to go to a workshop.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:46):**  That's June 17th to the 21st in June near Barcelona.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:54):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:55):**  That's a huge wealth of resources and information.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:45:59):**  Thank you so much for taking the time for the interview today.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:02):**  I really appreciate, man, that's a very chock full interview of actionable and practical  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:09):**  advice.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:10):**  So I thank you for that.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:11):**  Oh, you're very welcome.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:12):**  Nice talking with you.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:13):**  And how long are you going to be in Guatemala?  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:17):**  Maybe we can come down and visit sometime.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:19):**  That would be fantastic.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:20):**  Are they temporary?  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:22):**  Well, I'm looking forward to getting in touch with the other people that you've done cordwood  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:26):**  buildings with that you mentioned earlier.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:29):**  And right now it's a little bit open ended.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:31):**  I've got quite a few projects going right now, which are keeping me busy.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:35):**  But because the business is going well, there's always inquiries and potential projects all  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:41):**  over the world.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:42):**  So I'm not sure where I'll be at any given time.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:44):**  Well, it's one of our favorite countries to visit.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:47):**  Jackie and I have been full-time to Guatemala.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:49):**  We have a very strong interest in the minds of the land nation.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:53):**  And there's so many natural features in Guatemala that we love to visit.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:57):**  The people are wonderful, as you know.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:46:59):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:47:00):**  Yeah, this is the fourth time that I've come back to this country and I love it every time.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-008-rob-roy-coming-soon/#t=0:47:05):**  So yeah, I would recommend it to anyone.

**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:03:25):**  This first session dives into how Akiva first began to propagate trees, and his transition  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:03:30):**  into making a business out of it, and supporting his family by growing plants.

**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:04:50):**  Akiva, how did you get started working with and propagating plants?  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:04:55):**  I know this goes back quite a ways with you.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:04:58):**  Yeah, I started off not thinking about gardening or growing anything.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:05):**  I was just into foraging and hunting and trapping and primitive skills, basically, and really  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:13):**  wilderness survival.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:16):**  But with Stone Age technology, I didn't want to go any higher than that.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:21):**  I was kind of a radical, I guess.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:28):**  But then every time I started to understand that people can impact the world in positive  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:36):**  ways, not just negative.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:37):**  I was always trying to minimize my impact, and then I started to realize that people  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:42):**  could actually have a big impact, but it could be a positive one for wildlife.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:47):**  And once I realized that I could add diversity to a landscape, that I could increase wildlife  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:05:55):**  populations, then I got pretty excited about growing stuff.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:00):**  And the first time I grew trees, I was eating an apple, and I got a bit into the core, and  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:07):**  I saw the shiny brown seeds there.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:11):**  And I was just like, I wonder what would happen.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:13):**  And I put those seeds in a pot, and they sprouted a couple weeks later.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:18):**  And then I remember seeing them sprout and thinking, oh my God, each one of those is  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:25):**  an entire apple tree.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:26):**  And I was just hooked since then.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:28):**  I just started trying to grow as many trees as I could, as many different species.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:33):**  I just wanted to grow everything.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:36):**  And I've been pretty excited about growing trees.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:39):**  I've been doing that avidly for about 15 years now.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:43):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:44):**  And at what point did you realize that you could actually make a living for yourself  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:47):**  and your family by propagating plants and growing trees?  
**[0:06:51-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:06:51):**  I bought my land in 2009 with the idea of homesteading and just living there, living  
**[0:07:01-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:01):**  close to nature and growing a lot of our food and foraging and stuff.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:09):**  But it sucked going to work.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:10):**  I was always driving to work and leaving the place, and I just wanted to be there.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:17):**  I did a lot of different work, but a lot of it was landscaping, so I would be going.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:22):**  And it was good landscaping.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:23):**  It wasn't just like lame, weird suburban stuff.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:27):**  It was nice properties that people wanted more wildlife habitat.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:32):**  And it was good jobs, but I always just kept wanting to be home because I had so much stuff  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:36):**  I wanted to do on our property.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:39):**  And I was at this mulch pile, a municipal mulch pile, loading up my truck one day.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:47):**  And my friend pulled in and I was telling him how cool it would be to make money at  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:51):**  home so I didn't have to go and work for other people.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:54):**  I had to do plant propagation.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:57):**  And I was like, you're right.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:07:58):**  I just knew it was right.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:00):**  And I had already been propagating stuff, but I started trying to sell it after that.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:04):**  Started on Craigslist.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:07):**  And then I did tree identification walks for land trusts, and I would tell people that  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:13):**  I sold plants.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:14):**  Just slowly built from there, and then I got a website.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:17):**  And once I was willing to ship plants, then the business just took right off and I quickly  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:27):**  quit my job.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:28):**  And did you find right away that there was the demand that almost outstripped what you  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:33):**  could provide?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:34):**  Or did it take a while for you to develop the business aspect to keep up with how much  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:38):**  you were able to propagate?  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:40):**  It took some time, but not that much time.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:44):**  And I think that I put in a lot of work before.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:48):**  So I had been already writing articles and posting them to Native Plant Society newsletters.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:08:56):**  And I had already been working on getting my name out there and building an email list  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:02):**  and posting on forums and stuff like that.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:07):**  So I had done some legwork beforehand.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:10):**  But once we made the website and then I said plants were available for shipping, it was  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:19):**  about two months later that I quit all other jobs.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:26):**  And from the time I decided I wanted to make money growing plants till the time it became  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:33):**  full time was maybe two or three years.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:36):**  It wasn't that long.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:37):**  Sure.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:38):**  But it's still a pretty good trajectory, especially for a small business.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:41):**  Now let's start from the beginning here.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:43):**  What do you think are the most important considerations before starting a tree or a plant nursery  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:48):**  business?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:49):**  I think when you're first starting, there's a couple of things I think are super important.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:09:56):**  So one is have a backup income at first.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:01):**  So it'd be ideal if you're not working a full time job and the nursery, but it's okay if  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:10):**  you are.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:11):**  I was working full time at first, but it's nice if you just have a part time job just  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:16):**  as it takes some of the stress off.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:18):**  Because if you suddenly have this pressure like, oh, now I have to make $50,000 a year  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:23):**  selling plants today, it's not fun anymore.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:28):**  And then what's the point?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:30):**  So if you have some income on the side that you know you can count on, then it makes you  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:37):**  have more freedom to experiment with growing things and not feel like they have to grow  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:42):**  or it's the end of the world.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:45):**  So I think having some income to start is great.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:48):**  And then I think you really have to know what you want to grow.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:53):**  And a lot of people, there's two ways to approach it.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:10:57):**  So if you're like, okay, you're in a plant world, there's so many plants, you can go  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:01):**  for anything from house plants, tropical plants, fruit trees, woodland herbs, it's just endless  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:08):**  how many different types of plants there are.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:12):**  And so a lot of people will actually think, well, what do people want to buy?  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:17):**  And then they'll try to grow that.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:18):**  And I think that's a huge mistake.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:21):**  Personally, I think you really want to think about what do I want to grow?  
**[0:11:25-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:25):**  So you have to understand that if you want to grow it, other people want to grow it.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:32):**  There's so many people that grow plants that are gardening and farming.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:38):**  So you just have to have a little bit of faith that if you're passionate about something,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:43):**  other people will.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:44):**  And then if you're growing something that you're passionate about, you're going to do  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:49):**  a way better job.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:50):**  You're going to do a better job of growing it, and you're going to do a better job of  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:54):**  promoting it, which is really what you need to do.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:11:56):**  You need to convince people that this is a good plant.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:00):**  So I could be like, well, I think there's a lot of money in ornamental shrubs, so I'm  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:07):**  going to grow ornamental shrubs.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:09):**  And then I start growing all these spireas and lilacs that I don't really feel excited  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:13):**  about and trying to sell them.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:15):**  I'm like, yeah, you should grow this spirea.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:17):**  It can't really sell it.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:18):**  I can only sell something that I'm like, you got to try this, this haskap over here that  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:23):**  I'm excited about, or this gumi bush, or this elderberry is amazing.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:26):**  I never see anything grow like it.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:28):**  So if you're selling stuff that you're growing because you love growing it, then that love  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:34):**  will be felt by your customer base, and they'll respond to that rather than feeling like you're  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:41):**  just trying to trick them.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:43):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:44):**  Or you're just trying to make them happy.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:46):**  It's like a relationship.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:47):**  So you're just trying to make somebody happy.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:49):**  It's not the same as if you're just coming from a place of real love.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:54):**  So let's go a little further deeper into that and actually choosing the cultivars.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:12:58):**  So you're starting with the ones that you're really passionate about and that you want  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:01):**  to see more of in the world or that you have a special relationship with.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:05):**  And like you said, it makes it easier to sell it in a genuine way of your own enthusiasm  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:10):**  and excitement.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:12):**  But there are some practical concerns, I'm sure.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:14):**  And you can't just go and find the rarest little species that has never been heard of  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:20):**  by anybody or that there's not really any market for.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:24):**  And there's also the question to be had between a huge amount of diversity and just focusing  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:29):**  on a couple of things that you could do at volume.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:33):**  What were some of those decision-making processes like for you?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:37):**  Well, I actually do think you could pick the rarest little thing.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:42):**  And I think you find people that also think it's cool.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:47):**  And even if they didn't, you could tell them about it and they're like, really?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:52):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:53):**  I think you could do that.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:13:57):**  When I started, I was really into chestnuts.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:00):**  That was definitely the focus by far of what I wanted to grow.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:06):**  And I wanted to grow as many different species of chestnut as I could and hybrids.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:11):**  And I just really was obsessed with them.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:16):**  But I thought that nobody really wanted them.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:21):**  I thought I was the only one, it felt like.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:24):**  I felt like there was nobody wanted chestnuts.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:26):**  And locally, I was connecting with very few people that wanted to plant a lot of chestnut  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:31):**  trees.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:33):**  But I just kept talking about them and writing about them.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:36):**  And they made YouTube videos about them.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:39):**  And now it's ridiculous.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:43):**  I can't even believe I thought that before.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:47):**  I don't know how I made different decisions.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:50):**  Certain things definitely sold out faster than others in the beginning.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:55):**  In the beginning, I was like hackberry.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:14:58):**  It's like a very obscure tree that nobody really knows about.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:01):**  And it has a horrible name.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:03):**  And I couldn't sell hackberries.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:06):**  I remember growing them and then selling like three or four and having a couple hundred  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:13):**  extra and not sure what to do with them and feeling really bad.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:19):**  But now, I had two people write to me recently.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:27):**  One requesting 500 pounds of hackberry seed, which is insane.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:30):**  And then someone else asking for 100 pounds of seed.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:33):**  And then the hackberry trees themselves that I grow are going to sell out immediately.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:40):**  So I don't really know.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:41):**  I think the internet is so powerful in that you can connect with all these different types  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:51):**  of groups of people.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:54):**  And there's a niche market for everything.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:15:57):**  You could be like, I just want to grow medicinal plants that need 90% shade.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:03):**  And you will find a whole group of people that are into that.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:08):**  I really think you can grow anything.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:11):**  And I think that it doesn't matter what you choose as long as you actually are excited  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:18):**  about it.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:19):**  And you do believe that there's other people that are.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:23):**  And if you don't think there's other people that are, maybe look around.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:28):**  Go look at some forums.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:29):**  Do some Google searches.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:32):**  And maybe you won't even find another nursery that does it, which might make it even better.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:38):**  But usually you will find somebody growing and selling things.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:44):**  I can't think of any plants that I want to grow that there isn't a group of people that  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:50):**  would be really into it.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:52):**  Yeah, that is the nice part about having access to such a large community through the internet.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:16:58):**  So let's talk about some of the care for the plants themselves.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:00):**  And especially for people who are new to plant propagation, what are some resources or some  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:06):**  ways of learning that you would recommend and maybe even some tree or plant varieties  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:11):**  that are really easy to get started with?  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:13):**  Well, I know people hate I'm going to say this, but trial and error.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:17):**  Like you just got to start getting your hands in the dirt and trying to put seeds in the  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:23):**  ground, put cuttings in the ground, see what works, see what doesn't.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:27):**  I mean, there's things easy like willows or even though I just had you can sell anything.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:37):**  You can sell them, but sometimes the things that are really popular are harder to propagate,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:45):**  especially some of these berries like sea berries and gummies.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:51):**  What is that called when something gets really popular and everybody wants to wear the same  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:55):**  kind of sneaker or something?  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:56):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:57):**  Like it's in fashion or it's yeah.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:17:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:00):**  Like a fad or something.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:01):**  There's certain plants that are like in fashion right now.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:03):**  It's like sea berries that are like really like everybody's like, I got to grow my sea  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:07):**  berries and like are difficult to propagate.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:09):**  It's slow, right?  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:11):**  Whereas like black currants, it's just like shove a branch in the ground and you have  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:15):**  a huge, beautiful plant the next year with fruit on it, you know, and elderberries are  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:21):**  super easy.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:22):**  Yeah, I think I'm getting distracted by myself.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:27):**  What was the question?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:28):**  No, it's OK.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:30):**  I mean, just talking about where to get started in propagation, you were saying trial and  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:34):**  error, but there's also a couple of varieties that take pretty easily and are pretty forgiving.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:39):**  Right.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:40):**  I really think, you know, it goes back to my original thing I was saying about growing  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:44):**  what you're excited about because everything has a learning curve to it, every plant.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:50):**  But if you're passionate about it and you're like, I really want to grow sea berries and  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:54):**  you're going to figure it out, like none of these plants are that hard.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:18:57):**  Even people who are like, I want to grow, you know, some rare orchid.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:00):**  They figure it out.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:02):**  And before you know it, they're making tons and tons of plants.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:05):**  And then there's a new expert.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:08):**  I mean, you become an expert on it.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:10):**  And in the thing with all these plants is there is a method that's going to work.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:15):**  And once you figure it out, it's like, it's brainless, you know, it's like, once you figure  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:21):**  out how to store and plant chestnut seeds, you kind of got it.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:26):**  Like there's not, it's not, it's not like a real complicated thing.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:32):**  Any of them, even if you're like, well, I always want to do something that requires  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:35):**  a mist system and bottom heat and soft, you know, middle of summer, softwood cuttings.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:40):**  It's like the most difficult propagation there is and that, you know, but then you figure  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:46):**  out your system and it might take you two or three seasons to do it.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:51):**  But once you figure it out, it's endless.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:54):**  You can grow as many plants as you want.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:19:56):**  You know, once you figure out, okay, this is how I can make this plant replicate itself.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:01):**  Then you can replicate it and replicate the replicates.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:03):**  And all of a sudden you've got, you know, 10,000 plants or a hundred thousand plants  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:07):**  or whatever you want.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:08):**  Plant propagation is, it's, you're growing off living things.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:12):**  So it goes really fast once you figure it out.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:15):**  So I think if you just are like, well, I want to grow this thing, then grow it and figure  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:21):**  out a good system.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:23):**  And then, and then you, even for me, I get like bored.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:26):**  I'm like, oh, I already did that.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:28):**  So then I'm like, want to do something else.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:30):**  You know, it's like, once you figure something out, it's suddenly not as exciting anymore.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:33):**  Which I think is a mental problem, but it's okay.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:38):**  No, I think that's really important.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:39):**  Especially, I mean, if you're going to be your own boss, try not to get yourself into  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:43):**  a boring rut.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:44):**  Otherwise it kind of defeats the point of working for yourself, right?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:47):**  Right.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:48):**  It's like, you might as well just be like making sneakers or something.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:54):**  It's gotta be like a little bit challenging and interesting.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:20:57):**  And, but you can also like have other people help you and you know, you can just, and then  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:02):**  you can tell them.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:03):**  So now like I have people that work for me and so I'm like, I'll just be like, start  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:08):**  all those chestnuts over there, start the elderberries there.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:11):**  And then, and then I'll go work on something totally different.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:13):**  Because as I already got the system in place for those species and each species, I think  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:20):**  has its own requirements and nuances.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:24):**  You know, like mulberry seeds are very straightforward, but it took me several tries before I figured  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:30):**  it out.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:31):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:33):**  And whatever varieties or conditions that each person is working in, they're going to  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:37):**  have to find adaptations and specific ways to make it work in their context too.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:42):**  So definitely you, well, it's not even just like your climate and everything.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:47):**  And it's also like you have access to different materials, right?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:51):**  Some people live in urban areas.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:53):**  They have access to like totally different types of mulch than I do.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:21:58):**  So you know, there's a lot of different considerations.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:01):**  For sure.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:02):**  Now, you've said a number of times in your videos and in your writing that you really  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:06):**  don't need anything to start up a tree nursery.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:09):**  You can just start gathering genetic material, either seeds or cuttings and put them in the  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:15):**  ground.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:16):**  You don't even need particularly good soil.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:18):**  That being said, what things do you think are actually worth investing in in the beginning  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:23):**  to get things moving in a direction that you want and perhaps some tools or some equipment  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:28):**  that is really useful to have if you can afford it?  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:31):**  You know, when I started my nursery business, I was raising my, I had babies being born  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:37):**  and we didn't have any extra money.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:43):**  So I never spent a dollar on the nursery that the nursery didn't generate first.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:51):**  I didn't spend like 20 bucks to buy something and then hope to make it back ever.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:22:57):**  But once I started making money, then I felt more comfortable spending it.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:02):**  I would say like one of the best things you can have is a good nursery space, like a good  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:09):**  shovel that because if you're digging, if you're doing trees, but like really good hand  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:15):**  tools makes a big difference.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:16):**  You know, you can go to like King of Spades or A.M. Leonard and get like these tools that  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:22):**  are it's like $100 shovel.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:24):**  And it's all one piece of steel and the blade is twice as long as a regular shovel from  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:31):**  Home Depot or something.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:34):**  And you can get forks like that, too.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:37):**  And then it just makes it so much easier to dig trees out of the ground.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:42):**  So that's one thing I'd spend money on.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:45):**  Building a website is another.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:47):**  But you know, I wouldn't spend like a lot of money on a website, just enough to like  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:51):**  have a page up there and get some presents.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:55):**  What else would I spend money on?  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:57):**  Maybe I'd spend money on soil.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:23:59):**  Like I'll pay somebody to deliver a big dump truck of cow manure.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:05):**  Pretty much, you know, that's money well spent, I think, or wood chips or sawdust or whatever  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:10):**  you have access to.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:13):**  You don't need a truck.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:17):**  Even if you're selling locally, like it's so much cheaper to have items delivered than  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:24):**  it is to pay to keep a truck on the road.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:26):**  Like if you have your little pickup truck and you're driving back and forth to like  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:30):**  the wood chip pile, that might seem cool, but it's so much cheaper just to pay someone  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:35):**  a few hundred dollars to bring you a pile of wood chips.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:38):**  And then you're not paying for maintenance and insurance and upkeep of a truck.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:43):**  The truck is kind of like this, I think it's a real common way that people think that they  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:51):**  want to start a farm.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:52):**  And so they buy a truck and I think it costs a lot of money and I don't think it's money  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:57):**  well spent.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:24:58):**  I think you could save so much money if you're just like, you know what?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:03):**  I just can get shit delivered or stuff delivered.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:05):**  And then you can also like, you can borrow a truck sometimes or rent one, you know, like  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:11):**  let's say you're just doing potted plants and you need to bring them all to a fair.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:15):**  So rent a truck for a day, it's not a big deal.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:18):**  Or just use your regular car and put a hitch on it and get a small trailer because most  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:23):**  cars can tow a couple thousand pounds, even just like a little Honda Accord can tow quite  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:28):**  a bit.

**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:34):**  But as far as buying stuff, I would just buy soil amendments, nice hand tools and a website.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:40):**  I can't think of anything else I spend money on.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:44):**  You can buy seeds and stuff.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:46):**  But make sure you're not spending too much money on seeds that you don't know if they're  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:50):**  going to work or not.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:52):**  Yeah, that's good advice.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:54):**  You forage most of your own, right?  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:25:56):**  You have trees that you know of in your select area and you know when they drop seed or fruit  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:02):**  or whatever and go to collect them there?  
**[0:26:05-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:05):**  Everywhere I go, my eyes are open and I collect seed from parking lots and parks and the woods  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:14):**  and hedgerows and people's yards like all over the place.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:19):**  I'm constantly finding really good mother trees.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:23):**  I just found like an hour ago, I stopped at this, my friend had to go to this grocery  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:30):**  store and on the way I was in the car with him and I saw this wild pear covered in fruit  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:35):**  and it's like almost December 1st and there's this pear tree covering fruit.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:39):**  I was like, wow, I've never seen a pear bearing that late.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:43):**  So that's just really interesting genetics that I can access and it's just right on the  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:49):**  side of the highway.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:51):**  I don't know.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:52):**  And there's just plant material everywhere if you're into stuff and then also build my  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:26:59):**  own stock up over the years.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:01):**  That takes a lot longer than foraging for stuff.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:04):**  But I also visit botanical gardens and arboretums and you're not supposed to collect from some  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:11):**  of these places.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:12):**  Sometimes you just have to take a few seeds or something or because then you're just going  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:20):**  to make it into so much more.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:22):**  You take it back to your place and then I took like one cutting of this Rubykins willow  
**[0:27:27-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:27):**  from an arboretum once and now I have like huge hedges of it and like if somebody said  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:35):**  I want a thousand Rubykin cuttings, it would be no problem.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:39):**  So you can really expand on stuff like that.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:44):**  And what a fantastic way to interact with the environment around you too when you're  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:47):**  constantly looking out for ways and materials to propagate more of the plants that you want  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:52):**  to see more of.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:53):**  Right.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:27:54):**  And I would say like it's not coming from like an attitude of greed of like, where can  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:00):**  I get?  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:01):**  What can I get?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:02):**  It's more just like I'm really fascinated by plant communities.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:05):**  Like everywhere I go, I'm just like and what people are doing to them is like amazing to  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:10):**  me, you know?  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:13):**  And so everywhere I go, I'm just curiously looking at the landscape to see like, oh,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:18):**  look that hillside is covered in this brush.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:21):**  You know, autumn olives really took over here or like this all oak and it's all stunted.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:26):**  And everywhere I go, I'm constantly I love looking at plant communities because they  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:33):**  like tell stories of all this stuff that's happening just by looking for those stories  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:38):**  and just trying to see, you know, where do the deer go and where are songbirds and what  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:44):**  are people doing with these lawns and where's their hedgerows and what are those hedgerows  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:49):**  made out of and how does that plant behave?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:52):**  And just by doing that, I naturally find mother trees where I'm like, whoa, it'll just be  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:28:58):**  like all of a sudden, like, whoa, you know, he stops you in your tracks when you see an  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-1/#t=0:29:04):**  exceptional specimen.

**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:15):**  We're going to try this out as an experiment.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:18):**  We are halfway through the regenerative design course that I'm organizing here at the Green  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:24):**  Rebel Farm.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:25):**  I'm here with a number of the participants who voiced an interest in interviewing me  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:30):**  to save me from a whole bunch of extra editing that I'm not prepared for to release the episode  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:35):**  that would otherwise come out this week.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:38):**  I think that gets us caught up.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:39):**  Who is part of this group?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:42):**  Go ahead and introduce yourselves in whatever order you would like.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:46):**  I'm Sian.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:49):**  A little bit more?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:51):**  I'm Sage Bryant.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:55):**  From South Africa.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:56):**  You and I have been in touch for a while.  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:58):**  That is correct.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:00:59):**  Oliver, you have been a pretty significant part of my journey so far.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:07):**  My name is Patrick.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:08):**  I'm from London.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:10):**  I've been listening to the podcast for a long time and I'm really excited about the potential  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:16):**  of changing the food system to create a better future for us.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:22):**  Who else is going to speak on this?  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:24):**  There's a bunch of people sitting here.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:26):**  Sajte.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:27):**  Half of the two Sajtes.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:32):**  Me and my wife Irma, we cycled all the way to the Green Rebel where we are right now.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:37):**  I'm very enthusiastic on the course.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:42):**  I'm Dutch.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:43):**  You will hear it directly, I think.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:45):**  I'll do my best to hide it.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:48):**  Nice.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:49):**  Okay, so the idea here is that you guys are going to turn the microphone around on me  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:01:54):**  today and I have no idea what these questions are that you've prepared.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:00):**  So we're just going to roll with it.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:02):**  Take it away.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:03):**  Whoever wants to start.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:04):**  Alright, so what is the holistic context plan and why do you recommend it for people who  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:10):**  maybe want to buy land or have plans for food crime?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:15):**  Alright, so Patrick is talking about holistic management, a framework for managing complexity  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:21):**  that was originated by Alan Savory and the Savory Institute.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:25):**  And it's something that I use in this course on regenerative design because it's a really  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:29):**  good way of starting to understand the direction and managing difficult decisions that you're  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:36):**  inevitably going to have to make when you're dealing with the complexity of living systems.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:41):**  And it's something that I often start the course on because it helps you get in touch  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:46):**  with things that are really important to you, evaluate your own value system.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:51):**  And if you're making these decisions with a larger group outside of yourself, whether  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:02:55):**  it's a couple or a family or an organization, a business, whatever, it helps you to get  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:00):**  on the same page as to what it is that's truly important to you and what you're willing to  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:06):**  do in order to achieve that.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:08):**  And this has a lot of implications for designing for regenerative systems out on the land but  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:13):**  can just as easily be applied to anything in your life, whether it's your personal finances  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:18):**  and how you manage your relationship with people or how you develop a business.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:24):**  All of this is useful to have a general understanding within the people who are given the ability  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:30):**  to make decisions for the organization so that you're on the same page, so that you  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:34):**  agree with what it is that you're trying to accomplish because otherwise you could just  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:38):**  as easily be moving or putting your efforts into things that diverge from one another  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:42):**  and that can break up the cohesiveness and cause things to fail.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:48):**  I have been through the full holistic management training.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:52):**  I haven't finished a lot of my test work to be a professional, accredited professional  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:03:59):**  with the Savory Institute, partly because I still have some doubts as to whether or  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:02):**  not that's really where I want to put all of my energies, but I've gotten a lot of value  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:06):**  out of the system for managing complexity because when you're pushed to think holistically,  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:14):**  there's just so many pieces of data and information both from the land but also the complexities  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:20):**  of our interpersonal workings, the difficulties and nuances of the relationships both with  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:27):**  individuals and with communities and it's just a lot to take in.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:31):**  And to have this as a framework to help you make difficult decisions I found extremely  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:36):**  useful and I've relied on it time and time again when working with clients, when doing  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:40):**  designs increasingly for my own property and it's something that I think is helpful regardless  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:48):**  of what stage of this process that you're in, whether you're completely new to it and  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:52):**  getting clear about some things that are important in your life and what it is you want to achieve  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:04:57):**  in the future, but also even if you've been in a long-term relationship or been in a part  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:02):**  of a business for a long time or maybe have even lived on the same piece of land for a  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:07):**  long time, often these questions haven't been asked or we're not used to answering them  
**[0:05:11-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:11):**  and to use it as a way to analyze the things that unite us and that can help us to work  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:21):**  in synchronicity towards a common goal is always useful.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:25):**  So that's why I put emphasis on it in this course.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:28):**  So besides the podcast, what else are you doing with your time and could you tell us  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:33):**  a little bit about the services that you offer?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:36):**  Oh boy, thank you, Shannon.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:38):**  I'll go straight into my full advertisement pitch.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:42):**  No, I have a lot of projects going on and some of these I've mentioned on previous episodes.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:47):**  I have the closest thing to a day job that I've had in a really long time.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:51):**  I work with a company called Climate Farmers that is working to scale regenerative agriculture  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:05:56):**  here on the continent of Europe with a very talented and wonderful team that does things  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:00):**  that are way beyond my skill set, especially on the technological side of putting together  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:05):**  a high value carbon credits that measure much more than carbon, but a lot of ecosystem services  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:10):**  that are dependent on the way that we manage farmland and help to bring financial instruments  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:18):**  into facilitating people's transition towards regenerative management, which is difficult  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:23):**  enough in itself and it's very hard to find financing for.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:27):**  So I'm proud to work with that organization.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:29):**  I work as a transition facilitator.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:34):**  So farmers in our network come to us looking for solutions to specific problems and I get  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:39):**  a lot of joy in being able to connect them with other people who can help them, sometimes  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:44):**  being able to help them directly myself or share educational resources or other forms  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:50):**  of support within our network and also managing a community that facilitates their ability  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:06:55):**  to connect with peers and share ideas and solutions from their own experience, which  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:01):**  is often difficult to do, especially in the European context because there's so many different  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:05):**  cultures and languages that make communication across the borders of this continent harder  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:12):**  than perhaps in the United States or in Australia where there's more of a common culture and  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:16):**  language that unites them.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:19):**  That takes up a lot of the time of my week.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:21):**  I also work with a number of private clients that have come to me either through my online  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:25):**  courses or through the podcast looking for assistance in developing their own regenerative  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:30):**  projects.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:32):**  Mostly I focus my time in those who have projects fairly near to where I work because it's really  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:37):**  important for me to be able to go out and visit them in person.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:41):**  There's a connection and a level of data and information that just cannot be gathered entirely  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:47):**  online.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:48):**  So to be able to make land assessments and reports and guide them through the decision  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:52):**  making process, it's really nice that many of them are close enough that I can visit  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:07:56):**  semi-regularly and help them with observations that I can make directly on the land.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:02):**  Let's see, this podcast is one of the most regular things that I've been doing for six  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:07):**  years now and it's something that I go back and forth on.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:14):**  I really love having the interviews and the connections with all the wonderful people  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:18):**  who've inspired me and that I've learned from over the years.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:21):**  But also it takes a bit of time and I have some sponsors and it brings in a little bit  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:25):**  of income.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:27):**  Sometimes there are weeks where it's just like, oh goodness, I have to put out another  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:30):**  episode even if I enjoy doing the interview.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:34):**  But I'm finding new ways to keep this exciting after all this time and still make it something  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:40):**  that's challenging and fun for me.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:42):**  Let's see, I also regularly take other courses to advance my own professional skills.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:48):**  I'm in one with Water Stories right now, expanding my ability to create water designs and help  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:08:56):**  to rehydrate landscapes, something I'm really passionate about.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:01):**  And yeah, I'm also working to make more online courses and bring in people who can't necessarily  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:08):**  travel to come to courses like this one or afford to have someone dedicate their time  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:13):**  to specifically coach them on their own projects and can still find ways to access some of  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:18):**  the resources and the information that I've been able to collect through my networks.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:23):**  And all of this stuff I'm really passionate about and I'm right now as well on the cusp  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:27):**  of finally getting my own property, myself and my partner have put down payment on a  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:33):**  property that we're hoping to close the financing for this upcoming week.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:38):**  And it's been a long journey, there's been a lot of roadblocks in the process, but it  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:42):**  looks like it might finally go through.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:44):**  I'm actually even a little bit nervous to talk about this already because it's been  
**[0:09:48-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:48):**  so long in the making and so many times we thought it wasn't going to work out.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:51):**  But if we do end up going through with it, there's going to be a whole lot of content  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:09:55):**  and sharing through the process of developing that in the upcoming months.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:01):**  So that's a good summary of the main things that take up my time right now.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:06):**  Would you be willing to discuss perhaps the vision that you have for your property going  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:12):**  forward?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:13):**  Oh man, this is deep.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:15):**  So because we've had such a long journey in figuring out whether we can get the financing  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:20):**  for this place or not, I've had a lot of time to dream and to gather data and to do designs  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:26):**  and connect with people in my network to give me new ideas.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:31):**  It's a really unique property.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:33):**  The building itself is over a thousand years old, at least the core of it, and it used  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:37):**  to be a mill that's right on the edge of a river.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:39):**  If people follow my Instagram account, they've probably seen some of the videos that I've  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:43):**  put out showing the property a little bit.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:46):**  There's a lot more to come.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:48):**  And it's been added onto, it's kind of a Franken building.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:52):**  Some additions happened a couple hundred years ago.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:55):**  Some of them happened in the last couple of decades as they made expansions.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:10:58):**  It was later used as a hostel for people traveling in between two regional cities of the area  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:04):**  trading goods back before there was a highway that connected it.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:08):**  And they used to do a lot of things on the backs of donkeys, bringing their goods back  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:12):**  and forth.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:13):**  There's even some pictures of that that I've been able to uncover.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:16):**  And then it was used as a hostel and restaurant, hostel not necessarily being a youth hostel,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:22):**  but like a less formal hotel.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:24):**  So it's actually a lot bigger than what my partner and I need for our own living, but  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:29):**  we're thinking of it more as a business investment and hoping to develop it as an educational  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:34):**  center because this is the type of stuff that I'm really passionate about and so is my partner.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:39):**  And then the landscape itself is this whole other thing.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:41):**  There's three hectares altogether.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:43):**  Many of them are disconnected because the land was parceled out and redistributed among  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:48):**  family members over time.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:51):**  And the purchase kind of reconnects a number that have been discontinuous.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:11:56):**  So some of them are walking distance a little bit further away and some of them are connected.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:01):**  It's kind of a hodgepodge of different micro ecosystems.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:07):**  And of course, because there's a river that runs right through the middle, a big portion  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:11):**  is not only a floodplain, but riparian zone.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:15):**  And if anybody knows about those ecosystems, they're really important for reducing erosion.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:20):**  And there's a lot of biodiversity that happens on the edge of water bodies and the soil profiles  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:25):**  and the wildlife that comes out from those.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:29):**  And it's been damaged recently from a big flooding event that happened back in 2020.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:33):**  And so one of the things that I've been learning a lot about is to the extent that it's been  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:38):**  damaged and has been eroded along the banks and how it is naturally recovering over these  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:43):**  last two years as native vegetation grows back.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:46):**  But so does some vegetation that is considered invasive and that the area regulatory bodies  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:55):**  that are connected with the natural park that it's on the edge of are working to actively  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:12:58):**  control removing specifically Robinia, which is black locust.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:04):**  It's a common name in English, and it's a nitrogen fixing leguminous tree that grows  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:09):**  really vigorously along these types of borders.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:13):**  And yeah, it's been really cool to learn about that.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:16):**  But also the cultural context of the area, which has a really long history of not only  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:22):**  land use, but also different conquering and imperial bodies that have owned that land  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:29):**  over different periods of time.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:31):**  Starting from the Romans, who built the original structure of the mill and the bridge that  
**[0:13:37-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:37):**  is kind of the icon of the town that is connected to the house through all different wars and  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:46):**  conflicted areas that it has been a part of.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:48):**  It's changed names a few times.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:50):**  I mean, these old properties are just endless rabbit holes of information and stories.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:13:58):**  And I've had such a wonderful time uncovering this almost like a detective to learn the  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:05):**  story of this place and find how I can interact with it and be a part of its continued story  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:11):**  into the future and coax its highest potential out of the years to come.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:18):**  You recently did a Instagram post mentioning the importance of knowing your property deal  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:24):**  breakers.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:25):**  Here he is, what are your property deal breakers?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:31):**  Yeah I made a really quick post about four things that I think everyone should consider  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:35):**  before looking for property and things that are important to consider that could be deal

**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:46):**  I also mentioned as an example, if your property is within a floodplain, you should get out  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:52):**  of there.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:53):**  The land on which I'm moving to is part of a floodplain.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:14:58):**  Fortunately the house itself is very well protected from the floodplain.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:03):**  And the recent flood that came through there was a testament to that.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:06):**  It was nowhere near damaging the building.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:10):**  So that gives me some confidence.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:12):**  But I have seen some pretty harrowing video footage from the neighbor of when that flood  
**[0:15:16-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:16):**  moved through and just how much it widened and how much it eroded out the channelized  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:26):**  river body that goes through there and how much sand and sediment it deposited as it  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:31):**  receded.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:32):**  It's really wild to observe.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:35):**  I guess so deal breakers are something that are highly personal.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:39):**  Some aspects are more important to others and don't apply to the general public.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:45):**  But of course security risks are pretty universal.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:50):**  If there's a factor on your land or the property that you're considering or the house, whether  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:55):**  or not you're trying to buy land or not, that could really compromise the safety and the  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:15:59):**  security of living there, you're never going to feel at home if you're constantly nervous.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:04):**  Whether that is like a high crime rate or let's say a risk of natural disaster.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:09):**  It's in an area, which is why I gave the example of a floodplain.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:13):**  There's so many developments that are within areas that are extremely prone to natural  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:18):**  disasters and that's a poor investment over time.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:22):**  That's not going to get better as climate extremes exacerbate.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:25):**  Knowing those ahead of time and keeping them in mind even though you fall in love with  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:30):**  just how beautiful the place is and how lush the vegetation is or whatever the potential  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:34):**  you can foresee in the place might be, knowing your deal breakers is really important because  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:39):**  it can bring you back down to earth and make you make some more logical decisions that  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:43):**  will make you spend your money a little more wisely.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:46):**  But we're in southern Europe here and it's going to get hotter and drier and harsher  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:51):**  conditions for growing food.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:54):**  How does that play into your thinking about settling down here and what sort of activities  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:16:59):**  you'll be doing?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:03):**  Some areas are more susceptible to those types of risks than others.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:06):**  Where we are right now is already a pretty dry region.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:09):**  We're in the southwestern area of Catalunya near the delto de Ebra, if anybody knows this  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:17):**  region.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:19):**  It's traditionally a pretty dry area.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:20):**  I think the average is around 400 millimeters of rain per year and that can fluctuate wildly  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:27):**  by seasons.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:29):**  This is a pretty brittle climate.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:31):**  It's been susceptible to droughts and drying conditions for a long time.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:34):**  Of course, climate change is exacerbating that.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:39):**  There is a certain degree to which I feel confident that I have the skill set and the  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:42):**  competency to make the most of whatever ecology that I move into.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:48):**  But I also considered that significantly when I was looking at assessing properties with  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:53):**  my partner.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:17:55):**  And considering that it is so close to a Mediterranean climate, it is actually part of a more maritime  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:02):**  climate because it is at a higher elevation in a densely wooded area in a low mountain  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:08):**  range in central eastern Catalunya.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:15):**  It's in a little pocket of a valley, which makes sense because there's a river running  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:18):**  right through it in the mountains.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:20):**  Being in a lowlands, it is susceptible to some very cold temperatures that the rest  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:25):**  of Catalunya mostly doesn't experience.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:27):**  Getting down to minus 10 last year I observed, and I've heard even as low as minus 19 one  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:33):**  time, which is not insignificant.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:36):**  Even last year I saw a portion of the waterfall that is right next to the house freeze solid.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:42):**  That will put a little respect in you.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:47):**  I've seen the degraded pasture and the floodplain all covered in frost.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:53):**  Because it's in this low area, the sun doesn't hit it for a long time.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:18:59):**  Closer into the north side of the mountains on the opposite end of the river, keeps it  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:05):**  shaded throughout much of the day and the sun goes down pretty early in the winter time  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:10):**  too.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:11):**  You start to lose direct sunlight around 3 or 3.30 in the afternoon already.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:17):**  That makes it even colder than it would be if you were just further up the south side  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:23):**  of the mountain on the opposite end.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:26):**  It's definitely a little microclimate and it's something that I need to make design  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:29):**  decisions and planting choices to accommodate because it's not something that I can change.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:36):**  However, one thing that it does have is a lot of water.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:41):**  In an area that is quickly drying out and the hydrology has been mismanaged for a long  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:45):**  time, yes of course there are things that you can do to capture water and retain water  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:50):**  on the landscape but it's also pretty nice if there's two mountain springs that feed  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:57):**  directly to the house.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:19:59):**  That's some redundancy that is hard to beat to say nothing of the year long river that  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:03):**  runs right in front of the property.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:05):**  Worst case scenario, we lose power or something and I have to go down to the river and bring  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:11):**  it by buckets.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:13):**  There are people who have to do that and walk miles or kilometers to the nearest water source.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:17):**  I can drop a bucket from our porch and hit water in the river in front.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:24):**  That's a piece of security that I definitely valued when we were looking at the property.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:29):**  So it sounds like your property and your property's microclimate are pretty set.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:35):**  You have a lot of water.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:37):**  For the wider region, what do you want to see or what sort of collaborations do you  
**[0:20:42-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:42):**  think would make the whole region more resilient to climate change?  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:51):**  This is tricky because there's a lot of diversity even in a small section of Spain as Catalunya  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:58):**  is.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:20:59):**  There's a wide diversity of geology, everything from the high Pyrenees up in the northwest  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:05):**  and the coastal area all along the southeastern coast and a whole lot of things in between.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:12):**  There's plains kind of in the western central area.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:16):**  There's three mountain ranges including the coastal area and the Costa Brava on the northeast  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:21):**  side.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:22):**  The central mountains are the prelatorial range of which our new house is going to be  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:26):**  nestled in and then of course you get into the Pyrenees there too.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:30):**  So Catalunya is not one thing and each one of those ecosystems and geologies needs to  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:36):**  be managed according to the most appropriate way to coax higher capacity of life for each  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:42):**  of those.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:44):**  So they need to be kind of looked at as different bioregions and different strategies applied  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:48):**  to each of them.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:49):**  Now here where we are in Miravet at the Green Rebel Farm for this course, we are not at  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:21:55):**  high elevation but you can see mountains around us and we're quite up above the coast for  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:00):**  sure.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:01):**  I can't remember the exact elevation here.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:02):**  We've got it written down somewhere else.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:04):**  It's 250?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:05):**  Yeah that sounds about right.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:09):**  And so like sea level rise is not an issue here.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:12):**  However in Barcelona it definitely is and there need to be appropriate reactions and  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:18):**  planning for each of those things.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:23):**  Soils are poor and highly alkaline because there's a lot of limestone in this area and  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:29):**  they've been depleted for a really long time because of intensive management for hundreds  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:33):**  if not thousands of years.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:35):**  And so that just needs to be taken into account.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:38):**  There's a lot of rebuilding that needs to be done before we can even talk about regeneration.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:42):**  We need to get back to zero.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:44):**  This place has been extorted for a really long time.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:47):**  And I and from the experience that I've built up tend to start at a watershed level and  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:22:58):**  work on the hydrology of the landscape because water is the life force that makes everything  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:03):**  else possible.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:04):**  And if you can hold water in the landscape and even out its distribution throughout the  
**[0:23:08-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:08):**  dry seasons in these intense climates then all sorts of new opportunities arise.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:16):**  From there you can assess those opportunities, look into either planting woody perennials,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:21):**  things that can withstand the droughts and some of the changes that are already on the  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:28):**  way.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:29):**  But that's how I look at it first.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:32):**  Those are the positive actions that can be done to start to reestablish the capacity  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:37):**  for life in this region.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:39):**  There's also another way to look at it which is the current practices that are actively  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:43):**  degrading the land and which of those we should stop right away.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:47):**  The obvious one is the constant tillage of topsoil.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:52):**  You see it everywhere around here.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:53):**  In fact this little farm, even though it is still quite degraded and has only been managed  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:23:58):**  for a little while, already shows signs of life that the neighboring properties literally  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:03):**  like across a small little footpath look like moonscapes with some trees in them.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:10):**  They're tilled to death and it's all exposed dusty soil that with the slightest breeze  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:15):**  starts to go up into the atmosphere and goodness knows when it starts to rain it just sheers  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:20):**  off the top and ends up in the waterways.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:23):**  That would be a good thing to stop doing, especially if we want to continue to hold  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:27):**  water on the landscape and rehydrate this area, revegetate it.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:33):**  At a certain point we're just talking about damage control and yet it's still a very common  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:37):**  practice that is common and culturally appropriate by the industrial forces that continue to  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:45):**  incentivize the mass production of commodity crops and monoculture cultivation of those.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:53):**  So it's tricky.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:24:54):**  It needs to be looked at at a systemic level because if we just tell people immediately  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:00):**  you can't till your fields anymore, they don't necessarily have either the educational or  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:07):**  the financial resources to make big management changes overnight.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:12):**  As much as this is a long-term damaging practice, there are real reasons for why they do this  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:17):**  and not all of them are based on sound science but if you've done this your entire time and  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:23):**  this is the only way you really understand about how to manage the land that you perhaps  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:27):**  inherited or invested in, it doesn't just shift overnight and I have a lot of compassion  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:31):**  for that because farmers, land managers in general are often hanging by a thread economically  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:37):**  and are really stressed to keep this viable and to provide for their families and if you  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:42):**  come from sort of a top-down effort at controlling what they do and forcing their hand into things,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:48):**  it's only going to breed resentment.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:50):**  It's not going to result in an embracing of new practices.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:55):**  So it's not easy.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:25:57):**  I have a lot of respect for the necessary nuances and changes to make this happen at  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:02):**  a systemic level.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:05):**  During the course that we had that we discussed the holistic approach, we experienced that  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:11):**  it's like a momentum at this moment.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:17):**  We just talked a little about your actual new program project.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:23):**  I'm wondering how you envision yourself in 20 years.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:28):**  So what are you doing at that moment or what do you envision there?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:33):**  20 years is really hard for me to think of in that terms.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:38):**  I know how much I have changed and have changed my mind and priorities in the previous 20  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:43):**  years.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:44):**  I can only imagine what type of person I'm going to be in the next 20.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:48):**  Gosh, I would hope that I'm still with the same partner that I have and the same land  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:26:55):**  that we're just about to move on to and that my family is all well, but if those circumstances  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:02):**  change it's very hard to see in that kind of time scale.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:08):**  So I guess this is more of a question about hope because it's very difficult to plan anything  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:13):**  concretely given the variables that can come up in those time frames.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:17):**  I would hope that I'm spending as much time as possible with my family, maybe even having  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:23):**  them moved on to the property with me.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:27):**  Who knows, maybe my folks would embrace the idea of retiring to this property with us  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:33):**  and joining us in that journey.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:37):**  It's unlikely that my brothers and sisters would do that.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:41):**  They have very active and demanding lives in their respective countries where they live.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:46):**  My three brothers are still in the States, my sister and her husband are in Kuwait with  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:50):**  their daughters.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:52):**  One of the motivations for getting a larger property than my partner and I need for ourselves  
**[0:27:56-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:27:56):**  is that my sister voiced the interest in coming and spending all of their vacations with us.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:04):**  I would hope that that's something that continues.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:06):**  I mean, goodness, in 20 years her youngest daughter will be 21, so I don't know that  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:11):**  she's going to want to come and hang out with her old uncle and his goofy farm in 20 years,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:17):**  but how cool would that be if she did?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:22):**  Very different lives by then.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:24):**  And I mean, goodness knows if the same economic structures and travel infrastructure will  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:29):**  still exist or not, that will definitely dictate the possibilities.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:33):**  But I mean, who knows if what I'm thinking about doing and implementing on the lands  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:40):**  comes to fruition, it'll be quite mature in 20 years.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:43):**  Like a dense agroforestry system could be a beautiful example of what is possible in  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:50):**  those sandy acidic soils that I'm going to be managing as dense as the forest is around  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:56):**  it.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:28:57):**  And hopefully I'll have had some positive impact on that watershed and care for the  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:04):**  riparian zone of that river, keeping it clean and clear, improving the biodiversity, making  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:09):**  it more resilient by vegetating that space.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:13):**  And gosh, one of my biggest hopes is that I will have formed much closer bonds with  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:18):**  that community and be an integral part of the support network there that people could  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:23):**  rely on me.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:25):**  And goodness knows, I hope that my Catalan gets up to speed in 20 years.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:30):**  I got to start taking more active classes.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:33):**  It's one of my biggest challenges because I speak Spanish, but Catalan is the next hurdle.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:38):**  It's a region of Spain that is very proud of their cultural heritage and very protective  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:44):**  of their language.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:45):**  And I really respect that.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:46):**  And I hope to adequately assimilate into that community.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:52):**  Perfect.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:53):**  Thank you.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:29:55):**  Do you have anything or any vision perhaps of what you would most like to achieve professionally  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:01):**  in your life?

**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:05):**  That's a tricky one because I'm still in denial that I have to work and have a job  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:13):**  to get through all of this.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:14):**  I'm doing my best not to.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:17):**  Like if I really had it my way, like, okay, so put it this way.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:20):**  If I am professionally successful, what time frame am I looking at here?  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:24):**  Do I get 20 years again?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:25):**  10 years.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:26):**  10 years.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:27):**  Oh, I better get to work.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:28):**  What does success in 10 years time look like?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:33):**  Success in 10 years, man.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:35):**  Professionally.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:36):**  Professionally.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:37):**  Okay, professionally.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:38):**  Because I was going to say something totally different.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:43):**  Professionally.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:44):**  That the idea that I have for creating this property into, I don't want to say a demonstration  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:50):**  site because I'm not trying to get people to copy what I do, but maybe disseminate some  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:30:57):**  cool ideas that people can build upon and adapt to their own context.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:02):**  I hope that our place becomes a welcoming space for learning and innovation in this  
**[0:31:11-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:11):**  very broad concept of regeneration and that I can continue to welcome incredible minds  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:20):**  who are advancing this in ways that I can only conceptually understand because there's  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:25):**  opportunities here for advancing it in the political sphere, in the community organizing  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:30):**  sphere, in the child education sphere, and on and on and on and none of these things  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:34):**  do I have any competency or specialization in.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:37):**  But if that could be something that is an economic driver that at least pays my mortgage  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:43):**  so I don't have to do a bunch of things that I don't really enjoy, that would be awesome.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:51):**  And that a lot of us could flourish from that effort.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:31:54):**  I hope that it's not revolving around or dependent on me for it to succeed because I don't want  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:00):**  the responsibility of potentially being that bottleneck that things can't move past but  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:05):**  rather that it's open and people can bring their skills, their knowledge, their inspiration  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:10):**  through there and that there's at least enough economic flow rather than sequestration like  
**[0:32:17-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:17):**  you know hoarding that a lot of people can benefit and I can comfortably and safely pay  
**[0:32:24-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:24):**  at least my necessary bills while I increasingly spend my time looking after animals and tending  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:34):**  to my garden and taking care of my trees but mostly in the larger effort of providing for  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:40):**  my family and my community.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:44):**  It's not so much tethered to doing certain projects or getting a certain amount of clients  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:51):**  or certainly not earning a certain amount but not having to worry economically I think  
**[0:32:56-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:32:56):**  is at the core of economic success to me rather than this idea of success or abundance monetarily.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:04):**  Just not having to stress about it would be nice.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:09):**  In terms of the work you're doing at present or perhaps life in general what would you  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:15):**  like more of and in turn what would you like there to be less of in terms of how you spend  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:20):**  your time?  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:22):**  Less Zoom calls.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:24):**  Gosh there's too many of those these days because the company that I work with as much  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:28):**  as I really love the people that I work with and I genuinely feel motivated to do the work  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:35):**  and to help to connect people in the regenerative ag space around Europe.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:42):**  It's a poor substitute for interacting with people in real life and so I guess the flip  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:47):**  side of that is that I get to do more events like this where people like you who are interested  
**[0:33:53-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:33:53):**  in the topics that I talk about and teach about are drawn to come and participate and  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:01):**  co-create beautiful projects and incredible designs and share your own knowledge and expertise  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:08):**  with me which helps to expand my own perspective on this concept.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:13):**  I really do derive satisfaction and energy from the personal interactions.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:21):**  Sometimes I get a little bit burnt out when there's a lot of people and I need to retreat  
**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:25):**  and recharge a little bit by myself but I really love the more intimate conversations,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:32):**  getting to know people on a deeper level and connect over some of these ideas and concepts  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:37):**  that we've been exploring on this course and seeing especially what you guys do with it  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:42):**  and how you interpret this information and what you eventually end up doing with it in  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:47):**  the real world later on.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:49):**  I would love to have an increasing amount of that in my future.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:54):**  So a lot of your listeners are in cities I guess.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:34:59):**  How can you be regenerative in a city?  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:02):**  Well first of all you have to kind of assume that anybody as an individual can be regenerative  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:08):**  on their own which I do not assume.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:12):**  It's all about the interactions and the connections within a larger system that is the thing that  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:21):**  I would encourage people to strive for.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:23):**  I'm not so much an advocate of like oh I'm going to go off and be self-sufficient in  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:29):**  this far off rural area and I'm going to forget the rest of society and I'm going to make  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:34):**  this work for me and it's not realistic and a lot of people have tried it and found it  
**[0:35:39-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:39):**  unfulfilling because we derive, almost all of us, our value as being important members  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:47):**  of a larger collective whether that community is connected because of physical proximity  
**[0:35:53-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:35:53):**  like in a small town or connected over a shared vision as is often the case in let's say educational  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:01):**  or even theological communities that unite people via religion or scientific theories  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:09):**  or belief systems.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:11):**  It's all beautiful and people really derive, especially myself, personal value and meaning  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:17):**  from playing an important role in advancing a concept that's larger than my own individual  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:22):**  efforts.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:24):**  Cities offer a unique opportunity for that because there's just so many people that you  
**[0:36:27-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:27):**  could potentially collaborate with and access and co-create with in a small space.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:35):**  It's the reason why there's so much innovation and invention and progress that come from  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:40):**  these areas because you're forced to find ways to interact with, tolerate and flourish  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:45):**  with people with very different cultural backgrounds and languages.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:50):**  Cities have always been melting pots of ideas and progress.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:36:54):**  I think there are unique potential in cities that only in the modern context have really  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:00):**  become accessible and if we look at it as an individual what can I do myself to make  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:07):**  my own life regenerative, we're missing the bigger potential which really comes from the  
**[0:37:13-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:13):**  collaborative energies and ideas that are possible in those types of larger communities.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:21):**  At the same time, don't get me wrong, I've lived in cities, really big cities like Manila  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:25):**  in the past and I feel overwhelmed and I often feel extremely lonely being around so many  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:31):**  people with so little connection and intimacy and so I sympathize with that kind of burnout  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:37):**  and feeling that this is not an environment in which I can really connect.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:41):**  I've chosen a different path for my life but we're at a point where we're getting on like  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:46):**  60 maybe even 70% of the world's population is going to be living in urban and suburban  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:51):**  centers within the next 30-50 years and so we need to look for opportunities to create  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:37:56):**  more meaningful connections rather than disconnection.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:00):**  The disconnection that is so easy to fall into when you just become an anonymous face

**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:09):**  I don't claim to have solutions for that but I do encourage people to start really small  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:15):**  because when you try and take on things at scale before stress testing them about how  
**[0:38:19-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:19):**  they work out on a smaller, much more manageable and much more safe to fail scale, it's overwhelming  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:28):**  and it's setting expectations that are almost guaranteeing your disappointment or failure.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:35):**  So I mean how many people in cities know their neighbors?  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:39):**  Do you know the person who lives on the apartment block right next to you?  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:45):**  Yeah I'm getting nods for no and like I live in an apartment right now.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:49):**  I know some of my neighbors.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:50):**  I do not spend a lot of time with them.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:52):**  I don't feel good about that but I'm also in the process of moving so I make excuses  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:38:56):**  which are not really justifiable for not making better efforts at getting to know them and  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:39:01):**  by this point it's kind of too late so I screwed up.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:39:04):**  I'll have to do better next time.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:39:06):**  But it's those little steps of making a connection to the people who live next to you.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:39:12):**  Would you prefer to in an emergency situation always rely on 911 or emergency services with

**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:39:31):**  I would prefer to rely on that at least you know in any capacity that you could.

**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:39:46):**  with people who are within proximity and I would really put my efforts into starting  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:39:50):**  there rather than thinking like oh how can this city become regenerative?  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:39:54):**  Goodness I don't know what to tell you but start with your apartment block.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:00):**  Start with your neighborhood.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:01):**  Start with your school or your kids school or you know something manageable and you're

**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:11):**  to make those connections.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:12):**  That's where I would start.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:14):**  I'm curious who or what do you consider to have been your biggest influences along your  
**[0:40:20-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:20):**  journey and perhaps also who has been a notable mentor to you and how did you go about acquiring  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:29):**  those mentors?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:30):**  Oh this is a lovely question because this gives me the opportunity to express my deep  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:37):**  gratitude for some people who have been really influential to me and there's no way I would  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:42):**  be in a position that I am now or at least the parts that I'm proud of without the assistance  
**[0:40:48-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:48):**  from these people.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:49):**  So number one is my sister.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:52):**  My sister is my best friend and though she is younger than me she has had an outsized  
**[0:40:58-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:40:58):**  influence on my mental and spiritual type of growth and my growth as a more mature person  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:06):**  because she is way more smart and mature than I am and has helped to push me into growing  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:12):**  up a little bit more and being a more compassionate person and I'm so grateful for having that  
**[0:41:18-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:18):**  kind of guidance and deep friendship that can only come from a sibling relationship.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:26):**  And certainly my brothers as well even though we haven't been as close in the past years  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:31):**  I consider myself a decently well-traveled, well-read and fairly interesting person and  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:38):**  I also consider myself to be the least interesting member of my family and they're constantly  
**[0:41:43-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:43):**  pushing me to try harder, be better and follow some of their incredible examples.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:51):**  Some of them have children, some of them don't but they have always been an example for me  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:41:55):**  even though they're all younger than me as how I could grow and that's just a deep personal

**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:02):**  If we're talking professionally I would say one of my closest mentors especially in the  
**[0:42:06-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:06):**  last handful of years is a guy named Charlie Rendell and he is just a wonderful, compassionate,  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:14):**  incredibly talented and dedicated person who was my mentor into bamboo building in Guatemala.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:21):**  He was the reason why I stayed there for a long time initially and his mentorship initially  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:29):**  was my interest in learning a new building technique and material that I could use and  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:34):**  very quickly evolved into something much deeper.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:37):**  He became a very close friend.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:40):**  I ended up living on the compound that he had built out of natural materials with his  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:44):**  partner over a bunch of years and it was a beautiful experience.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:49):**  But one of the main things that I learned from him is how as an outsider with quite  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:42:57):**  an amount of privilege, he was very well educated and come from a well-to-do family in London,  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:03):**  went to King's College in London and had all kinds of opportunities to work in companies  
**[0:43:08-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:08):**  and do well economically and succeed by traditional standards, decided to put most of his efforts  
**[0:43:17-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:17):**  into building up his local community in a rural village in indigenous Guatemala.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:24):**  And the one thing that I will tell people that is the closest thing to a shortcut to  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:29):**  how much his presence and his mentorship to the people who worked with him was, is that  
**[0:43:35-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:35):**  he had not one, not two, nor three, but four of his workers name their kids after him.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:44):**  That will give you a bit of perspective as to what he meant to his community.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:49):**  That's not a small thing and people don't just do that because it's a show of respect.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:43:57):**  He went the extra mile to invest in those people's lives, in their professional development.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:04):**  Many of them have gone on to work for other companies and have earning potential that  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:09):**  they never had in that town before.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:12):**  They didn't get formal educations, he trained them and gave them skills that some of them  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:18):**  still work for him now as subcontractors rather than employees and have their own small businesses  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:23):**  and others have graduated on to professional skills with other companies, completely surpassing  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:29):**  what their trajectory was before he took an interest and invested in them.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:35):**  I'm always going to miss out some people because I have had the privilege of learning from  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:40):**  so many wonderful people.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:44):**  It's late at night and I'm two drinks in so I'm a little fuzzy on names, but Carol Cruz,  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:53):**  one of my mentors in natural plasters and finishes when I was doing my apprenticeship  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:44:58):**  through the cottage company.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:03):**  So many of the people that I've learned from and have later become friends from the podcast  
**[0:45:08-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:08):**  itself, Darren Dougherty has been a real mentor of mine and a real influence on not just professional  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:15):**  level ability to do this kind of work but just a genuinely nice guy that you would want  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:21):**  to be around.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:22):**  Who else?  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:23):**  Some of my co-workers and close friends, I mean this is going to end up sounding like  
**[0:45:27-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:27):**  an Oscar speech so start playing the music, but I'm very very grateful and all of the  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:35):**  good qualities of me are a product of good teaching and people who have taken an interest  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:40):**  and coaxed me along the way.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:44):**  Mentorship is extremely powerful and valuable in life and if you're looking to advance or  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:49):**  grow as a person I highly recommend that you make the effort to find a mentorship in your  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:55):**  life.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:45:56):**  Do you have any advice to people who perhaps are feeling like they don't have mentorship,  
**[0:46:03-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:03):**  how they might go about finding this?  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:07):**  I don't know if there's like a process or a path that I can recommend.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:12):**  My mentors have come to me both in formal pursuits like Carol Cruz was a part of my  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:18):**  apprenticeship that I paid money for to learn about natural building and it was one of the  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:22):**  steps along that journey and others came out from reaching out directly to people that  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:29):**  I admired and asking if I could study with them or learn with them and then that sometimes  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:35):**  I learned that like oh this person has a lot of skills and knowledge but I don't care to  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:39):**  be around them, our personalities don't mix and others have been like oh wow this person  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:45):**  not only is an incredible practitioner or builder or teacher or whatever but we have  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:51):**  a deep connection as friends and I really admire them as a person.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:54):**  It's usually those that have blossomed into longer term mentorships because there's been  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:46:59):**  a deeper connection and things that we care about that bring us together in life beyond  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:03):**  just professional pursuits.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:07):**  So be open, ask questions, don't be afraid to reach out to people that you admire and  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:12):**  flattery will get you a long way.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:14):**  Let them know that you appreciate what they do and that you admire some aspect of something  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:19):**  that you've observed and people are pretty good about opening up to that and it's a good  
**[0:47:25-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:25):**  doorway into building deeper relationships.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:29):**  Great.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:30):**  Okay I have a question, let me just read.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:37):**  Okay so this was potentially going to be a closing question, there might be more to come  
**[0:47:41-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:41):**  but what do you wish, excuse me, what do you wish more people knew about permaculture,  
**[0:47:53-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:47:53):**  regenerative practices or maybe like, yeah what do you, yeah like I'm thinking for example  
**[0:48:01-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:01):**  like what you were saying about like trees being like there's no excuse not to have trees  
**[0:48:11-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:11):**  like trees are free, we can graph trees.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:13):**  Yeah yeah yeah okay I think I know what you're getting at here so one of the things that  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:18):**  I talk about not only in these courses but on the podcast and basically anywhere that  
**[0:48:22-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:22):**  people will listen to me is that I truly believe in the potential for every single person on  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:29):**  earth to interact with the natural world in a beneficial way and there are a lot of cultural  
**[0:48:35-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:35):**  narratives and societal narratives right now that make us think that the best thing that  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:39):**  we could possibly do is to reduce our consumption and our impact on the world which hides an  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:46):**  implication that our only potential is to be a damaging force here and I don't believe  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:51):**  that at all, I've seen too many examples to the contrary and as I've learned more about  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:48:55):**  how to understand and read landscapes I've begun to recognize how easy it is to start  
**[0:49:02-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:02):**  on a path of stewardship and positive interaction with the natural world and what I'm hoping  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:10):**  to communicate through avenues like this podcast and through workshops like this and hopefully  
**[0:49:16-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:16):**  through other means in the future is that you don't need an expensive or long-term degree  
**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:23):**  and specialized education to be able to do this stuff.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:27):**  You don't need expensive equipment, you don't need a ton of experience, you can start with  
**[0:49:31-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:31):**  the smallest little steps anytime you want.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:34):**  People talk about oh I can't start producing my own food because I don't have any land  
**[0:49:39-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:39):**  and grow sprouts in your kitchen, grow microgreens in a recycled tray of plastic that the meat  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:47):**  you bought came in.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:48):**  This is exactly what I did over the pandemic.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:50):**  It's like I just had a bunch of scrap stuff and some earth that I gathered from outside  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:54):**  and all right it's not going to keep you alive, it's not going to provide the calories that  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:49:58):**  you need but every little step of something that you don't have to outsource to a destructive  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:04):**  industry is one more thing that you get to take control of and that people can't sell  
**[0:50:09-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:09):**  to you because you're capable of providing it yourself.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:13):**  The hot thing right now is producing your own food, that's great, it will always be  
**[0:50:17-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:17):**  relevant but even if that's not your passion, source natural fibers and make your own clothes  
**[0:50:25-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:25):**  or forgo professional therapy if you can and build deep relationships with family members  
**[0:50:34-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:34):**  and friends that can lend an ear and help to counsel you so that hopefully you don't  
**[0:50:40-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:40):**  have to outsource it too much.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:42):**  There's just so many ways to provide the deep quality things that are often offered to us  
**[0:50:47-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:47):**  as surrogates that are sold in services that are devoid of the real quality that we're  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:56):**  looking for.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:50:57):**  I think I gave an example earlier today of like back when we used to live with older  
**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:02):**  generations grandma didn't only cook and clean in the house she was also a source of wisdom  
**[0:51:08-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:08):**  and guidance and helped you make decisions and could look after the children not only  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:14):**  as a babysitter or child care that you would otherwise hire out but someone with a vested  
**[0:51:19-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:19):**  interest and love for the kid that they're looking after and deep care for how they're  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:26):**  grown and how they're brought up.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:28):**  You can't pay somebody to care like that, it can only come from the development of mutually  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:34):**  beneficial relationships in which people are equally invested in the well-being and the  
**[0:51:39-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:39):**  outcome of the other people they interact with and when we're missing those we will  
**[0:51:45-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:45):**  look for them in ways that are cheap substitutes that we have to pay for every little thing  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:53):**  that a healthy community and healthy relationships in our lives used to provide for us which  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:51:59):**  means we have to spend more and more of our time most of us doing things that we don't  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:04):**  particularly like in order to pay for all the stuff that we lost and it was always free  
**[0:52:10-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:10):**  to get it back but it takes time it takes care and you can't buy that stuff and I am  
**[0:52:19-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:19):**  so interested in finding ways for everybody to do their little part even if it seems insignificant  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:27):**  and it's not going to solve climate change or it's not going to you know take down the  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:31):**  oppressive regime whatever the big existential problem we're grappling with is right now.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:36):**  Every one of these little efforts towards building higher quality connections whether  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:42):**  that's with the natural world whether it's with your neighbors whether it's with your  
**[0:52:46-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:46):**  own kids I don't care like all of this is worthwhile and collectively it amasses to  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:52):**  something really meaningful that could that could change the trajectory that our society  
**[0:52:55-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:55):**  is on.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:52:56):**  Is that a good ending question?  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:01):**  Alright well this was really fun like I said nobody ever interviews me like this and it's  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:07):**  been a long time since I've considered and articulated the answers to some of these questions  
**[0:53:11-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:11):**  so not only thank you guys for indulging me this is super fun but thank you for being

**[0:53:24-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:24):**  we're making real connections and friendships that may have started from listening to this  
**[0:53:29-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:29):**  podcast from a distance or seeing something that I posted online but we're doing real  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:35):**  work because of this and this is what I see as the potential for putting out content and  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:40):**  you know sometimes it's just an exercise in ego but sometimes it results in people coming  
**[0:53:45-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:45):**  from different parts of the world together to plant trees on a little farm that has high  
**[0:53:50-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ask-me-anything-students-from-the-regen-design-course-interview-me/#t=0:53:50):**  ambitions and little budget you know that's that's this is exactly what I'm hoping that

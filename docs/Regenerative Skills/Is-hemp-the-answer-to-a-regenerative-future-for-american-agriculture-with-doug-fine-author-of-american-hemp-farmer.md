### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 08:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:41):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:14):**  Every Monday, to get your week started off right, I'll send you a new regenerative  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:18):**  skill that you can develop and expand on in your own life right away.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:22):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:26):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:31):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:36):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:41):**  I've been meaning to get in touch with someone who could explain to me the nebulous and exploding  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:46):**  new farming industry around the ancient yet newly legalized hemp plant, and I found a  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:51):**  goldmine of information in Doug Fine, the author of Hempbound and American Hemp Farmer.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:01:57):**  Now Doug is known as a solar-powered goat herder, comedic investigative journalist,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:02):**  and pioneer voice in the cannabis hemp and regenerative farming worlds.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:07):**  He has grown hemp in four US states and the genetics he's developed are in five more.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:12):**  He's an award-winning culture and climate correspondent for NPR, the New York Times,  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:17):**  and the Washington Post, among other publications.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:21):**  In this interview, Doug shares the moment that he calls his climate Pearl Harbor, which  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:26):**  set his life on a new trajectory.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:29):**  He breaks down the complicated history of hemp cultivation around the world and in the  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:33):**  United States.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:34):**  We also unpack the gold rush on hemp products, especially CBD oils, and Doug explains his  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:40):**  caution around the potential for a boom and bust cycle that could be terrible for the  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:44):**  industry at large if not managed correctly.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:48):**  He also outlines his thoughts on a healthy and regenerative industry for hemp, not only  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:53):**  for the land but for all of the yet undiscovered and unstudied properties of this amazing plant  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:02:58):**  to say nothing of all the useful byproducts in the stalks and fibers.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:03):**  I personally learned a ton from this chat and I'm really looking forward to watching  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:07):**  this budding industry find its roots, so to speak, and am hopeful for a bright future  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:12):**  for the hemp market.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:14):**  So now I'll turn things over to Doug.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:16):**  Hey Doug, thanks so much for making time to be on the podcast with me today.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:19):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:20):**  Oh, I'm feeling really blissful here.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:23):**  It's hemp planting season here in the South of the United States.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:27):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:28):**  Yeah, what an exciting time of year.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:29):**  There's so much potential up ahead for a new year, even in the middle of this crisis.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:33):**  Tell me a little bit about how you and your family have been doing in all of these crazy  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:38):**  current events.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:40):**  Acknowledging that there's genuine suffering and that's something that I and my family  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:47):**  care about, our lives are very unaffected.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:51):**  We made the decision to live very remote and try to generate as much of our lives and food  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:03:59):**  and energy and entertainment on our remote ranch as we can decades ago.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:06):**  So the truth is, depending on the amount of news that we pay attention to, our lives have  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:14):**  hardly changed at all.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:15):**  Man, well, way to be ahead of the curve on that.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:19):**  I think a lot of people are considering those transitions right now.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:22):**  But look, let's jump into your specific area of expertise, although I'm sure you have others,  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:30):**  and your new book, The American Hemp Farmer.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:33):**  Can you start first by telling me a little bit about your background and how you got  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:38):**  into the American hemp industry?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:40):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:41):**  Thanks for asking and for having me on.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:43):**  I grew up in the suburbs back when Madonna was like a virgin, New York suburbs.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:49):**  And so that, you know, I very lucky upbringing, you know, on food and not threatened by war  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:55):**  and loved and all that good stuff.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:04:57):**  So but there was some feel quite right about the disconnect of, you know, mall life and  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:06):**  processed food.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:07):**  I couldn't put my finger on it.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:09):**  We took family vacations to national parks, which probably was very good.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:13):**  And I recognize that I was an animal in the ecosystem, such as it was.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:17):**  So I lived for years in places like Alaska, where I learned to subsistence salmon, fish  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:23):**  and berry pick and all that good stuff.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:26):**  So I became a member of the animal kingdom again, and then I'm headed to us to new remote,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:32):**  funky butte ranch in New Mexico and try to live with modern comforts, but without petroleum  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:38):**  or with much reduced petroleum wrote a book about that called Farewell my Subaru, and  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:43):**  things like milking goats for reducing carbon miles and dairy and solar powering the house,  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:49):**  the ranch house.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:51):**  During that time, my closest neighbor who I don't know if you'd actually say he's in  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:05:56):**  shouting distance, but technically my closest was the subject of a ridiculous taxpayer funded  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:02):**  raid.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:03):**  He was a corporate retiree self medicating from military service on one of humanity's  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:07):**  longest plants cannabis.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:10):**  Today he's perfectly legal.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:12):**  But at that time, it was this crazy raid that put my family in danger of planes, helicopters,  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:17):**  machine gun guys with earpieces all over the place.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:22):**  It spurred me I've always been or I've long been a fan of the of the cannabis plant and  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:27):**  many plants and herbs but spurred me to do some research about what it would be like  
**[0:06:32-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:32):**  if America's worst policy since segregation, which is the war in cannabis, word and words  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:39):**  rather than sort of just saying, Hey, here's this terrible war and drugs.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:41):**  What about what does it look like when it's over?  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:43):**  So before the league first wave of legalizations in the States, I went in a year with my family  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:49):**  with cannabis regenerative psychoactive cannabis growers, nonprofit folks in Northern California  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:06:56):**  where a famous growing region where cannabis had been locally legalized prior to federal  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:04):**  state and federal legalization of any kind.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:07):**  So that was called too high to fail.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:10):**  And while I was there, those producers, those farmers were saying, Hey, we only use the  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:14):**  flower.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:15):**  What about the rest of the plant?  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:17):**  That spurred me to spend a year searching Well, what about the rest of the plant and  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:20):**  I wrote a book came out on 420 2014 called hemp bound.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:25):**  And it is a high altitude, everything that hemp can do from providing energy to regenerating  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:32):**  soil and reviving small farming economies.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:36):**  And then boom, right about the month that book came out hemp was federally first step  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:41):**  of federally was removed from the controlled substances act if you were technically a research  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:45):**  project.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:46):**  So real farmers were really planting.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:50):**  And I wrote a hemp printed monograph about those first farmers called first legal harvest  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:07:56):**  the year after came out using some of the hemp that those first farmers grew in printing  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:01):**  the monograph alongside my friends at tree free hemp who helped publish it.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:06):**  And then I spent several years now we're really doing it.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:09):**  What about a practical guy?  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:11):**  That's what people reading hemp bound and first legal harvest asked.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:13):**  They said, wow, okay, you got us going.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:16):**  How do we do it?  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:17):**  So this book I've written now American hemp farmer, it's really could be titled worldwide  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:21):**  hemp farmer.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:22):**  It's a farmer a regenerative independent farmer entrepreneur focus.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:27):**  The themes are this time the farmers are in charge gold rushes only matter if instead  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:33):**  of three cents on the retail farm dollar farmers are getting a hundred cents less, less expenses.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:40):**  So it's really looking at that from a perspective of making a living for your family, reviving  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:44):**  farm communities and helping save carbon sequestration.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:49):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:50):**  And you know, this journey that you've gone through in investigating and talking with  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:08:56):**  the people who have been in this fight since, you know, it was very dangerous and how does  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:02):**  it make you feel to live through this transition where it's going through an absolute renaissance  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:07):**  right now and seeing all the potential just kind of flood into the market all at once.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:12):**  It must be incredibly exciting.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:14):**  Oliver, it makes me feel very, very lucky.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:18):**  I can't predict the chaos element.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:21):**  And none of us can predict the chaos element in probability and physics that a topic that's  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:28):**  important to you and me and your listeners that suddenly it's really number one economic  
**[0:09:35-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:35):**  story of the last 20 years and probably the next 50 years at least the return of cannabis  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:43):**  hemp to the above ground.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:44):**  And the number one spearhead of a larger return to a biomaterials economy that can really  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:49):**  help humanity survive post petroleum, not just survive, but thrive.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:09:54):**  It's astounding to have stumbled upon, you know, maybe slightly ahead of the curve, a  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:04):**  phenomenon, a plant based biomaterials based solution for humanity.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:09):**  It's overwhelming to think about it.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:11):**  And it's something that I can't overanalyze because I didn't have my all I did was say  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:17):**  this is this is an important plant.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:19):**  I'd like to read.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:20):**  I'd like to spend some time a journalist is what I do.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:23):**  You know, I was already 1015 years into my career when I started really studying cannabis  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:28):**  hemp plants and plants in general, by the way, one of the things these last 510 years  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:32):**  of research have done really in my eyes about plant intelligence.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:37):**  For many people, they're sort of totemic relationships are with plants.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:41):**  So what I'm saying here won't surprise them.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:43):**  But for me, been sort of the goat whisperer in my family, the one who could always come  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:48):**  the skittish nanny goat on the milk stand if she was acting up.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:10:54):**  And then now seeing the arguably slower pace, but just the immense intelligence of all plants,  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:02):**  not just cannabis hemp.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:04):**  It's a fun development in my life.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:07):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:08):**  So look, let's, let's go back to putting your journalist hat back on and talk a little bit  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:12):**  about the history of the hemp industry in the United States, because I mean, it wasn't  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:17):**  always illegal, and it played a major role in shaping the country, right?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:21):**  It did.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:23):**  But humanity, the 77 years of cannabis prohibition in the US, were blink a blip in humanities  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:31):**  a thousand year relationship with the plant.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:35):**  Anthropologists call cannabis hemp, a camp follower, before we made the arguable of sedentary  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:44):**  agriculture kings and lawyers, we put seeds that matter to us in little pouches when we  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:50):**  went from one, you know, to another we humans, and hemp was in those pouches in much of the  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:11:57):**  world that millennia ago.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:00):**  So this is a key plant is that we've co evolved with it.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:05):**  We have a built in endocannabinoid system for receiving the plant.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:10):**  The plant gives up superfood from its seed, cannabinoids and health maintenance from its  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:15):**  flower and, and party favors from its flower and, you know, sandals, roosts and now it's  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:22):**  like plastic composites and super capacitors from its fiber as well as helping build soil.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:29):**  We have so much stressed and damaged soil from a century of misguided monoculture that  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:35):**  needs rebuilding and luckily we now have the tools with hemp and other plants.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:38):**  So we've humans have always used this plant way back, founding of the US but the founding  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:44):**  fathers did recognize the importance of hemp.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:49):**  I was very fortunate to be invited to harvest the first hemp crop at George Washington's  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:55):**  Mount Vernon estate in 200 years.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:12:58):**  And it was a great experience other than the fact that colonial sickles are very sharp  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:02):**  my thumb a little bit but other than that it was a wonderful experience to acknowledge  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:09):**  the essential role that hemp is always played in the US.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:12):**  All right, so let's talk about an important point in the book that you make tell me about  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:18):**  the moment that you call your climate Pearl Harbor that you had a few years back and what  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:24):**  it is changed in your life personally.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:26):**  Yeah, this is something that happened in 2013.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:29):**  Still, this morning when I was on the field I felt the sort of the hair rise on the back  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:34):**  of my neck because I heard a mountain lion calling in the distance and I just realized,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:37):**  you know, hey, this is what I've asked for right.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:41):**  I have asked for this life where I get to live in an E living ecosystem and truly Oliver  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:46):**  it is where my sanity resides to have a hummingbird wing in the feeder outside the window be my  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:52):**  alarm clock for our chat today, as opposed to, you know, beeping or an alarm car alarm  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:13:58):**  someplace out, you know, in the street outside because there is no street.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:03):**  I'm not complaining.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:06):**  But in 2013, what today is just a whole home another event 130,000 acre wildfire in my  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:15):**  backyard monsoon rains came a few days before we would have joined the world's 20 million  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:22):**  growing climate refugees put out this fire but before that happened, at the peak of the  
**[0:14:29-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:29):**  fire, a refugee from the wilderness surrounding our ranch storm down out of the hills, leaped  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:38):**  into our goat pen killed most of our goats hung around for about came back killed more  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:42):**  of the goats.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:45):**  We did have some survivors, fortunately, but then the bear went off and killed a bunch  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:49):**  of neighbors sheep and fishing game department killed the bear.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:14:54):**  And so this was a you as you mentioned, a Pearl Harbor type climate event for myself  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:02):**  and my family in that it's not a hypothetical event like we're living through this crisis  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:09):**  right now and it's a whole thing for the people who are suffering but it's a hypothetical  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:14):**  thing, thank goodness to my family, because we're not experiencing it, but we have experienced  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:21):**  change means and what you met with the writing on the wall is for humanity here and what  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:27):**  you might call the bottom of the ninth with two outs or if we've got a European audience,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:32):**  maybe we're talking about overtime in the World Cup football.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:37):**  But the we're at the critical moment where make as humans now matter.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:44):**  And one of the key things that it felt to myself and my family we could do to help stable  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:51):**  climate situation was plant help hemp ourselves and encourage others to plant it.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:15:56):**  And when I say plant hemp, I mean outside in real soil, because that there's carbon  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:02):**  and gives humanity a shot.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:04):**  Well, so let's focus on that.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:06):**  Now tell me about some of the benefits that hemp cultivation can have for our soils and  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:11):**  obviously extrapolating that out into benefits for the environment.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:17):**  The statistics, there's a lot of research about the amount of carbon that let's say,  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:24):**  um, in pre mount of topsoil in current, I forget about increasing agricultural land,  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:30):**  but if we if we just build an inch more tops, healthy topsoil in all existing agricultural  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:35):**  land, we're doing a huge, huge amount to stabilize climate and reduce carbon emissions and give  
**[0:16:43-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:43):**  humanity that window that we need to transition from a petrochemical industrial pipeline in  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:51):**  society and economy to a regenerative one.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:16:55):**  So agricultural law when it's non regenerative, what today we call conventional, I don't think  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:01):**  it's conventional, but conventional for the last 50 to 75 years.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:07):**  petrochemical fertilizers, toxic pesticides and herbicides, that kind of thing.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:12):**  Saltwater intrusion from over utilizing ground water, pesticide runoff into waterways and  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:18):**  ocean, all that business.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:20):**  That's the leading cause of climate change.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:26):**  And positive regenerative agriculture is the leading cause.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:29):**  It would be the leading catalyst for climate mitigation.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:33):**  So so much hinges on agriculture.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:36):**  It's one of the reasons why I am in the camp of folks who really encourages newcomers to  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:46):**  come to agriculture, hemp agriculture, certainly, but all regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:51):**  There's a school of thought amongst seasoned farmers, more seasoned farmers than myself,  
**[0:17:54-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:17:54):**  that say that feels, oh, these people that are just leaping in these green ones that  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:02):**  last year where, you know, strip mall managers or and all of a sudden they're planting, they  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:07):**  don't know what they're doing.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:09):**  And then let's say they do a good job and they harvest.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:10):**  They don't know how to market it.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:12):**  They don't know how to store it.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:13):**  I mean, there's there is wisdom viewpoint.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:17):**  And in American hemp farmer, the book, I try to address that and give people the tools  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:22):**  to plan ahead.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:24):**  And so we were talking about how to learn the best effective ways to learn second and  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:29):**  third languages.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:30):**  And it's a little bit like that with farming in that you have to do it day in and day out,  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:34):**  whether you're in the mood or not to learn.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:36):**  There's nearly no other way.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:38):**  We're at one just in the States, one percent of Americans farming today.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:43):**  There were 30 percent of Americans farming.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:46):**  Cannabis prohibition began in 1937 and 90 percent of Americans farming when the nation  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:51):**  was founded.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:52):**  So I'd love to see that one percent at least get back up to that 30.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:18:56):**  And for that to happen and we're here, I'm projecting that this will be done by regenerative  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:02):**  farming, in other words, by the techniques that helps.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:07):**  If it does happen, you know, it's it's going to make hemp a stable, stable crop the way  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:18):**  that corn, soy and cotton are today.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:19):**  We need hemp is rapidly growing.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:21):**  We'll have five hundred thousand acres planted this year.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:25):**  U.S. and but we have a long way to go if we want to catch combined corn, soy, cotton and  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:33):**  wheat.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:34):**  I think it's one hundred and eight million acres in the States.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:37):**  So we have a ways to go.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:40):**  But I want to see people get that seed in the ground because that's that's the only  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:44):**  way to to give humanity, really.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:47):**  Yeah, that's a fantastic overlook of this.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:49):**  And I've been looking into this aside from your book, but your book clarifies it really  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:53):**  well.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:19:54):**  And I'm extremely excited about the potential for ecosystem services that this crop has.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:00):**  But in doing interviews for this series on regenerative agriculture, I've talked to a  
**[0:20:04-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:04):**  number of practitioners and consultants who repeatedly say the best way to get growers,  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:13):**  producers to adopt anything new is to make it make sense financially.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:18):**  Can you tell me about the potential that hemp as a crop has for the industry of farming  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:23):**  and the practitioners themselves and what it can do for their business models, given  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:28):**  that there seems to be somewhat of a bubble in the industry just for a few of the the  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:35):**  many possible products that can come from this this one crop?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:39):**  Excellent question.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:40):**  And I 100 percent that it has to make financial sense, especially if we're talking about reviving  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:48):**  the independent entrepreneur.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:20:53):**  The this obviously has been the most struggling component of agriculture worldwide.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:00):**  We have farm aid, not dentist aid.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:03):**  Right.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:04):**  We have a concert to support farmers because they're struggling.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:06):**  You have the suicide crisis amongst farmers in India and elsewhere.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:12):**  Thousands and thousands of toxic sites and former farmland in Europe, China and everywhere.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:19):**  So it makes sense to farmers, especially farmers who are already financially struggling and  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:25):**  are on the brink of either having to lose their farm or give in and cave into BS development,  
**[0:21:33-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:33):**  selling out to non-needed housing units or commercial development or whatever it is.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:41):**  So again, in the book, I've really tried to lay out the metrics of what it might take  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:47):**  for an independent farmer to succeed.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:49):**  Now, I'll talk a little bit about that, but I'll start with the caveat, which is that  
**[0:21:54-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:21:54):**  all entrepreneurialism is extremely risky, especially when you're talking about relying  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:04):**  on the whims of Mother Nature or whatever your spiritual word is for the divine.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:09):**  So much has to go right.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:11):**  So if you're going to leap into this, you have to have a multi-year plan and you have  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:16):**  to have a passion that's not going to allow you to quit.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:21):**  And that's not going to allow you to quit as many people have.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:25):**  Most folks that I see trying to make it in hemp and regenerative agriculture are do or  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:30):**  die.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:31):**  They're not going to give up.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:33):**  But this multi-year plan issue is not so easy because we all have monthly bills to pay,  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:38):**  wages and kids to feed.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:42):**  So it's very easy for me as a journalist to say, don't expect positive revenue until you  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:48):**  work for a couple of years to really master not just your farming craft, but your processing  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:53):**  craft, your marketing craft, your distribution channels.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:22:57):**  Many people don't have the resources to have a multi-year plan, but I do believe you must  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:04):**  because hemp is not a get rich quick scheme.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:07):**  So as far as some of the tips that are addressed in the books or things that I've learned,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:13):**  and I do try to do it.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:14):**  I say as a journalist, it's easy for me to give advice, but it's very important for me  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:18):**  that I actually do this.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:20):**  You know, I've been farming already today.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:24):**  So this is not just theoretical for me.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:27):**  I do it all.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:28):**  I go through marketing a product.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:31):**  I would say my family's living is not dependent on my product, but I'm taking it very seriously.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:38):**  I need to implement the multi-year plan as a regenerative farm entrepreneur that I speak  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:42):**  about as an author and journalist and speaker.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:45):**  So first and foremost, I got some really good advice from Wendell Berry, the American farmer  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:51):**  philosopher.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:52):**  He's in his 80s.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:54):**  Colleagues asked me who I thought would be a great co-key note by myself at a speaking  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:23:59):**  event in the American South.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:02):**  And I said, if it's in the South, we got to get Wendell Berry.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:05):**  So I found out from his foundation how to contact him.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:08):**  You write him a letter at P.O.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:09):**  Box 1 in his town.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:10):**  And of course, I wrote him on hemp paper and maybe that was what impressed him, but he  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:14):**  called me back and I've saved his message.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:16):**  And paraphrasing, he basically said, I'm too old.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:17):**  I can't get to the conference, but here's the message I'd like you to convey, which  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:21):**  is if farmers want to be successful in hemp, they have to avoid the whole stakes that farmers  
**[0:24:28-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:28):**  have been making in soy and other crops, namely taking what's offered by middlemen and a way  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:37):**  of doing it.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:38):**  And I'm just basically getting screwed when someone else controls the prices.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:42):**  You have to control your industry and market your products.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:45):**  So the book is really big.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:47):**  Just think that when you harvest as a farmer, your work is not done anymore here in the  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:52):**  digital age.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:53):**  So you're at the beginning, the second half of the process, which is making and that is  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:58):**  not easy.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:24:59):**  It's so much work.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:00):**  And even if you make a great product, you've got to really work hard to get the word out  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:03):**  about it and find the markets and find the reseller and get out to events and farmers  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:10):**  markets and conferences and things like that.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:12):**  And if you do that, if you grow a great product, a great product and really work hard to get  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:19):**  the word out.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:20):**  I think that's a lot of ifs, you have a really good chance by, let's say you're having a  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:28):**  lot of success.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:29):**  And the short explanation for why I believe that is that fresh squeezed orange juice is  
**[0:25:34-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:34):**  going to beat frozen time as big ag moves into hemp cannabis, because it's a huge and  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:42):**  fast growing market, the fastest agricultural industry ever to cross a billion dollars of  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:45):**  revenue.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:47):**  Some people are going to go to their chain drug store and buy junk CBD or whatever it  
**[0:25:53-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:25:53):**  is in their bottle made who knows where, but they're the leading brand in hemp is this  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:02):**  top shelf and wine or find Parmesan cheese or a fine Spanish wine, whatever it is, how  
**[0:26:09-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:09):**  much that is better than just the cheap junk that one would find in a chain supermarket.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:17):**  And that is, I think the niche to go for, for the regenerative independent farmer.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:25):**  I'm really glad you brought that up because so many of the people that I've been speaking  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:28):**  to since I started this podcast, but also in the regenerative agriculture series that  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:33):**  I'm doing is, is echoing the exact same thing in that there is a lot to be made in agriculture,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:40):**  but you have to look at it as like a fully integrated business.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:43):**  And if you're producing large quantity, not worried too much about the quality and selling  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:48):**  at wholesale prices, there's a reason why that business model has been so difficult  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:53):**  to eke out a living in throughout history.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:26:56):**  However, now that we have all of the technological tools for someone to run an entire business  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:01):**  from their farm site, you're right.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:04):**  The harvest is only one part of it, but if you put in the work, if you put together a  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:07):**  team, even if you don't have the skillset personally to do all of this and build a business  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:12):**  that's fully integrated, where you take care of the processing, you're putting out value  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:16):**  added products and you're doing the marketing yourself.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah, it's a whole different business, but there is a lot of money to be made in that.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:24):**  And like you said, these sort of like cottage industries can come out of it and your business  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:28):**  is a perfect example of that.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:31):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:32):**  A good way to revive independent economies as well, because if you're producing locally,  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:37):**  packaging locally, you're spending money locally, there's that economic concept of the multiplier  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:41):**  effect that keeps investment regional.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:45):**  I really believe that there's a station of entrepreneurialism and that's when it's focused  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:54):**  on keeping the business regional.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:27:56):**  In American Hemp Farmer, I address things like how big is big enough for your enterprise?  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:01):**  Like what are your dreams?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:02):**  Do you want to be the Walmart of CBN, one of the 110 cannabinoids, or do you want to  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:10):**  create lucrative business for your family or your coalition of farming families and  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:14):**  your community where you kind of decide when is enough is enough in terms of both how far  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:21):**  do you want to expand in terms of region, in terms of reach?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:24):**  Do you want to be making a fine living distributing in electric vehicles within say 150 miles  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:29):**  of your farm?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:31):**  Or do you want to be global?  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:32):**  And I don't think there's necessarily one right or wrong answer to that.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:38):**  The key component is educating customers because are you willing to pay a little bit more for  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:47):**  this top shelf product that's coming right from your region?  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:51):**  And I think the answer for many people is yes.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:28:55):**  And another issue as we discussed is sort of everything in a regenerative light, marketing,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:01):**  packaging.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:02):**  I know in my product I work really hard to try to be a role model using largely non-like  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:09):**  packaging and labels that are compostable with non-toxic stick on it.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:16):**  And that's really expensive to do at this point, but there's no putting corners.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:21):**  In terms of knowing when enough is enough, I have this example in the book that I give  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:27):**  from a friend and colleague in Hawaii on the Big Island who, a native Hawaiian group that  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:33):**  is reviving the Hawaiian sandalwood essential oil industry that got wiped out, a number  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:39):**  of factors.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:42):**  And the goal is they have this one subgroup of ready trees, mature older trees that they  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:53):**  will process enough.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:54):**  They said they're not going to expand for two human generations.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:29:57):**  They're going to spend their lives and their next generations making sure that this is  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:01):**  a regenerative amount in their forest.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:03):**  And guess what?  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:04):**  It generates $6 million gross revenue per year.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:07):**  That's enough for them.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:08):**  Yeah, that's good.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:09):**  Six million off the go, any bigger.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:11):**  So I like that model of acknowledging limits, thinking of the earth as a system, but still  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:18):**  make it.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:19):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:20):**  That's a very surprisingly revolutionary way of looking at business, given that it's in  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:27):**  contrast to a lot of how businesses are taught to constantly be thinking about growth and  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:32):**  expansion.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:34):**  Let's go back to something that we talked about earlier and kind of break down this  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:39):**  sort of gold rush on cannabinoids, especially CBD.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:44):**  Now the industry has exploded in previous years, but you make the case for exploring  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:48):**  other cannabinoids that are perhaps underappreciated at the moment and looking at the full range  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:54):**  of products that can come from hemp rather than just focusing on this one.  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:58):**  Yep.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:30:59):**  So for folks who leapt into the wholesale CBD market and that growing hemp as though  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:08):**  it were ganja-like psychoactive cannabis has been growing for the last 50 years at the  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:13):**  top shelf level, female-owned seeded plants, which by the way is not my taste and not my  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:18):**  style but we'll get to that.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:20):**  So people growing what's known as sensimia, without seed, female-owned seeds.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:28):**  If you grew that three seasons ago, you were getting $3,000 a pound in a dispensary in  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:33):**  Oregon for CBD.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:35):**  Now today, $4 a pound.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:37):**  And that sounds so shocking, but it's just the way every gold rush works and every new  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:43):**  industry works too, really.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:45):**  The oil market stabilizes, there's wild, wild swings where there's incredible scarcity and  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:51):**  need and then an incredible glut and then it starts to balance and then maybe there's  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:31:55):**  a bad weather year and prices go up again and then a whole bunch of new gold rusher  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:00):**  prospectors go in.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:02):**  If you study the history of gold rushes, something's touched on a little bit in the book, the famous  
**[0:32:09-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:09):**  one in the states, gold rush of the 1840s in California, let's say, and then slightly  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:16):**  later in the Klondike region of North Canada and Alaska.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:22):**  The people who constantly made a lot of money during the gold rushes were the people selling  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:28):**  the supplies to the prospectors, not the prospectors themselves, people that were selling land  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:33):**  claims or shovel flowers and coffee and mules.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:38):**  Some of the descendants of those folks are still in places that I've lived in the American  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:45):**  West and some prospectors struck it big, but very few did.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:49):**  And then even some of those who did would get screwed over by unscrupulous middlemen  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:53):**  not paying real prices or not weighing the take honestly or whatever it is.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:32:58):**  So leaping in and following gold rush, there's something in it.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:05):**  There's a in our mindset where people are going to do it.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:10):**  It's going to be hard to keep people from doing it.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:13):**  I just don't recommend another CBD gold rusher because first of all, I don't think it's the  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:19):**  most regenerative way to cultivate.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:21):**  But secondly, unless you're doing your own value added marketing, the adjustment has  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:29):**  already started.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:31):**  But there's another reason why I don't advocate people being fully cultivators, let alone  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:39):**  just CBD only cultivators.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:40):**  And that is final quality of final product.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:44):**  I'm a big believer in what's known as the entourage effect of the whole plant.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:49):**  And here, we're just talking about cannabinoids and flower products here.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:52):**  So the architecture of the plant, as many of your listeners will already know, is the  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:33:57):**  plant produces a flower which something like 110 known cannabinoids in it with which the  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:04):**  most sort of famous are THC and CBDG and CB 100 known cannabinoids that work in concert  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:11):**  and in combination with one another and with other hydrocarbons, fragrant hydrocarbons  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:16):**  in the plant known as terpenes bioflavonoids to produce what's known as the entourage effect.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:20):**  And it's why just as different varieties of cheese and wine are very, very good varieties  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:24):**  of cannabis and hemp are very, very different.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:26):**  It's because the ratios of these components are determined by the genetics by them and  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:30):**  very much by the locality.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:33):**  There's a really misguided report that came out of a fairly top US university recently  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:40):**  that said only the genetics matter, not where you grow it.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:42):**  And I'm like, Oh, really?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:43):**  I've grown in five different states, the exact same seed and had widely different THC results.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:49):**  Like it matters hugely, hugely where you grow as well as you grow.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:34:54):**  And so you if you're talking about just so that's the flower side of the plant, the camera,  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:00):**  then the seed is the superfood incredible omega balance in the seeds which you can eat  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:07):**  whole D hold for the hearts present the hemp seed oil or eat the protein meal which is  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:11):**  the byproduct of the eye and my goats do it all.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:15):**  We love it all every day I've eaten hemp seed oil and hemp hearts already today.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:21):**  And also, cannabinoid intake, which I'll talk about my product combines flower and seed  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:27):**  but to get through the architecture we've got flower now in the cannabinoids seed in  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:31):**  the superfood fiber, one of the strongest fibers known but just one are planted in humanities  
**[0:35:38-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:38):**  plant fiber arsenal that is being used for everything from traditional components like  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:45):**  the hemp underwear I'm wearing today to bioplastic components.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:49):**  I'm holding a US grown 3d printed hemp plastic in my hands as we speak Oliver which I think  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:57):**  of as goodbye, goodbye Pacific Garbage Patch.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:35:59):**  So those are the three main components although we also should talk about leaves which are  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:03):**  viable for teas and other things and roots, which not only have traditional healing components  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:10):**  going back to midwifery and herbalism years old and Western and Eastern tradition but  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:17):**  are key in phytoremediation which is helping clean soil so that's all the architecture  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:21):**  of the plant.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:22):**  The older now is been in the flower side specifically this one component of CBD although the latest  
**[0:36:28-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:28):**  buzzword is CVG a sort of uplifting component has showing some health benefits.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:36):**  So for me it's not about isolating and making a pharmaceutical out of one component, a natural  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:42):**  component, it's about growing the cultivars that I like that have ratios the way we think  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:49):**  of Omega balance ratios in our food ratios, anions and terpenes in the entourage effect  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:55):**  using those flowers that I like and what I do in my products I infuse the flowers by  
**[0:36:59-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:36:59):**  old very ancient method of basically heating it up in a called decarboxylation.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:06):**  But the lipid that I use is hemp seed oil the superfood from the some of it from the  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:10):**  same plant so I've got the flower and the seed component in one product and that's what  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:15):**  I and my family like to eat every day so that's why I make a small batch of it commercially  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:20):**  as well.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:21):**  So thinking beyond this one cannabinoid gold rush and into a product that folks might want  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:26):**  to have long term in their life for health maintenance now separately if you are in Janelle  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:32):**  Ralf of Palmetto Harmony a South Carolina company she started a company based on specific  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:39):**  variety of cannabinoids of cannabis hemp that provided the cannabinoids that helped her  
**[0:37:44-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:44):**  daughters severe symptoms for it's a it's a different syndrome not directly in this  
**[0:37:52-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:37:52):**  epilepsy but think of it like epilepsy it's a seizures and really intense condition and  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:02):**  she found cannabis hemp certain varieties helped her daughter so she started a company  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:07):**  to grow these varieties.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:08):**  For her it is about jacking up certain components of the flower for specific needs of specific  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:16):**  people there's absolutely nothing wrong with that what I focus on though is health maintenance  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:20):**  for those of us not to be suffering and this is the model that I not necessarily producing  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:27):**  exactly this for the same way or the same reasons that I do but just beyond one or two  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:33):**  cannabinoids and more into maybe I want to do a chocolate covered hemp seed maybe I want  
**[0:38:37-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:37):**  to do a fiber paper product whatever it is other than the current gold rush I think is  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:45):**  the smart way to go.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:46):**  Yeah I mean there's so much potential here like you mentioned it's going to be interesting  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:50):**  to see how this industry starts to level out as it matures as it kind of gets over the  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:38:56):**  initial fluctuations of this gold rush and as the research starts to come out as they're  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:01):**  finally able to better explore and research all of the different cannabinoids that you  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:06):**  were talking about and perhaps even discover others so there's it seems like the sky's  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:12):**  the limit but it's going to depend a whole lot about how the industry adapts to it and  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:17):**  like you were mentioning too sort of the business models that smaller producers are able to  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:23):**  develop in order to keep the money with the producers and in their communities as well  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:28):**  and another thing that you mentioned in the book that I really wanted to highlight for  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:32):**  a second here because we already talked about how difficult it can be for someone to adapt  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:36):**  the farm business model that's based just on making a product and perhaps selling it  
**[0:39:41-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:41):**  at wholesale prices but actually going through all the steps to production, marketing, you  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:49):**  know it's not going to be feasible for everyone's operation and you highlight some of the options  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:54):**  for the roles that cooperatives and other business configurations can play in order  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:39:59):**  to prevent industrialization of hemp and keeping the money in the farm.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:04):**  Can you talk on that for a second?  
**[0:40:07-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:07):**  Yes.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:08):**  Flower relatively easy to produce and market although you still we only there's a Canadian  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:14):**  study a few years ago that says one percent of American homes have a hemp product so there's  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:18):**  huge market is true across the world huge only huge huge opportunity for market growth  
**[0:40:23-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:23):**  but there's you know obviously venues for flower products.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:31):**  Likewise seed and food I think is a smart long-term play especially for farmers who  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:37):**  have some acreage you could do it on 10 acres but it's certainly if you're thinking of transitioning  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:42):**  away from non-regenerative agriculture growing dioecious male and female which is what I  
**[0:40:47-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:47):**  grow even by the way for my flower product rather than since in sincemia if you if you  
**[0:40:54-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:40:54):**  grow dioecious for seed that's a really viable game plan again if you work hard for many  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:02):**  years fiber is much harder because in order for it to be valuable it's also extremely  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:08):**  important for humanity produce a lot of hemp fiber both for soil building and for the actual  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:13):**  products that result but the it requires a lot of acreage and so well I've been talking  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:20):**  about for years and writing about in this book and other journalism and trying to include  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:26):**  in the TV show it's a dream and it's easier said than done because they farming is like  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:31):**  hurting getting farmers to cooperate is like hurting cats it's worse than that cat herders  
**[0:41:37-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:37):**  joke about was like you know talking to farmers out there so but because fiber is so low value  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:50):**  it's in volume there's real potential for cooperative at efforts in a region and then  
**[0:41:57-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:41:57):**  talk a bit about the metrics of this farmer for the cheapest really professional turn  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:42:06):**  key fiber facility run I'm not sure what the Euro conversion is right now but about five  
**[0:42:11-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:42:11):**  to eight million dollar US dollar investment and it requires a minimum 3100 acres 3100  
**[0:42:20-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:42:20):**  acres again was that like 1500 hectares input to to feed that facility and that's the smallest  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:42:30):**  so that's a lot but not an insanely huge amount of acreage that's necessary to get a fiber  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:42:36):**  facility going and very very few farmers have the capacity to grow that much nor to invest  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:42:42):**  five to eight million dollars in getting the facility go oh the dream is say to farmers  
**[0:42:48-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:42:48):**  look he being herdable cats keep being competitive you know keep sniping at you know at your  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:42:56):**  confederate or whatever however you're only hopefully not that but in the end just form  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:02):**  a co-op for the fiber because you don't have to do much and open your gates so that the  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:07):**  co-op truck can come by and pick up your fiber and then everybody benefits from the resulting  
**[0:43:12-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:12):**  animal bedding material of feedstock super capacitor feedstock paper feedstock and if  
**[0:43:21-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:21):**  we're really ambitious textile feedstock so the potential in fiber but it requires volume  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:29):**  yeah yeah well I'm also really excited about the potential for expanding on the hempcrete  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:34):**  industry I did a great interview with April McGill back on a series on natural building  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:40):**  where she talked about all of the benefits of building with hempcrete as well and now  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:44):**  that it's increasingly being produced in the United States hopefully that could be an industry  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:48):**  that you know helps to transform the way we build our structures as well like like you  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:53):**  said so many times like there there's just so much potential in all of the products here  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:43:58):**  and the fiber being one of the byproducts it doesn't even need to conflict with the  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:03):**  income from the primary product for whatever growers incentive might be I'm so glad that  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:10):**  you mentioned building yeah that's another big one it's really easy to do it's very easy  
**[0:44:17-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:17):**  to make a structure to do it well and have it be well insulated it's a professional task  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:25):**  one might argue a bit of a learning curve for builders that do what today we think of  
**[0:44:31-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:31):**  as like the stick frame chain store drywall type building but in the end carbon sequestering  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:40):**  and absolutely wonderful I've been in some amazing hempcrete structures just projects  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:44):**  we've done around the house is unskilled by myself and my family it's just from our own  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:48):**  harvest it's very easy to make hempcrete very good I mean in general we need more specialized  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:44:54):**  builders and every region every climate zone every context is going to need something that's  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:00):**  properly adapted to there rather than this idea that you know stick frame and drywall  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:06):**  is going to be applicable in the best the best option for everywhere in the country  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:11):**  and beyond so it's going to be really interesting to see how different areas adapt to that and  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:16):**  as this industry continues to grow and local sources become available of products that  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:21):**  weren't possible to work with before hopefully the options are going to continue to grow  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:26):**  and the solutions are going to be continually adaptable and localized so I guess along that  
**[0:45:32-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:32):**  line there's so much further we could go into all of these things that we've talked about  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:38):**  today but to kind of round it off could you tell our listeners how they can get in touch  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:42):**  with you Doug as well as learn about so many of these other projects that you've got going  
**[0:45:46-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:46):**  on and where they can find the book.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:48):**  Thank you for asking that and thanks for the really wonderful questions.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:45:54):**  I guess the quickest spots for one stop exploration to start are my website which is just my name  
**[0:46:01-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:01):**  dot com that has everything from some recent videos right here it was I've been preparing  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:09):**  soil on the funky view ranch in New Mexico who links to some United Nations testimony  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:16):**  I've done about bringing back cannabis to two opportunities if you're interested in  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:21):**  checking out some of my books and or older journalism and on social media my handle is  
**[0:46:27-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:27):**  at organic cowboy it's all one word with the two season middle at organic cowboy and if  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:36):**  you're interested in the book specifically they should be available everywhere and I'm  
**[0:46:41-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:41):**  really interested now in doing virtual events in a fortuitous situation where at first when  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:50):**  right when we finished the audio book for American hemp farmers when everything in the  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:53):**  States and I thought everyone I didn't think so much about it but the publisher was like  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:46:57):**  oh darn what are we gonna do we had all these book tour events scheduled and now we're realizing  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:47:03):**  but by video it's even more powerful because I'm actually here with hemp seeds and soon  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:47:09):**  have plants like our crops gonna sprout any days I tactile things so folks are interested  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:47:15):**  in scheduling events I'm glad to do it super exciting while we're looking forward to following  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:47:20):**  all of that and the TV show coming out all these other projects that you have sound really  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:47:25):**  exciting to me I'm looking forward to staying in touch and and looking to you as a source  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:47:30):**  for information as this continues to grow and mature as an industry too so thank you  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/doug-fine/#t=0:47:35):**  so much for taking time today Doug it's been a real pleasure talking to you and let's thank

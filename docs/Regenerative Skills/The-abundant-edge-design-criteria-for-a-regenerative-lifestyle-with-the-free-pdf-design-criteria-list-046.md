**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:01:59):**  and blog post that you can read on the website under the news tab in the navigation bar.

**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:07):**  free PDF of the Abundant Edge building design criteria available as a free download on the

**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:20):**  is such an important and often overlooked and underappreciated aspect of permaculture.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:26):**  Now I see how big the movement around permaculture landscape management has become and why people  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:32):**  are so attracted to it and I think it's all wonderful and valuable and an essential step  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:36):**  for us as a global culture to take if we intend to continue living on this planet.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:42):**  But I also feel that some of the priorities are a little lopsided when it comes to the  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:46):**  essentials for life as human beings, especially in modern times.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:51):**  So a good way of putting things into perspective is by looking at the survival rule of threes.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:02:56):**  Now many of you probably already know them, they refer to food, water and shelter.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:02):**  So in general, a healthy human being can survive 30 days without food, 3 days without water,  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:08):**  but only 3 hours without shelter.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:11):**  Now obviously the shelter rule only applies in situations of extreme weather like extreme  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:15):**  cold, heat or storms.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:18):**  And in many places in the world you could live just fine without shelter for about 99%  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:23):**  of the year, but you sure want to have a good shelter option for that last 1% to say nothing  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:29):**  about climates where half the year or more you want to have a cozy space just to be comfortable  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:34):**  for most of the day.

**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:41):**  in an abundant system design and only touch on the topic of shelter by glossing over passive

**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:03:54):**  But let's take a look at why the built environment deserves a lot more attention if we really  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:04:00):**  want to design regenerative living systems.

**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:04:09):**  For the first time in history, more than 50% of the world's population lives in cities

**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:04:49):**  that that is going to require.

**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:12:55):**  Now obviously with permaculture design, microclimates are something that you can have a lot more  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:12:59):**  effect on as you start to design and manipulate the landscape.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:04):**  But there can be some major differences in let's say temperature or air flows based on  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:10):**  you know if there's a small grove of trees or a forest.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:14):**  The shade can really change the aspect of what you're able to plant there or how a passive  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:21):**  solar home might interact with the site if it's shaded out from a certain angle.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:27):**  And lastly, check your relative and absolute elevation.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:31):**  I'll talk about this for a second.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:33):**  So your absolute elevation is how high or low you are from sea level.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:39):**  And your relative elevation is very important for things like assessing flood risk.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:13:45):**  For example, if you're in a valley in the mountains like I am where I live here, you're

**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:02):**  to be safe from things like flooding.

**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:10):**  And this is where we really get into natural building per se.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:14):**  So what materials are available on site?  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:18):**  Building materials such as clay soil, stones, lumber, and suitable grasses could save you  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:24):**  tons of money in construction if you're able to incorporate them into your building.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:29):**  What materials are then available locally?  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:32):**  So immediately outside of your site.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:34):**  Check in with neighbors, community boards, municipal bodies, even dumpsters and landfills  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:40):**  could have perfectly good materials and even tools.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:43):**  Just get creative.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:46):**  And then from there, what materials are available at a distance but ideally have the lowest  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:51):**  embodied energy and lowest toxicity?  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:14:55):**  Now I would encourage you to always look in these cases for second hand recycled or refurbished  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:00):**  materials.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:02):**  Giveaways on Craigslist, garage sales, I mean there's tons of websites out there for reclaimed  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:08):**  and refurbished materials.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:10):**  And then if you still can't find what you're looking for and need to buy something new,  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:16):**  then you want to start looking at whoever's producing it most sustainably.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:20):**  So talking about like sustainably harvested lumber, using non-toxic preservatives or treatments.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:28):**  As just you know, one example.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:31):**  So all of these different site factors will set the limitations for the project.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:36):**  But don't be discouraged because limitations are actually essential for good design.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:42):**  Think of it this way, if somebody just handed you a blank sheet of paper and said draw me  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:47):**  a house, you'd have so many follow up questions.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:50):**  Like what kind of house?  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:51):**  Where is the house going to be?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:53):**  And all of those other things.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:54):**  Whereas if someone handed you a list of criteria of things that you could do and what you couldn't,  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:15:59):**  and what size the house had to be, and how many people would be living inside of it,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:03):**  you would have a lot more to work with about what you would start to design and draw.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:09):**  And all of those seeming limitations from the site assessment that you just did are  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:14):**  actually really going to fuel your creative juices and cause you to really think carefully  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:20):**  about what you're designing and how it interacts with that environment.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:25):**  Besides the next limitation is really going to set the pace.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:28):**  And of course I'm talking about either your clients or your own budget.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:32):**  So from here you're likely going to reassess your ambitions a good bit when you see the

**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:43):**  Take care of these first, see what you have left to work with, and then start adding on  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:48):**  your wants.

**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:16:56):**  So keep it clean you hippie, you don't want to get sick.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:17:00):**  This is really important.

**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:17:07):**  most of your meals at home.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:17:09):**  It's one of the most sustainable things you can do both for your wallet and for your health.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:17:14):**  So start with the basics and then get more luxurious from there if your budget allows.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:17:19):**  From there we go to sleeping.

**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:17:24):**  So while it may seem a bit more of a want I would definitely consider it a necessity.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:17:29):**  And you want to start thinking about the criteria in your building design that will allow for

**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:18:03):**  you're still going to want to consider convenient and secure places to at least store your essentials.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:18:08):**  But if you're like most people you're probably going to start to acquire other goods and  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:18:14):**  materials over time.

**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:19:03):**  well by the design for the structure.

**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:19:29):**  You want to be closing as many loops, recycling any waste products back into your system and  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:19:35):**  creating new uses and healthy applications for all of those things.

**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:20:25):**  that you're constantly going to be creating compost and useful material out of a waste  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:20:31):**  product that is otherwise churned into septic systems or a large treatment facility that's

**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:20:45):**  in correctly.

**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:21:10):**  Let me give you an example with relationships.

**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:24:04):**  inside of the house.

**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:25:11):**  The point of this exercise is to ask why at least once or twice when figuring out the

**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:25:29):**  when the initial ideas either are impractical or don't work in that particular application

**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:27:02):**  Putting clay plasters in the interior of your house really helps to moderate the humidity  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-design-criteria-for-a-truly-regenerative-lifestyle-with-a-free-pdf-design-criteria-list-046/#t=0:27:07):**  of the interior as well.

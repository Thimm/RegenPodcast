### Regenerative Skills  (Wed, 25 Jan 2017 10:40:21)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to The Abundant Edge, the podcast that explores the worlds of natural  
**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:05):**  building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:07):**  I am your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:13):**  Today we have a really remarkable guest, William Horvath.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:22):**  He's the founder of the website Permaculture Apprentice and has written a ton of invaluable  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:26):**  articles all about the practical steps he's taken on his own permaculture journey.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:31):**  This guy has an incredible backstory.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:33):**  He grew up in Croatia in a village just outside of the capital and as a kid he endured 4 years  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:39):**  of the Balkan War in the early 1990s, which he says shaped him as a person just as much  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:44):**  as growing up close to nature.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:46):**  After university he became a geologist and moved to Australia to work in the mining industry,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:51):**  but it only lasted about 5 years before he and his wife decided to quit their jobs and  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:55):**  move back to Croatia to take over the family land.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:00:59):**  Since then he's been documenting his experience on the website while setting up his own permaculture  
**[0:01:04-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:04):**  farm.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:05):**  He describes his business as an attempt to help novice farmers to design and set up their  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:10):**  farms and their lives so they can live fully and meaningfully.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:14):**  Now before we get started let me just give you a quick disclaimer.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:17):**  My internet connection here in rural Guatemala is not the best so there are times where the  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:22):**  audio cuts out a little bit or there's a bit of distortion.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:26):**  So just hang tight.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:28):**  It's not hard to get the context if you just listen through a little bit further.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:31):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:34):**  William thank you so much for being on the show with us today.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:38):**  How is things where you are?  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:40):**  Oh it's a little bit cold.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:43):**  And you know it's not like I don't like cold.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:48):**  You know it's definitely minus you know it's not cold.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:01:53):**  On the other side I enjoy winter because you know I can be inside in the house doing the  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:02):**  computer work and then next summer then you know I'm all outside so it's good.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:07):**  Yeah of course.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:08):**  I miss winter a lot.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:09):**  I'm from Minnesota originally but right now as you know I'm in Guatemala so even though  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:15):**  it's tropical I'm also in the highlands so it's not too humid and it's actually really  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:20):**  good weather for working right now.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:22):**  So hey so let's get started.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:24):**  Before I ask you about the practicalities of transitioning to a regenerative lifestyle  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:30):**  why is it important to make a change and what will happen if we don't start making a transition  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:35):**  in our way of living?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:37):**  Well I would say we are really truly in a unique point in history.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:45):**  You know there are a lot of things happening.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:47):**  You know we are on so many unsustainable trajectories that you know before you know people were  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:54):**  concerned before people were saying before that things are you know about to change.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:02:58):**  But I would say that you know probably next you know 10, 20 years that the changes you  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:02):**  know that are going to happen to our society both technological changes and changes in  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:07):**  the environment are you know truly unique.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:11):**  So I think that you know that first we need to understand what's the context of you know  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:18):**  what's happening with our society in order to be prepared for the changes that are coming.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:25):**  And this is probably because then you know once we know what's happening where we have  
**[0:03:29-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:29):**  it then we can take you know knowledge is power then we can take actions and be proactive.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:40):**  And that's why I always say that a lot of people are feeling anxious and that anxiety  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:47):**  actually is realizing the gap between what people know and what people know that they  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:52):**  should be doing and what exactly they are doing.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:03:56):**  So I would say that it's time that we all kind of take responsibility for our actions  
**[0:04:04-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:04):**  and in the same time try to provide our needs and simultaneously regenerate the land and  
**[0:04:14-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:14):**  do our best to contribute to a better future you know for ourselves and our families.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:22):**  Yeah of course and now you've been a big promoter of permaculture and the lifestyle that's included  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:28):**  with that as one of the solutions as one of the antidotes from these changes that are  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:32):**  probably not going to be positive in the upcoming time.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:37):**  And a lot of people who are listening to this podcast are already familiar with the basics  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:41):**  of permaculture but what are some of the common misconceptions and sort of what it takes to  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:48):**  live the lifestyle that you'd like to correct or sort of give better advice on?  
**[0:04:53-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:04:53):**  Firstly I would say that permaculture is not just about people who are thinking about permaculture  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:06):**  it's about just learning food.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:08):**  Permaculture is a design science so initially permaculture you're designing your lifestyle  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:19):**  and growing food is just one part of that lifestyle.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:24):**  People need to think recently when it comes to permaculture.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:30):**  So of course you have to have your ethics and then you have principles and it's how  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:33):**  you apply those principles to your life.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:38):**  That's how you I would say live the permaculture lifestyle.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:43):**  But I would say that that kind of lifestyle it's harder when you think about the practicalities  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:53):**  how you're going to transition to that lifestyle and how you're going to live it.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:05:57):**  So I would say people sometimes they're romanticized about that lifestyle and they're not aware  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:04):**  of what it takes really if you want to fully embrace.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:08):**  Of course you can always do composting in your apartment or you can have your garden  
**[0:06:15-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:15):**  but if you want to make a difference in your life then it's not as easy as people think.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:25):**  So that's the whole thing there is no single way that you can transition or live a lifestyle  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:33):**  that is true to that values of permaculture.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:35):**  There is no one recipe, each situation is different.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:38):**  I would say since I'm all about transitioning to permaculture lifestyle and trying to make  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:45):**  a living from permaculture lifestyle one needs to be aware of that there is a lot of uncertainty  
**[0:06:53-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:06:53):**  when it comes to living day to day or month to month or year to year fully embracing that  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:02):**  lifestyle and making a living from it.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:05):**  Sure it's probably not one of those things that once you've got the farm once you've  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:12):**  got a couple of systems in place then you're finished.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:16):**  It's an ongoing process and it needs to be maintained as well.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:21):**  Yeah it's a long term thing.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:24):**  It's not like I'm going to try to do a permaculture lifestyle and have a farm and I'm going to  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:37):**  do that for a while.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:39):**  It's a long term goal and once you take that angle looking from that perspective you have  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:47):**  plenty of time.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:48):**  You don't have to do it in year one, you can do it slowly and gradually because if you  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:07:57):**  want to live with a class or just certain values that you need to embrace and those  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:03):**  values are your core beliefs and they're not gone in a year or two.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:09):**  As I say it's a long term goal and slowly but surely people can come to that goal but  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:15):**  it's not easy.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:16):**  I agree with that.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:20):**  Now though you're not at the end of your process, nobody is, you've become one of the many success  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:25):**  stories of people who've transitioned from conventional lifestyles to more regenerative  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:29):**  ones based on permaculture principles.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:31):**  What have been some of the changes from the way that you used to live?  
**[0:08:35-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:35):**  Well I would say that I live a pretty normal life.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:48):**  The last five years I worked as a geologist in Australia and by having a really, let's  
**[0:08:58-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:08:58):**  say, a special work day and it allowed my wife and I to live a normal life.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:09:06):**  We had a house, we lived in the suburbs and by all means a normal nine to five.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:09:13):**  It's not nine to five for me because for my wife I was working on a roster two weeks on  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:09:21):**  a week off.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:09:22):**  But I would say the main change is we're now living a simple life.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:09:26):**  We moved to Croatia which is, you could say that Australia is much more, the living standard  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:09:39):**  is much higher than Croatia but here we're living a much simpler life and we downsized  
**[0:09:44-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:09:44):**  our lifestyle and we definitely do less travel, we spend less money.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:09:54):**  But I would say our lives are a better way to live.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:10:00):**  We work here more for food and I would say also help your life because by default, let's  
**[0:10:07-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:10:07):**  say, the full-blown lifestyle in Australia is much more unhealthy than here.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:10:16):**  Here when you default to kind of, let's say, just normal living, food is much better quality  
**[0:10:24-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:10:24):**  and things happen much, people here are much more, the community, the household community  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:10:37):**  is much more present here than in Australia.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:10:42):**  So I would say overall we downsize our lifestyle, we need less money, we spend less money, we  
**[0:10:49-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:10:49):**  are first in a row food, we spend more time with my family and friends.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:10:57):**  That's why I say it's a better quality of life.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:01):**  So more human healthy life overall and that's the thing with having, let's say, achieving  
**[0:11:12-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:12):**  that lifestyle where you have a lot of money but trading that for less fulfillment in life.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:21):**  I would say that we are both feeling much more fulfilled with our lives here.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:28):**  That's a long answer to your question.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:29):**  No, I definitely understand what you're talking about.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:31):**  I'm doing a similar thing here in rural Guatemala and you're definitely right about how sometimes  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:37):**  countries which are less developed by a certain index actually default to a higher quality  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:42):**  of food and of living than you would otherwise in say Australia or the United States or other,  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:49):**  you could even call them overdeveloped countries.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:52):**  And the items that you go to come from your local community.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:11:58):**  It's a lot easier to live by the principles that a lot of us find to be very important  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:06):**  in our transitions.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:07):**  Now you currently run a website that helps people to transition into this permaculture  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:12):**  lifestyle.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:13):**  How do you define the permaculture lifestyle?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:16):**  I would define a permaculture lifestyle as living a life in which you are honoring the  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:26):**  ethics of permaculture and you are looking through the lens of permaculture principles.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:33):**  And the main way that we are expressing that permaculture lifestyle, at least what my main  
**[0:12:38-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:38):**  focus is, once we have that land, then we are expressing what our core beliefs are.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:48):**  We are expressing that the values that we have honoring the ethics and looking through  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:55):**  the lens of permaculture principles.  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:58):**  Excellent.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:12:59):**  And as I said, we are expressing that through the lens.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:04):**  So more practically, I would say that we are doing good for the environment while at the  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:11):**  same time taking care of ourselves, our family and the community around us.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:18):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:19):**  Now for people who are hoping to make this change, what are some of the most important  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:23):**  aspects that we should consider when changing their lifestyle to a regenerative one?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:29):**  Well, I would say that it all depends on their unique context.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:36):**  Everything is dependent on their unique situation in life.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:43):**  So as I said before, there is no single recipe for succeeding this kind of lifestyle.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:49):**  We all have different lives and let's say for me and my wife and I, in our 30s we don't  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:13:59):**  have kids.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:00):**  We have a lot of people, family and friends here, so we came back to Croatia.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:05):**  For somebody else, if somebody is letting 40 have kids and is making, is only invested  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:14):**  in his or her 9-5 job, then it's a completely different situation.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:21):**  So that's why I said the most important aspect is your unique context.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:25):**  You always start from that.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:26):**  You start with identifying what your goals are, what your vision is for the future, why  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:34):**  you want what you want.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:36):**  So that's the starting point.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:40):**  I would say one of the other aspects, as I already looked at before, is that you try  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:46):**  to leave this kind of changing of your lifestyle to a regenerative one.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:52):**  You need to start to think like an entrepreneur.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:14:59):**  You need to start to embrace that mindset.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:05):**  That means you need to be prepared for uncertainty and be prepared that you're going to fail.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:15):**  You need to do a small test and then scale up.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:20):**  So there's a lot of overlap between being a farmer, a permaculture farmer and being  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:26):**  an entrepreneur.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:27):**  Basically they are the same thing.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:28):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:29):**  I agree.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:30):**  I think those things that you mentioned are also really good life attributes to help someone  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:36):**  grow as a person, not just in business or in farming or anything.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:39):**  Yeah, that's a good point.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:41):**  That's an excellent point.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:42):**  That's what I would say.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:45):**  Trying to live a permaculture life myself, obviously the main thing that people are trying  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:51):**  to say is that I want to be free.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:53):**  I want my freedom.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:54):**  I want my freedom of choice.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:55):**  I want to do what I think is right.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:15:58):**  I want to be free of being trapped.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:01):**  So that's why I say people need to embrace that kind of mentality that you also say is  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:10):**  also good for their personal growth.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:16):**  I would say making a life of choices.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:18):**  If you can do that, you will have much more choice.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:22):**  Another thing I would say is that a lot of people maybe forget or disregard is that you  
**[0:16:34-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:34):**  need to ensure that you have support if you have a partner.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:42):**  Not that you kind of, you just need to be on board.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:49):**  She or he needs to be on board with the idea of a lifestyle change.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:54):**  So it's not easy.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:16:56):**  If you secretly want something that your partner doesn't want, then obviously that's a big  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:04):**  problem.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:05):**  So that's a really important aspect of these two ones that I said before.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:10):**  Of course.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:11):**  Yeah, it's always easier when everyone who you're going through your life with is on  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:15):**  board and willing to help out and working towards the same goals, I completely agree.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:20):**  Now to get a little more personal with your situation, you've become established over  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:25):**  a couple of years now.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:26):**  You have your farm running and your business is going.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:29):**  If you could go back to a few years ago when you were just getting started in this lifestyle  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:33):**  change, what advice would you give yourself?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:36):**  Definitely it would be that I should be finding more mentors, visit more farms, do more volunteering,  
**[0:17:49-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:49):**  connect with more people because that actually propelled my career in permaculture lifestyle  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:17:58):**  and permaculture farming was exactly what finding mentors that were willing to teach  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:06):**  me.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:07):**  I would never forget I had two or three of them when I was in Australia.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:15):**  I was lucky that I ended up as a woman with a really intelligent retired horticulturalist  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:23):**  who was having market garden at the same time.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:26):**  She was willing to teach me and I was teachable, I was willing to learn.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:35):**  Imagine if you can, somebody who is like 64 or 65 years old and has a life full of experiences  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:42):**  in business and growing and horticulture trees and everything and asking him questions like  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:48):**  if you were me in my age what would your advice be, what would you do, what would you focus?  
**[0:18:56-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:18:56):**  Certain things that I was then taught stayed with me and I applied them.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:05):**  I said what would be the most important thing that you can tell me?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:09):**  He said always do small tests and think in small modules.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:13):**  If you are a small one, it is bad and if you are very big and small, then copy and scale.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:19):**  Copy and scale, leave yourself enough room to copy and scale.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:25):**  So it is those kind of people and I also visited David Holmgren and his wife Sugu and just being  
**[0:19:32-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:32):**  around there talking with them, learning about smoses and learning about their systems, they  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:41):**  stayed safe with me and I would say to myself meet more people, want you more, find more  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:48):**  mentors and connect with more people.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:50):**  That is the most important thing that I would suggest to anybody out there.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:19:55):**  Sure, I think that is really valuable especially for all the information that is out there  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:00):**  on the web.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:01):**  People tend to just focus on things that sort of reaffirm what it is they are trying to  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:06):**  specify in or the topic that they are trying to learn but I have definitely found since  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:12):**  working on farms myself, many of the locals will help you out a ton with those problems  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:17):**  that you might have that are specific to your location.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:20):**  Even if they have not been practicing permaculture or regenerative farming specifically, they  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:26):**  have been in that area long enough to observe the changes, to understand certain parts of  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:32):**  the landscape that are conducive to what you are trying to achieve and even if it is technically  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:38):**  a different method of farming, there is a ton of knowledge to be gained in there.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:43):**  And I would also say that it does not have to be necessary in a permaculture farm because  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:20:54):**  there are so many skills in permaculture that we need in establishing our farms.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:01):**  So finding mentors in business, finding mentors in just like a horticulturalist who does not  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:09):**  have any permaculture experience can also help.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:15):**  Absolutely and I think it goes further than just learning skills.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:19):**  It is another way of reconnecting with your community.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:21):**  A lot of us, almost like I am doing right now, are reaching out to people on the other  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:25):**  side of the world but as long as it does not get in the way of your interactions with your  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:32):**  own community, with the people who have things to teach you as well that are a lot closer  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:37):**  by.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:38):**  That is a great point.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:41):**  So what on the other side of that have been some of your biggest successes or things that  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:46):**  you are most proud of since you changed to a permaculture lifestyle?  
**[0:21:50-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:21:50):**  Well, as I said in the beginning, people get anxious when there is a gap between what they  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:02):**  know they should be doing and what they are doing.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:05):**  So I am also a little bit like that, not like everybody else.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:10):**  So I tend to get anxious if I do not make progress on my goals.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:15):**  So I would say that on one side it is motivating me to just do projects.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:26):**  I have a few projects running on my farm but I also have my online presence and my offline  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:33):**  farm.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:34):**  So I am kind of pursuing projects in both areas and on my farm I would say that the  
**[0:22:41-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:41):**  biggest success this year was definitely establishing my food first where I actually planted 200  
**[0:22:49-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:49):**  trees and I have done the key line design and the green mulching and swales.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:22:58):**  So that was all done this year also with limited time.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:04):**  Yeah, that is a huge step.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:07):**  The whole system, as I said, that I work as a mentor, I would say that establishing systems.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:19):**  So maybe my first year, my growing my food first and planting trees and I would say that  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:27):**  I have done many mistakes.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:29):**  This year I started my own nursery, growing trees from seeds and cuttings and everything.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:37):**  So I would say that this year I was doing all that but I developed the system.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:41):**  So now each new year I am just going to build on what I learned.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:47):**  So I would say I am not proud of my tests that I have done and experiments and everything  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:23:56):**  that I was doing establishing a system that I can then scale up.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:01):**  But there could be the offline farm stuff but I would say also that I completed my work  
**[0:24:11-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:11):**  environment so I am not working anymore in a job that I don't like and hang around with  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:19):**  people that I don't like.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:21):**  I remember when I was in Georgia sitting with the CEO of my company and the project matches  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:32):**  and they were drinking wine and I would be with them and I would be saying how they need  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:37):**  to deceive the local people so they don't see what they are about to do with the environment  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:44):**  and everything.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:46):**  And I felt really not true to myself so I would say that my work environment that I  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:52):**  am currently in, communicating and hanging out with farmers, with like-minded people  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:24:58):**  in permaculture, with people from my website, even this interview with you, this is my work  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:03):**  now.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:04):**  So I can say that I am not talking with people, smart people trying to do the same thing.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:13):**  So that was a huge success, not being forced to work in a job that I don't like, work with  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:24):**  people that I don't like and finally doing something for my future.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:31):**  So I would say that before maybe I was earning money and saving that money, I also knew that  
**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:38):**  I was working for my future but now I am really doing things, practical things on my side  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:46):**  so that excites me enormously.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:48):**  Yeah, those are all huge steps.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:51):**  Let's take some time now and kind of switch gears.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:53):**  We have been talking about some of the theory and the idea behind making a lifestyle change  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:25:59):**  but what a lot of people find is that one of the gaps in the education that a permaculture  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:26:03):**  design course gives is how do you actually implement your design once you have made one.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:26:09):**  Now in your case, how did you figure out where to start?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:26:14):**  Well, I didn't know at the time but when I was at David Holm with the Space, I was just  
**[0:26:22-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:26:22):**  going through a permaculture design course from Jeff Worton and once the whole lectures  
**[0:26:30-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:26:30):**  were finished, I got the one-page instruction from Jeff saying, first you, it says something,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:26:42):**  your goals, invent a design site and then you are done, something like that.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:26:51):**  So then I realized that I will need to do a lot of research.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:26:55):**  I was also at David Holm so there was a lot of books, I was talking to many people so  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:01):**  I realized that I am doing my own research and just learning and putting that on paper  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:07):**  and trying to teach somebody.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:12):**  Because I was teaching it, I needed to learn it twice.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:15):**  So I was able to find actually that I had a skill to take a lot of information and basically  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:25):**  to step to step and that's what I applied to my life every time when I meet new situations.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:33):**  So in a situation where I need to figure out how I am going to implement my design, I went  
**[0:27:43-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:43):**  to the WISC, the podcast, whatever, and then everything needs to make sense in a step by  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:53):**  step.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:27:54):**  It needs to be something that I can deconstruct the whole thing into simple step by step instructions  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:01):**  that I can use.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:03):**  So that's how I was able to figure it out.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:06):**  Of course, there were a lot of people who were already teaching it but I was just, you  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:13):**  know, able to take all that info and make it as practical as possible because there  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:20):**  are a lot of good designers out there but I am just ordinary, I am nothing special,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:26):**  I am just ordinary permaculturist who wants to do things on his farm.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:30):**  So it's important to deconstruct the huge, big, let's say all the big research into simple  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:39):**  steps.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:40):**  And then once you have your instructions, then it's only a matter of being practical,  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:48):**  develop your priorities based on your priorities, being practical with how you are going to  
**[0:28:55-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:28:55):**  implement which steps first and then it comes to just being resourceful with your time,  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:06):**  with your budget and everything.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:10):**  Certainly, those practical steps get the ball rolling even if they seem like insignificant  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:18):**  aspects in the beginning.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:21):**  You got to start somewhere and that's definitely important to figure out where that point is.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:26):**  Now on the other side of that, what are some of the main things that people overlook when  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:31):**  they are planning for their farm?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:33):**  Well, I would say it comes down to the cost of, first of all, why they are doing it and  
**[0:29:49-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:49):**  they need to be clear on why because I get a lot of people sending me emails, I want  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:29:57):**  to go, I have my property, I don't know what should my first step be.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:04):**  So if you don't know why you are doing something, if you don't know what your vision is for  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:09):**  your place, then you won't be able to know exactly how to get there and won't know what  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:16):**  exactly steps you should take, what your goals should be.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:19):**  So that's why I always kind of encourage people to think about their why because their why  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:25):**  is the first thing.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:28):**  So if you are planning a permaculture farm, you need to understand why you are doing it.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:34):**  Is it because of the life quality, because you want healthy food for your family, you  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:43):**  want toxic environment, you want freedom.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:47):**  So once you understand why you are doing it, it will help you in developing your farm because  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:53):**  it will be a lot of money and then you can also establish a vision.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:30:58):**  From there, from that vision you will know what steps to take.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:04):**  It's also a matter of people having, let's say, making a design and thinking that they  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:12):**  need huge piles of money.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:15):**  And I would say that people should focus on easy solutions that don't require a lot of  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:20):**  money.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:21):**  I always have plans for my property and those plans are, oh I need to do this, I need to  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:26):**  do that, but then I eventually stop and reflect.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:30):**  And I ask myself, are we doing that?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:33):**  Is trading closer to my goal?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:37):**  And if the answer is no, then let's say that I scrapped a project that could be, I don't  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:43):**  know, three or four thousand dollars that I didn't have to spend.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:48):**  So rather than asking how can I spend my money, people should be asking what I shouldn't be  
**[0:31:53-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:53):**  spending my money on.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:54):**  Oh absolutely.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:31:55):**  I would say it's a matter of asking the right questions.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:02):**  Yeah that's true of a lot of things.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:04):**  Now when it comes to practically implementing steps on a farm, what are some of the steps  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:09):**  that people have the most trouble with?  
**[0:32:11-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:11):**  Well I would say that just starting out, and that means being clear on what their goals  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:20):**  are and then basically the goals, trying to understand their site and making a design.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:27):**  So these are all steps that people would, oh I need to do a sale or something, I don't  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:34):**  know how to do a sale, but why do you want to do a sale?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:38):**  Do you understand your site?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:39):**  What are your goals?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:40):**  Are you trying that your site blends to your goals?  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:46):**  There are so many things that aren't clear in that beginning.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:53):**  So that's what people struggle the most.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:32:55):**  The first basic steps, which direction they should take with their farm, which direction  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:01):**  they should take when it comes to making a living.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:03):**  Just starting out.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:04):**  All the steps in that starting out are problematic for people.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:09):**  So sometimes you could say people would like to know more about sales.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:18):**  So obviously the sales are the steps that they have the most trouble with.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:22):**  But I would say rather than sales, rewind and think about why you need sales and understand  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:31):**  your site really needs sales.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:33):**  So that comes down to understanding the patterns of climate and weather and everything.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:43):**  I would say sometimes people don't know what they should be.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:49):**  They don't know what steps they have on their own because they are not even aware of those  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:55):**  steps.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:33:56):**  And that's where I try to guide them in the direction.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:00):**  Maybe you should think first about your goals and then understanding your site and then  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:04):**  design based on that and then implementing and thinking about what you really need.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:11):**  To expand a bit on what you're talking about, it's really easy to get caught up in all of  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:15):**  the very nifty little aspects of permaculture.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:19):**  Like you said, putting in swales, thinking about things like hula culture beds or whatever  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:25):**  else is popular or fashionable that people are just starting to discover.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:31):**  As great as those things are, it may not apply to the projects you're trying to work on and  
**[0:34:36-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:36):**  people try and put them in situations just because they know that it's something that  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:43):**  they want or something that they're excited about.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:47):**  So other than simply growing food crops and managing a farm, what are some other ways  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:53):**  that people can make a good living with a permaculture lifestyle?  
**[0:34:58-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:34:58):**  I recently ran a post which was actually outlining seven different ways people can make a living.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:07):**  And being a permaculture farmer is only one of them.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:12):**  So there is a whole thing that is strategic about what you can do.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:20):**  I said on the post outline, seven of them.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:26):**  One is farmer of course and then you have secondary producer.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:30):**  So you don't have to be primary producer, you can buy primary produce from somebody  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:36):**  and then evaluating that and selling.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:39):**  Then you don't even have to do being primary producer or secondary, you can just market  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:44):**  and distribute those primary products.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:49):**  So marketing and distribution is also something you can grow and make a living.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:35:56):**  Then of course nursery and not nursery, just plant propagation, animal breeding as well.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:02):**  Because people need, I would say as permaculture is becoming bigger and bigger as a movement,  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:08):**  plants, permaculture plants are becoming really interesting for people.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:15):**  Actually fixing plants, there are huge possibilities with establishing permaculture nursery and  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:25):**  then selling all the plants in a guild.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:32):**  For example, specially adapted like Mark Sheppard is doing, specially adapted hazelnuts, resistant  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:41):**  to drought and flood.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:43):**  So nursery is of course a big one.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:45):**  There can be all kinds of services that are related to the farm itself or farming.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:36:53):**  You can rent out something, your rooming or even a small hut or something and maybe provide  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:06):**  some health care with the herbs that you are growing.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:08):**  There is also one aspect that people can also use.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:13):**  And then of course there is teaching and education on the site.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:17):**  That's something that's been proven as a good model for people making a big source of income.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:26):**  So that's something if you have already established the site, then people will come here for tours  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:31):**  and you can do teaching as well.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:35):**  And finally there is a consulting and that's of course once you have your site or you are  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:40):**  doing something in the permaculture community, then you can do also consulting.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:46):**  Whether it's just designing and you can be also implementing design and that's what  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:52):**  POC is doing.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:53):**  So I would say there is plenty of opportunities and there is something that is even offsite  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:37:58):**  income that's not related to permaculture.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:00):**  But here is the thing, I'm currently doing I would say 3-4 things from this list.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:08):**  And it's not like just one thing will make 100% of my income.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:16):**  That's a highly effective way of doing business but it's not resilient.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:22):**  So like in permaculture we think about polyculture of crops and we need to think about polyculture  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:31):**  of incomes.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:33):**  So there is a huge variety but then there is a whole thing of transitioning to one of  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:39):**  those careers or occupations over there.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:43):**  And that's a whole other thing that I'm working on currently on a course.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:50):**  Just outlining that.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:51):**  From what I learned by doing it myself and what I saw other people doing it.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah absolutely, like you were talking about the diversity helps to create a resilience  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:02):**  not only in your farm but in your lifestyle as well.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:05):**  If you are drawing from multiple income streams it gives you some insurance in case one of  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:11):**  those streams has a down year or maybe your farm doesn't take the yields that you are  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:16):**  hoping for or any sort of other thing that can't really be expected or planned for.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:22):**  Exactly.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:23):**  And it's not like we are trying to be…  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:27):**  Sorry I'm just going to say one more point.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:31):**  It's not like we are trying to be just resilient.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:36):**  There is even more level more above a resilient anti-prejure.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:41):**  In a situation where in a variable everything is not everything is changing but our world  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:52):**  is changing.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:39:53):**  So the more income streams you have the higher probability of one of them really benefiting  
**[0:40:02-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:02):**  one of your many occupations and really benefit from let's say something that happens that  
**[0:40:10-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:10):**  usually for other people would mean okay there was their jobs and they may be redundant but  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:16):**  as you have more income streams then you can even benefit from disruptions let's say  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:22):**  in the future.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:23):**  Yeah that's a great point.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:25):**  Now what were some of your biggest challenges in becoming established on your farm and becoming  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:31):**  financially independent with your own business?  
**[0:40:34-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:34):**  Well as I said, embracing the entrepreneur in my mind I would say that the biggest challenge  
**[0:40:46-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:46):**  is of course living in uncertainty and kind of constantly living outside my comfort zone  
**[0:40:53-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:40:53):**  I would say that there is a thing you either have security but then you are trapped in  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:05):**  a job or you have uncertainty but then you are free.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:12):**  So it's kind of you don't have both.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:14):**  Well sure you can but I would say you have a huge savings and can do a lot of risks without  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:25):**  any questions you know with a huge savings like that okay sure you will be fine but as  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:31):**  you are starting out things are uncertain.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:33):**  Yeah I think that's something that a lot of people starting out in this lifestyle are  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:39):**  able to relate to.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:41):**  Now aside from your own website what resources would you point people towards if they want  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:48):**  to learn more about what you do and what permaculture lifestyle requires and steps towards that  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:55):**  in general?  
**[0:41:56-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:41:56):**  Well I would say that of course my side Permaculture Apprentice that's the whole point of that  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:42:05):**  website was solving my own problem as I am going to this transition about having a practical  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:42:12):**  angle to all that so that's of course that's also resource for the time I am using because  
**[0:42:19-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:42:19):**  when I do this blog post it's like I am writing instruction manual for myself I really sometimes  
**[0:42:27-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:42:27):**  find myself okay so oh my god I am doing this I am doing this fast and then I will be referencing  
**[0:42:35-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:42:35):**  my articles just to see if I am doing it correctly just to remind myself or just to see what  
**[0:42:43-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:42:43):**  I was writing so I would say that that's kind of the first place people can look and that's  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:42:52):**  of course my website.  
**[0:42:53-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:42:53):**  The second one would be economic action team community and that platform where there are  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:02):**  a lot of I am teaching there but there are a lot of teachers like Mark Sheppard and others  
**[0:43:06-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:06):**  who are and Wayne Dorvan that are teaching similar angle of course but he is still one  
**[0:43:17-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:17):**  when it comes to making a living in permaculture because he was doing it in the last 30 years  
**[0:43:23-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:23):**  so those two places and then of course permaculture voices it's a huge one for me because as I  
**[0:43:31-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:31):**  was thinking about what should I do with my life I was listening to Diego from permaculture  
**[0:43:36-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:36):**  voices and he had huge amounts of people who are in the same situation who are in a position  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:43):**  or who is currently in a transition giving away their experience secrets and everything  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:49):**  so those three places I would recommend.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:54):**  Fantastic and I will put links for all our listeners in the show notes at the end.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:43:59):**  Well thank you so much you have been so generous with your time I really appreciate it William  
**[0:44:05-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:44:05):**  and I hope we can catch up with you again soon I am sure there will be a lot more questions  
**[0:44:08-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-002/#t=0:44:08):**  by then.

### Regenerative Skills  (Sun, 22 Jan 2017 10:32:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to the very first episode of The Abundant Edge. This is the  
**[0:00:04-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:04):**  podcast that dives deep into the worlds of natural building, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:07-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:07):**  regenerative living. I'm your host Oliver Gautier, let's get started.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:30):**  Hello and welcome to the very first episode of The Abundant Edge. I'm so  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:35):**  excited to get this started. This is going to be a little bit different from  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:39):**  the episodes in the future. I'll be introducing myself and giving a bit of  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:42):**  background explanation and a bit of what's coming up in future episodes. For  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:47):**  this I'm also going to go into a little bit of detail about my personal story  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:50):**  because I've met many others in the regenerative living world with similar  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:54):**  stories and even if you haven't had similar experiences I know that many of  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:00:58):**  you have been motivated by the same things that I have. So a quick little bit  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:02):**  about me. I was born in Japan in 1988. I lived there for seven years with my  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:07):**  family. I'm one of five children so I've got a lot of brothers and sisters. I  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:12):**  moved nine times before leaving to go traveling when I was 17 years old. I  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:16):**  traveled independently for about 11 years now and since then I've been to  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:22):**  just about every continent except for Antarctica. I've also had a wide variety  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:27):**  of jobs including construction and remodeling, farming in both industrial  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:31):**  and organic agriculture. I have been a teacher for children and taught English  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:36):**  language both in Guatemala and South Korea. I've been a chef and a baker, a  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:41):**  librarian, maritime engineer for over two years after I studied maritime  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:46):**  engineering in Seattle. Now I first got interested in self-sustainability skills  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:51):**  quite a few years back which quickly led to studying permaculture and natural  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:01:56):**  building. I first worked on permaculture farms through the organization WOOF  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:00):**  which is spelled W W O O F which is worldwide opportunities on organic farms  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:06):**  and that organization was really instrumental for me seeing all the  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:11):**  different ways that people can provide for their own needs on different types  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:15):**  of land and in different ecosystems. So I started doing that first in New  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:19):**  Zealand, have been volunteering on farms in Australia, California, Morocco and  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:26):**  quite a few other places as well. Now during that time I also did a lot of  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:30):**  research just for fun on natural building and other ways of creating  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:35):**  shelter. That research eventually led me to read The Hand Sculpted House which was  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:39):**  written by Ianto Evans, Linda Smiley and Michael Reynolds. I was lucky to have  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:45):**  read that at a really good time because back then I was living in Portland,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:48):**  Oregon and the Cobb Cottage Company is just located a few hours south of there  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:53):**  and I was able to visit them after setting up meeting and participating in  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:02:58):**  one of their work parties. While I was there I got to meet Ianto and Linda and  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:03):**  talk to them about opportunities of getting more involved and learning more  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:07):**  about Cobb and other natural building practices. After that work party I went  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:12):**  to Guatemala for a couple of months to study Spanish and dance but when I came  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:16):**  back I immediately started the apprenticeship program and took my first  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:20):**  ever natural building workshop with a fantastic teacher named Betty Seaman in  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:26):**  Southern California. After finishing that workshop I went back up north to the Cobb  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:31):**  Cottage Company site and took an advanced workshop there learning how to  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:35):**  remodel bale Cobb, fix roof systems, build ovens and and drop schematics and learn  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:42):**  how to work off-grid water and energy systems. From there I went and did even  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:48):**  more studying with one of my favorite teachers Carol Cruz a plaster and  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:53):**  natural finishes expert based out of Taos New Mexico. I stayed with her for a  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:03:58):**  while and we worked on a couple of plaster and remodel jobs for clients in  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:02):**  that area before going to Ecuador where I worked as a volunteer helping a family  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:08):**  to start a small cow house doing the designs and sourcing materials in the  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:13):**  Andes Mountains in the northern part of the country. After finishing my  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:17):**  apprenticeship I took freelance work for a number of years building things like  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:21):**  ovens, doing remodels, interior and exterior plaster jobs and eventually was  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:26):**  contracted to build my first home independently in the Philippines. After  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:31):**  finishing that project I went on to build three houses in Senegal for a  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:36):**  couple of clients from Holland. Two of the houses were done in Cobb and one was  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:40):**  done in Adobe which surrounded a steel frame structure after I talked the  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:44):**  client out of using cement block and instead replacing it with earth. I'm  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:48):**  currently now in Guatemala studying with Charlie Rendell the owner of Return to  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:53):**  the Forest and a bamboo specialist here. So I'm constantly learning constantly  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:04:58):**  looking for new instructors and new teachers to help me to increase my skill  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:02):**  and my experience. Honestly I've benefited so much from all the generosity  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:07):**  of my teachers, hosts and especially the online community. Between natural  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:11):**  building and permaculture the online community is one of the most supportive  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:16):**  I've seen in any subject. People are constantly sharing information, ideas,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:21):**  schematics, experiences and all for free. That's been one of my biggest inspirations  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:27):**  for starting this podcast. I really want to contribute my part to this online  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:31):**  community from which I have benefited from so much. Now I chose the name  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:38):**  Abundant Edge because of a concept in biology that I find really interesting  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:42):**  which is called the edge effect. What the edge effect is is when you have two  
**[0:05:46-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:46):**  dissimilar ecosystems such as plains or grasslands and a forest or the ocean and  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:05:55):**  the beach for example. The edge that we're talking about here is where these  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:00):**  two ecosystems meet. Now in each ecosystem there is a unique set of flora  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:07):**  and fauna. Animals and plants that exist only in that ecosystem are only  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:12):**  comfortable there. On these edges you have the plants and animals that exist  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:18):**  on both sides but also a whole new mix of plants and animals that exist in  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:25):**  these margins. These margins host all sorts of wildlife that cannot exist in  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:32):**  one or the other ecosystem alone. These convergences that create an abundance of  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:38):**  life and that's where the abundant edge name comes from. This is exactly what  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:42):**  I'm hoping that the podcast will be as well. It'll be an edge between all of  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:47):**  these different practices natural building, permaculture, regenerative  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:51):**  living, recycling, DIY, whatever it is. The convergence of all of these  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:06:57):**  different practices is going to inspire more people to come up with ideas and  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:04):**  solutions for whatever problems that they're facing in their life, whatever  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:07):**  challenges they're trying to meet and run with the new ideas. Hopefully it'll  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:12):**  help you to complete your projects better, reach your goals faster and  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:15):**  achieve your dreams for a regenerative lifestyle. Now every day I'm inspired by  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:21):**  the people who contribute so generously to the forums, blogs, video channels and  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:25):**  other platforms in the natural building, permaculture and other  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:29):**  regenerative living practices. Here in this podcast we're going to cover a  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:33):**  really wide range of skills, specialties and experience in the interviews and  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:38):**  also in some special episodes. All of them come from a place of building a  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:44):**  regenerative future for our planet. That's the thing that they have in  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:47):**  common. Whether it's appropriate technology, skills for self-sufficiency  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:52):**  or making good use of resources that we have at hand, all of  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:07:57):**  these interviews and special episodes on specific topics are aimed at helping you  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:02):**  to improve your life while we all improve the life of this planet. That's  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:06):**  the goal. More than anything this is meant to be a discussion, this is meant  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:10):**  to be a dialogue. None of these episodes are lectures or speeches but they're  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:14):**  meant to provoke interaction. Feel free to correct any of my mistakes.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:18):**  There's undoubtedly going to be a ton of them, especially in these early episodes  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:23):**  while I'm still figuring out my equipment and working on getting the  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:27):**  highest quality of audio and frankly of interviews to you at just in these early  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:33):**  stages. There's going to be a huge learning curve and I'm fully aware of  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:37):**  that. But by all means, correct my mistakes, offer feedback, fill in  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:42):**  information that I missed, add to the conversation and we'll all make these  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:47):**  bigger than the sum of their parts. We'll make these better than certainly I could  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:51):**  do on my own. So you can read more on all of these topics and see pictures from my  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:08:56):**  projects like I said in my previous work. It's all on abundantedge.com. And I  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:09:01):**  want to thank you so much for being a part of this incredible community. All of  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:09:05):**  you who have contributed like I said on forums, on YouTube channels, on social  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:09:09):**  media have been a huge inspiration to me and I'm just trying to you know sort of  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:09:14):**  give back my part to the information and the quality of dialogue that all of you  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:09:20):**  have started already. Again, thank you so much and I look forward to seeing you on  
**[0:09:25-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:09:25):**  the next episode.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-001rqintroducing/#t=0:09:55):**  you

**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:01):**  I decided to focus on the conclusion of the Carbon Farming Solution Part 5 which outlines  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:06):**  the implementation of regenerative, mainly perennial-based agriculture.

**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:16):**  ways to support farmers and organizations in the transition, effective financing, removing  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:22):**  policy barriers, as well as strategic next steps.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:25):**  We also cover some of his work with Project Drawdown in looking at the global picture  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:30):**  and where regenerative agriculture stacks up in the priority list they've created

**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:36):**  There's so much more I could say in an introduction to Eric and his work, but instead I'll put  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:41):**  all the links to learn more about him and the projects he's involved with in the show

**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:50):**  off.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:52):**  The book outlines very thorough strategies for many of the different farming methods  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:02:56):**  and how they can be adapted to sequester massive amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, but  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:01):**  just as importantly that carbon can be cycled in a way that rebuilds topsoil that we've  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:06):**  lost in order to improve much of, or go beyond just the improvement of atmospheric conditions  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:12):**  and, you know, work to reestablish healthy hydrological cycles and many other functions.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:19):**  So instead of going through all the perennial cropping and other agricultural practices  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:23):**  that you recommend in the earlier chapters, I want to focus on the content of that last  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:27):**  chapter focusing on a roadmap to implementation.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:31):**  So perhaps we could start by going over the three step plan to scale up carbon farming.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:36):**  Well, here's what I think is first, is first we want to distinguish between the sort of  
**[0:03:44-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:44):**  phase one practices that are ready to scale now or that are already scaling that we know  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:52):**  everything we need to know how to do it we've measured their impacts.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:03:57):**  They are already being adopted on their own things like better grazing, for example, or  
**[0:04:03-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:03):**  cover cropping, and so on, practices that have a real track record of success.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:13):**  Great.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:14):**  So that's phase one is sort of go all in on those to me, we want those to take off.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:22):**  And there's a million things we can do around those and we can talk more about that but  
**[0:04:25-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:25):**  then there's also this phase two practices that are maybe a decade or two out from being  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:33):**  ready to be widely adopted and that might be because they're being adapted to a different  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:39):**  climate, it might be because they're sort of still new enough that they just haven't  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:45):**  got traction and momentum for for being picked up, or it might be because there's still things  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:52):**  that haven't been figured out like perennial grains, kind of don't really exist yet, it's  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:04:57):**  a minor problem for their adoption.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:00):**  So we know what to do with them and when they are ready.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:04):**  We already have a system that can take grains and know what to do with them in a really  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:10):**  big way.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:11):**  It doesn't require any changes to processing or transport or diet or livestock feed or  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:16):**  anything, or even changes to equipment for harvesting.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:22):**  We just have to do the breeding part.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:25):**  So, that would be one example of a phase two system, another would be the mechanized alley  
**[0:05:33-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:33):**  cropping agroforestry systems which are being done on a scale in Europe, something like  
**[0:05:42-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:42):**  maybe 1% of farmland there or something but hardly huge, you know, that have very, very  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:51):**  powerful carbon impacts, but there's a number of things to be worked out before they're  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:05:58):**  ready to sort of take over all cropland.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:03):**  So that's the first distinction I try and make is between what's kind of ready and it's  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:06):**  not that we don't need to throw a bunch of money at the research and development and  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:11):**  at the demonstration centers and farmer training and all that on these kind of like farther  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:17):**  out projects.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:20):**  But meanwhile, we can be going ahead much more aggressively if every farmer isn't using  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:24):**  cover crops yet.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:25):**  Well, certainly that's a very achievable and doable goal.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:30):**  And there's a bunch of different approaches to doing that which we lay out in this chapter  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:34):**  sort of what's the private sector part and what's the finance part and what's the university  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:39):**  part and government part and so on.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:41):**  So you can sort of steer me where you want on that.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:46):**  Also in implementing these things on a larger scale, like you were talking about, what are  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:51):**  the best support mechanisms for farmers to make their transition?  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:06:55):**  Because this is something that I'm very directly related to in my work.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:00):**  I'm working with our groups of farmers through Climate Farmers and coming up with curriculum  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:05):**  and coaching and support services remotely to help them in their transition process.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:10):**  But it's definitely not a one size fits all.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:12):**  What are the things that you've identified that can really assist in this process?  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:17):**  Sure.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:19):**  Well, first, I'll say I don't really believe in like any one answer like you were just  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:25):**  saying to doing this.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:26):**  I feel like we need a whole constellation of different efforts because different farms  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:30):**  are going to need different things.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:33):**  And we want that sort of redundant backup system to really make it go if we want to  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:38):**  transform agriculture at the speed that is required, it's going to require effort and  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:46):**  coordination and budget and all that.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:48):**  So one of the ways to think about it is to think about what to ask, what are the challenges  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:07:56):**  that farmers face in order to adopt a certain practice?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:01):**  And I'll say, as I say in the book, and as I'm sure you know very well, none of the practice  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:08):**  practices that people are talking about right now, at least in terms of carbon sequestration,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:13):**  none of them were developed because of their impact on climate.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:17):**  They were developed because they make the farm more resilient because they make the  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:21):**  farm more profitable, or in a few cases for some kind of ecosystem services of some kind  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:27):**  like water quality impacts or things like that.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:30):**  But the great majority of these practices were developed because they are good for the  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:35):**  farmer.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:36):**  So you might ask why are farmers not adopting them more rapidly?  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:42):**  One of the reasons that the sort of policy level is, broadly speaking, we're still funding  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:48):**  all the wrong practices everywhere.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:52):**  So that's a lot of momentum and weight to try and shift.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:08:56):**  I think globally, there was a study a few years ago that global agricultural subsidies  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:01):**  are around $700 billion a year, and about 1% of those were for environmentally friendly  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:08):**  practices of one kind or another.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:10):**  So there's a piece of like, remove the subsidizing of the bad and that frees up some budget for  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:18):**  the good, just to talk about it in a very basic kind of way.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:25):**  So what are the reasons that farmers have trouble adopting things?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:29):**  But one is they may not find out about them because nobody's encouraging them to learn  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:33):**  about them, or because there are policies that actually make it impossible to do those  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:38):**  things or illegal to do those things in many cases.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:43):**  Two is they may not, it may require money in order to adopt those practices.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:53):**  Some are free, which is fantastic.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:55):**  There are quite a number of practices that don't cost farmers anything with the great  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:09:58):**  majority of these practices cost money.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:01):**  There's at least an initial investment, and in some cases there's an annual ongoing costs  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:05):**  like cover cropping every year, you'd have to buy those seeds and so on.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:12):**  Then there's the risk to farms of all the things that can go wrong, especially in those  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:18):**  kind of years of working the bugs out of adopting a new practice, which is sometimes literally  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:23):**  working the bugs out, the pest insects out.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:28):**  Even with something that we know so much about as converting to organic, let's say, there's  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:35):**  still regularly this two to three year period where there's going to be a dip in profitability  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:40):**  and productivity on that farm.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:44):**  And the farther you go afield into newer practices that are less familiar in your area, the more  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:50):**  that's going to be a challenge.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:10:54):**  And I'll add that in most cases, not always, but broadly speaking, the more powerful the  
**[0:11:01-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:01):**  practice in terms of the impact per acre or impact per hectare, the more costs and the  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:09):**  more years until it pays off.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:13):**  There are again exceptions, but generally speaking, that's the rule, especially when  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:16):**  trees are involved.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:19):**  And which brings us to another big area of challenge for farmers, which is tenure.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:24):**  When you're renting land, why would you install terraces or put in a water harvesting system  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:32):**  or plant a bunch of trees or any number of these other kinds of things you might do that  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:39):**  take time to pay off.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:40):**  Cover crops are nice because they're relatively quick and that's something that you will see  
**[0:11:44-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:44):**  an impact relatively quickly and that can make more sense on rented land.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:54):**  So there are a whole suite of challenges that people are facing that are keeping them from  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:11:59):**  being able to adopt these practices.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:02):**  But I do think in many ways the mindset is one of the biggest ones.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:06):**  And if your university and your seed suppliers and fertilizer suppliers or whatever have  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:13):**  been telling you and your government perhaps have been telling you for years, cut down  
**[0:12:18-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:18):**  every tree, plow it up from fence row to fence row, here's heavily subsidized fertilizer,  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:27):**  go crazy with it, things like that.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:31):**  Keep your animals separate from your crops, whatever else that you need to hear some other  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:39):**  voices.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:43):**  And while I do think the regenerative ag movement has been doing a really great job of getting  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:46):**  some other ideas out there, it's still a fairly slow process.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:51):**  It's not at all on track for that sort of well enough.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:12:58):**  So you were talking about this multifaceted look at the transition needed to happen and  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:04):**  how there are a lot of hurdles in the way.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:05):**  And one of those major ones and is fairly significant across all spectrums is the need  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:13):**  for financing.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:14):**  That it needs to happen in an increasingly short time window that we're working with,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:19):**  climatically speaking.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:20):**  Where is this money going to come from and where can it be effectively directed?  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:24):**  Because there's a lot of debate over that as well.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:27):**  Well that you're really demonstrating that you are aware of the issues in here because  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:35):**  let's start with the word as it get directed first.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:38):**  Most of the kind of bigger avenues for finance are accustomed to working with, to providing  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:46):**  that to places that can handle tens of millions of dollars at a time.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:51):**  And rare are the farms who can do that, although they exist, there are very few of them.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:13:59):**  So I see one of the big challenges being aggregating farmers to be able to receive these kinds  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:07):**  of funds in the first place, just to be able to get the financing in the first place.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:10):**  And we do have models for that, like producer cooperatives are very commonly used in agriculture  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:18):**  already for grains or whatever.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:21):**  So there's sort of a precedent in that regard.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:24):**  And there are also various other kinds of producer associations, here in the US we have  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:30):**  the cranberry growers association and this and that.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:34):**  So there are various kinds of groups already of farmers in place, but they haven't mostly  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:40):**  been accustomed to funneling those kinds of funds.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:42):**  And we see that both in the global north, but also very much in the global south where  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:48):**  it's even a bigger deal because your average farm is just two hectares.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:53):**  So to be able to access those kinds of funds, in some cases you need to have 10,000 hectares  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:14:59):**  worth of land and either to be able to get in the door at all in the first place.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:04):**  And by the time you sort of administer that enough to get it out, you might be getting  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:09):**  a dollar a farm per year.

**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:18):**  That's not so true for government payment for environmental services.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:22):**  This is just one approach I really like, but certainly isn't and shouldn't be the only  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:26):**  approach to doing these things.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:27):**  So for various kinds of lending, that is a really key component.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:36):**  Another interesting way people have gone about this, and I know you know all this stuff and  
**[0:15:39-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:39):**  throw whatever stories in here that you like, is that the buyer financing has been surprisingly  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:47):**  effective and interesting so far where some of the big companies that purchase products  
**[0:15:53-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:15:53):**  from farmers would really like to be able to buy the most regenerative or more regenerative  
**[0:16:02-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:02):**  stuff and are providing funds, whether it's loans or outright payments, to farmers to  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:14):**  transition to the practices that those buyers would like to have.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:17):**  I'm thinking about companies like Danone in France who have pledged quite a bit of money  
**[0:16:24-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:24):**  for transition there, or here in the US, Annie's Mac and Cheese, which is part of General Mills,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:32):**  has pledged quite a bit of money for transition to organic wheat production in North Dakota  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:39):**  because they weren't able to get enough organic wheat to meet their demand.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:43):**  So I am seeing more of that than I thought.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:47):**  And that's interesting because they do already have a relationship with the farmers.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:50):**  So that sort of checks that box off and they have money to work with.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:56):**  And that's great.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:16:58):**  And so far, they're not asking huge changes from those farms.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:05):**  They're not sort of asking for radical overhauls of practices.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:10):**  They're looking at these kind of the lower hanging fruit, which I think is a very strategic  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:15):**  plan, although we don't want to ignore those higher carbon practices because we don't get  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:20):**  where we want to be in the carbon budget without them.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:24):**  But it in every way makes sense to start with the stuff that's easy for people to do.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:29):**  So those are my thoughts there.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:35):**  What else?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:36):**  Yeah, there's good stuff.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:37):**  There's so much that we can unpack about many of those things, including holding larger  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:41):**  industries accountable for actually seeing all these steps through and not just stopping  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:46):**  once they've made their marketing point, so to speak.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:49):**  And the way that the buyer side has really helped to drive a lot of these newer practices  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:55):**  and validate it from an economic standpoint.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:17:59):**  I know some of the growers that we work with who have become established and have good  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:05):**  marketing have switched over to direct marketing because there's enough people now who value  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:11):**  this and are willing to pay more for it and sometimes even create experiences around the  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:15):**  reconnection with their food more than just the purchase and consumption of it.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:20):**  And there are a lot of really inspiring and cool examples of this.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:24):**  But there are also a lot of invisible roadblocks in the ways of political or national restrictions,  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:34):**  incentives like we kind of touched on before, and also opposition from large industrial  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:39):**  giants who sometimes will greenwash what it is they're actually doing, whereas their relationships  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:45):**  with the farms and what they're incentivizing on the grower side does not actually square  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:49):**  with that.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:50):**  So I'm wondering, where do you see hope in overcoming these issues?  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:54):**  Well, it's generous of you to think that I see hope, but I certainly see hopeful things  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:18:58):**  here and there anyway, for sure.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:03):**  Well we certainly didn't, you know, 20, 30 years ago when I got started in this kind  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:11):**  of agriculture before I was aware in any way of the climate part, right, and back when  
**[0:19:16-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:16):**  we called it sustainable agriculture, that we never thought that any of those big companies  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:24):**  were going to be interested at all.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:27):**  So it is surprising and pleasing to see them talking about things like cover cropping and  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:33):**  reducing tillage and integrating livestock and all that.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:36):**  That is really new to see those places doing that.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:39):**  So that itself is hopeful.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:43):**  My personal focus is often more on the farmers who are going into the higher carbon end of  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:53):**  things, the sort of more aggressively high carbon end of things.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:19:58):**  And what I'm seeing there in agroforestry, for example, which is where a lot of my work  
**[0:20:03-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:03):**  is sitting right now, just an explosive wave of farmers picking up agroforestry practices,  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:13):**  similar in many ways to what organic looked like in the 1990s.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:18):**  Just stuff that they all want to do all of a sudden.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:23):**  And that is very, very encouraging because really it falls to the farmers ultimately  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:27):**  to sequester that carbon.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:29):**  The rest of us do what we can to help them do it.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:32):**  So the fact that there are a number of them who are interested is very exciting.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:37):**  And I am seeing some national governments really putting some emphasis on these things.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:43):**  France, for example, has made a pretty big commitment to stepping up on alley cropping,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:50):**  for example.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:51):**  France is really currently the world leader in temperate climate alley cropping.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:56):**  China held that role in the 80s and that sort of fell away.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:20:59):**  So they've got some pretty robust targets, not remotely enough for what we need in terms  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:07):**  of climate, but very ambitious targets in terms of growing the amount of alley cropping  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:14):**  that's happening there.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:15):**  That is really exciting to see.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:19):**  And I think the EU is looking pretty strong on nutrient management, which is kind of the  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:26):**  least sexy of any of these practices.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:29):**  But the nitrous oxide from fertilizers, not to mention the carbon dioxide that is emitted  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:34):**  from the manufacturing of synthetic fertilizers, is a really, really big contributor to climate  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:40):**  change.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:41):**  And if we're able to, and it's something that can be, that an action this year makes an  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:48):**  impact this year.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:51):**  Carbon sequestering may take decades to really kick in from today's actions and have to be  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:56):**  maintained that whole time.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:21:58):**  But reducing nitrous oxide is right now.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:02):**  So I am seeing a lot of enthusiasm about that in the US and Canada as well.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:08):**  Not enough and not with enough teeth in the regulations maybe, but I'm seeing a lot of  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:14):**  interest in that.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:16):**  And it is something that saves farmers money to just stop overusing synthetic fertilizer  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:22):**  must be the most basic step you can take is to stop wasting money on something you're  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:28):**  over applying that isn't even helping your crops at all.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:33):**  So that's good.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:34):**  I think strategically that is where that one belongs is right in there with the cover crops  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:39):**  and if you can reduce tillage and stuff, I think that's good news.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:45):**  What I like to see coming in after that, and we are seeing a lot more interest on that  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:52):**  here in the States and in Europe through like the Ag Forward initiative and stuff, is the  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:22:58):**  bringing of trees and perennials around the edges of the farm.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:03):**  So the wind breaks, the riparian buffers and plantings.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:09):**  Getting those trees around the edges of the fields is a good step.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:12):**  After that comes coming actually into the field along the contours if you're in a slope  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:17):**  with strips of things.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:18):**  Here in the US there's been quite a lot of uptake of perennial grass strips on contour  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:26):**  within fields.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:28):**  So it's not the most dramatic, exciting thing, but it's sort of an entering wedge to actually  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:33):**  get perennials into the field.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:36):**  That's a great step.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:38):**  And then from there that kind of final step is to bring those rows of trees into the fields  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:43):**  until such time as perennial grains or perennial whatever else are available.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:47):**  That's the most you can perennialize the field and that's the most carbon you can get in  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:52):**  a crop field to my knowledge.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:23:57):**  And with grazing similarly, you start with the whatever optimizing your stocking rates  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:04):**  and whatever and you move into more and more sophisticated and managed grazing systems.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:10):**  But adding trees to those systems greatly increases carbon sequestration and in some  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:16):**  cases can reduce emissions as well.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:22):**  When ruminants consume the leaves of many kinds of trees, it reduces methane because  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:30):**  the tannins somehow affect the microbes in the ruminant.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:36):**  So that's a pretty exciting thing as well.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:40):**  And actually we're seeing in the sort of livestock feed world a lot of interest in these methane  
**[0:24:46-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:46):**  reducing feeds as well, which again, maybe sort of like a bandaid on a broken system  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:54):**  to some degree, but also that methane is a problem.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:24:58):**  And if we can find ways of doing it that don't harm the animals, because some of the things  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:03):**  that have been proposed are actually harmful to the animals.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:07):**  And if we can prove that doing so has a long term effect and not just during a couple of  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:12):**  weeks of a study, which I don't think has really quite been shown yet, that could be  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:18):**  a big deal.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:19):**  And I think what we're going to see a lot of uptake on that.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:21):**  I've certainly seen a lot of interest in like the seaweeds and things like that as feed  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:26):**  additives, which is again, something farmers have been doing for thousands of years.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:31):**  So a lot of these aren't actually new practices.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:34):**  They're just, we're realizing again, what a good idea it is to graze livestock in your  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:41):**  orchard or feed some seaweed to your livestock or have your livestock have a diverse diet  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:48):**  of fresh forages, which also reduces methane from emissions.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:25:55):**  If they're eating nice tender forage and if it has some, there are certain kinds of methane  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:02):**  reducing forages as well, like some of the plantains and things like that.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:09):**  So we're just, this is all just sort of percolating up, but I do see a lot of interest there and  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:14):**  it's pretty easy for a farmer to add another kind of seed or two to their seed mix when  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:18):**  they're redoing a field or something, right, or frost seeding something in.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:26):**  Relatively easy to do that compared to other things.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:28):**  So those are some of the hopeful things that I see.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:33):**  And I also see, which we really, we didn't see 10 years ago, real consumer interest in  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:39):**  these climate friendly production practices and climate friendly types of foods.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:45):**  Although there's a lot of confusion out there about that.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:51):**  So I think we are going to increasingly see demand for things that are produced in a climate  
**[0:26:58-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:26:58):**  friendly way and some premium prices or access to premium markets, which is another way to  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:06):**  finance farmers transition is just to offer them a place to sell things.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:12):**  Even if it doesn't have a better price, and I'm just getting in the door to a market at  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:15):**  all is enough, but certainly a better price.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:20):**  There's people looking at different kinds of certification systems around that, all  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:24):**  of which seem to have their limitations and stuff, but that's another possible approach  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:29):**  is these.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:32):**  Like Kiss the Ground put out a buyer guide a couple of years ago that was really interesting  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:37):**  and talked about a whole range of different kinds of misinformation and there's a lot  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:41):**  that isn't known.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:43):**  So how can you have anything but misinformation about things that nobody really understands  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:47):**  yet?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:48):**  So there's a lot of nuance that isn't always communicated easily.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:52):**  And I think so there's a lot of confusing messages, I think going around about that  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:58):**  kind of stuff right now.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:27:59):**  Yeah, this is kind of par for the course as this is still new and emerging all the time.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:05):**  And as new information comes out, people gravitate to a simplistic solution based on some side  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:13):**  of scientific study or whatnot.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:14):**  And it's very easy to lose sight of the hole, which really is the mindset change that needs  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:19):**  to happen for these things to stick.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:21):**  Otherwise, we're just going to find the newest solution that is shinier and a little bit  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:26):**  better than the previous one and pursue that to such a level that it becomes destructive  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:30):**  as well, which is very easy to do on a planet of 8 billion people.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:36):**  So now I've always kind of come back to your work for your focus on perennial plants and  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:43):**  the massive amount of potential of not only nutrition and variety of diet, but the way  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:50):**  that it makes land management that much simpler, despite it being somewhat more complex.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:28:56):**  I know that's perhaps paradoxical in description, but by simply not having to work the soil  
**[0:29:02-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:02):**  every season, there opens up a lot of new management possibilities and a very different  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:10):**  diet, tradition of working the land, reconnecting with cultures that used to cultivate these  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:17):**  foods and of course, all of the ecological benefits as well.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:22):**  Where do you see the real full potential of this being rolled out or is there still enough  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:27):**  pushback from large grain producers and the fact that so many of us have grown up and  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:32):**  only known these grain-based diets that it's just hard to imagine anything different?  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:39):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:42):**  In many areas of the tropics, perennial agriculture has already realized its potential.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:49):**  Generally on a small holder kind of a scale or a diverse mosaic of smaller farmers kind  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:29:58):**  of scale, but there are places where breadfruit and bananas and so on are really actually  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:04):**  staple foods for people in a big way right now.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:10):**  But the sort of annual agriculture model has been imposed as a result of policy and economic  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:16):**  things and stuff on many of those places.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:18):**  So there's less in some ways than there was, but there's still quite a bit there.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:24):**  In terms of places doing really mechanized agriculture and stuff, well, actually there's  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:30):**  an interesting model coming out of Brazil.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:32):**  This centropic agriculture is a multi-strata agroforestry practice that has sort of begun  
**[0:30:39-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:39):**  to crack the code on mechanized establishment and ergonomic efficiency without losing the  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:48):**  diversity in the ecosystem services and stuff.

**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:30:54):**  Let's see.

**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:31:31):**  think the world is poised for that to take off when those come.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:31:35):**  And in particular, I think the application for those kinds of, let's say, perennial grains,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:31:42):**  for example, or even the agroforestry systems or other kinds of perennial crops is on the  
**[0:31:48-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:31:48):**  marginal land because only about a third of the world's cropland is prime, like flat and  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:31:58):**  fertile, which are the most forgiving lands if you want to be plowing a lot.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:32:03):**  That's where you want to do it.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:32:06):**  That leaves two thirds that is less fertile or steep or otherwise, or even relatively  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:32:14):**  gently sloping can still be bad for erosion or just otherwise vulnerable to degradation.

**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:32:23):**  Okay, we do the best annuals we can on the flat fertile places, right, do rotation and  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:32:29):**  cover crops and blah, blah, blah, great, and some perennial stuff around the edges of the  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:32:33):**  fields and whatnot.

**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:32:59):**  or anything.

**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:33:08):**  Just to talk about Europe in particular, Europe in general and France in particular, a relatively

**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:33:46):**  What here in the US, there's some interesting developments, there's been quite a bit of  
**[0:33:50-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:33:50):**  interest and investment in developing hazelnuts and chestnuts as new specialty crops, but  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:01):**  ultimately with the eye towards them becoming new staple crops down the road.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:07):**  So there was, I think there's maybe $5 million has been thrown at developing hazelnuts as  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:12):**  a new crop for the Midwest and there's similar kind of stuff starting to happen around chestnuts.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:18):**  If you were to compare that to work being done on corn, it would be a very small amount  
**[0:34:25-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:25):**  of money, but compared to what we've seen here before, it's a big deal anyway.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:33):**  And there is quite a bit of interest in silvopasture, both in Europe and the US, I think Europe  
**[0:34:41-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:41):**  gets more points for looking at those leaves of trees as fodder for the livestock.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:50):**  I'm seeing that happening in a pretty exciting way.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:55):**  And I think Europe also in general, Niagara forestry is doing better thinking about the  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:34:59):**  trees as timber.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:35:02):**  I think because there are just less forests in Europe that you have to grow, if you want  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:35:06):**  good timber, you have to grow it.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:35:08):**  Whereas here it's there, you could just go cut down more trees in the wild.

**[0:35:30-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:35:30):**  where they plant these fodder shrubs, nitrogen fixing fodder shrubs, very, very close together,  
**[0:35:38-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:35:38):**  like one foot apart on center through the whole paddock and plant them with very productive  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:35:45):**  pasture grasses.

**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:35:52):**  move on.

**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:35:56):**  It's the same basic kind of thing, but the carbon sequestration is greatly increased.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:01):**  The high tannins reduce the methane emissions quite a bit.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:06):**  They're often using brachioria grasses as the grass, which reduce nitrous oxide emissions  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:13):**  from urine from livestock.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:16):**  And then they're often planting rows of trees, timber trees and stuff in the fields, and  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:24):**  also sometimes various other kinds of useful palms and fruit trees and trees that make  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:29):**  food for the livestock.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:30):**  So they're getting these incredibly high carbon sequestration rates.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:34):**  I think it's really the most efficient, the most carbon friendly way to raise beef and

**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:52):**  certain number of kilos of milk or meat is the same as what feedlots take to grow all  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:36:59):**  the grain for them.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:00):**  The argument against managed grazing has been great.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:02):**  You're sequestering carbon, but you take two or three times more land than a feedlot and  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:07):**  the corn and grains that are associated with it.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:11):**  So okay, you're sequestering carbon, but you're taking up more land, which means you're helping  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:15):**  to drive deforestation or prevent reforestation.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:19):**  Here's a practice where you really can't bring that criticism to it in any way.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:25):**  And it's taking off like wildfire through Latin America.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:27):**  And there are, you can't do it quite like that in the temper world because those species  
**[0:37:34-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:34):**  won't grow here, but there are all kinds of things, trees and shrubs that do similar things

**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:46):**  That it's very exciting to see that starting to take.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:50):**  And I think that could be a big, that could be a big deal here as well.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:37:54):**  But it's in terms of movements where these very perennial systems have been taking off.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:01):**  That's quite an exciting one to me.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:04):**  We do have a perennial rice.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:06):**  The first perennial rice variety is doing great.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:09):**  I think it's in the fifth year and continuing to produce competitively with annuals.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:15):**  That's again, not a super help in Spain maybe, but rice is a big crop around the world.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:23):**  And there are some sorghums that have been released in Ethiopia recently that look pretty  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:27):**  good.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:29):**  So we're really, for most of my life, we talked about when perennial grains exist.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:35):**  And now we're in the period where those first perennial grains are out there.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:39):**  And that's not that there haven't maybe been some historic perennial grains here and there,  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:45):**  don't get me wrong, but at a functional level, they're mostly of historic interest only rather  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:52):**  than things people are, like a lot of Australia had perennial grains that were cultivated  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:38:56):**  of various kinds and certain parts of the Western US had a few.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:01):**  There were a few in temperate South America, but basically those are more or less gone  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:05):**  and the varieties have been lost and stuff.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:08):**  So that's an exciting time.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:13):**  There is also a lot of interest here in the US at least on converting cropland to grazing  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:22):**  land.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:23):**  And that is complex because on the one hand, it's this marginal land that isn't great for  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:29):**  annuals anyway, right?  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:31):**  That's highly erodible or whatever.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:32):**  So it shouldn't be in annuals, but there is sometimes an approach to that that says, this  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:38):**  is the only thing you can do with that, which is not true.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:41):**  There are other things you can do with that land.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:43):**  You could do agroforestry or whatever, an orchard or something, or biomass crops or  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:51):**  perennial industrial feedstocks or something.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:39:54):**  But also the challenge there is that even a well-managed beef operation or whatever,  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:02):**  grazing operation is going to make about 10% as much food as if that land was still growing  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:07):**  corn and soybeans or something.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:10):**  So if we convert a whole lot of that land to that, there's a problem with food supply  
**[0:40:16-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:16):**  at the global level.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:17):**  For the individual farmer, that doesn't matter at all and they need to do what's right for  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:21):**  them and for their land and for their soil and stuff.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:25):**  But if everybody were to do that with all of the grain land of the world, there would  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:30):**  be a very big problem with the amount of food available.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:34):**  That would be a big problem.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:35):**  So I see why people do it and I think that for many individual pieces of land, that's  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:42):**  a really great approach that makes really good sense.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:46):**  But we do need to figure out how to raise plant-based foods on those lands that are  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:53):**  less than perfect.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:40:57):**  And I would like to see, and I think people have been switching to these kinds of fancy  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:03):**  grazing and grazing and stuff there because it makes good economic sense for them.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:08):**  And because they're not being presented with other things they might do there instead.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:13):**  And I'm not opposed in any way to that kind of grazing.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:15):**  I think it's lovely and elegant and sophisticated and fascinating and stuff.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:22):**  But we can't do that with all of that cropland or we have a problem as well.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:29):**  So that's where the kind of nuance gets into this.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:32):**  Like is grass-fed beef always better than, I don't know, if you're eating beef, it should  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:39):**  be that kind of beef probably.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:41):**  Don't come across well on Twitter or whatever, I guess, when you try and communicate about  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:49):**  this stuff.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:52):**  Sort of the like eat less meat and have it be raised in the best way possible seems as  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:56):**  close to that as I've seen.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:41:58):**  But even that is, well, that really depends on some things.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:03):**  Or even within fisheries, there's the same aquaculture, there's the same kinds of challenges  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:07):**  as well.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:08):**  It really depends on what kind and how it's raised and what it's replacing, if anything,  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:15):**  and all of that.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:17):**  Scallops and oysters look pretty good.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:21):**  Shrimp looks really terrible.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:25):**  So there's a lot to be said there.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:31):**  All right.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:32):**  What else?  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:33):**  Well, I love this acknowledgement of the nuances necessary in deciding on what management  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:37):**  practice, what crop is correct for every different scenario.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:41):**  And this is something that I've been involved with for a long time.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:44):**  In the last five years, I've helped to work with indigenous growers in the highlands of  
**[0:42:48-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:48):**  Guatemala where I used to live to integrate more overstory crops and soil building perennials  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:42:56):**  in with the coffee growing systems.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:00):**  We've also helped to revive traditional avocado varieties that don't have as much value on  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:06):**  the market but are honestly much higher quality than most of the ones that you would get at  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:10):**  a market.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:12):**  All the way to like, even you were talking about perennial rice and I live, you'd be  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:16):**  surprised in two directions, I live less than two hours away from traditional rice growing  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:21):**  areas here in Spain.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:24):**  And there's unique kind of pockets where those things are possible.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:29):**  But also seeing the terraced fields and as you start to go into the mountains that have  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:33):**  been worked since Roman times.

**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:42):**  agroforestry course coming up here in the spring.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:46):**  And knowing that we can't just take a method that was developed in Brazil and a wholesale  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:53):**  copy and paste it over here into the Mediterranean, that there needs to be adaptations, not only  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:43:59):**  in the different species that we would cultivate, but also understanding the difference in rainfall,  
**[0:44:03-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:03):**  soil types and everything.

**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:10):**  need to have a fundamental understanding of your context, your business model, the market  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:14):**  you're selling to, the labor pool that you're working with, and so many other factors.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:19):**  And so making recommendations in a prescriptive way is always going to end in failure without  
**[0:44:26-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:26):**  a nuanced understanding.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:27):**  And that's something that I've always kind of got from your work and from the books that  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:31):**  you've put out.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:32):**  So I guess the next question would be, since you started working with Project Drawdown  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:37):**  and looking at a very broad array of climate solutions in different industries, as well  
**[0:44:43-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:43):**  as social issues, farming is and different types of farming are very high up on those  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:50):**  lists.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:51):**  But there are other things as well.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:53):**  And sometimes it's easy to just narrow it down to like, yeah, we need to fix the farming  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:44:57):**  system and then we will solve the world's problems.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:00):**  But this broader understanding of the fact that there are other priorities happening  
**[0:45:06-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:06):**  in other places and there are more urgent solutions that need to take place so that  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:10):**  they get to a level of comfort or privilege that dealing with ecological issues becomes  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:17):**  a possibility.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:18):**  You know, you have to start from these lower necessities as you build up to higher actualization.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:25):**  In understanding this, where are some other things that can kind of be paired with land  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:30):**  management practices for a better result overall?  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:35):**  That is a great question.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:37):**  Well, I think one of the, Drawdown has a team working right now and I think should have  
**[0:45:44-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:44):**  some time out, maybe even this year, a whole suite of solutions around oceans.

**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:45:58):**  A lot of our food comes from the ocean, less and less all the time in terms of fish as

**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:24):**  that.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:25):**  And of course, as the livestock feed.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:26):**  So what happens in the oceans really matters a lot.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:30):**  There's a whole set of things there.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:31):**  And then there's the land restoration, the ecosystem restoration work, which is really  
**[0:46:38-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:38):**  critical as well.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:40):**  And you've worked in the restoration camps, right?  
**[0:46:44-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:44):**  It has such an impact on the farmland surrounding it in terms of if there's enough of it actually  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:52):**  can impact cloud formation and rainfall and stuff, but it impacts also water quality and  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:46:57):**  erosion farther down in the watershed and all that and biodiversity and pollinators  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:02):**  and all these other things that are very much related to agriculture in a very real way.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:07):**  And I think figuring out that kind of mosaic for any landscape, what parts to this landscape  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:13):**  should be restored, which parts should be in agriculture, which should be a sort of  
**[0:47:17-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:17):**  a hybrid fusion of those two things becomes a really interesting question.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:24):**  The farms in Columbia who've been doing this intensive still of a pasture, cattle grazing  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:31):**  is a huge part of life in Columbia.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:33):**  It's one of their biggest industries.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:35):**  And they've found that the farmers who adopt this intensive silver pastor are able to take  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:42):**  sometimes half of their pasture and reforest it because they're producing as much on half  
**[0:47:47-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:47):**  the land as they were on the whole thing before.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:51):**  So that adds another whole carbon impact, but also all the other benefits of timber  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:47:56):**  and fruits and nuts and all the other kinds of things that can be produced on that land.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:01):**  Sometimes it's reforestation, sometimes it's productive reforestation or some kind of agroforestry.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:08):**  So I would say that's really key.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:10):**  And then there's a bunch of things in the, so there's the oceans, there's the kind of  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:13):**  other land stuff, wetland restoration and care and protection of wetlands and stuff  
**[0:48:19-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:19):**  where most of our, so much of our carbon on land is actually in the wetlands.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:26):**  So preserving and maintaining and restoring those is really key.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:30):**  Then I would say the food system, the sort of supply chain is the other place where improvements  
**[0:48:39-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:39):**  in transportation and processing and refrigeration and reduction of waste all the way up to that  
**[0:48:47-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:47):**  consumer point are really key.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:50):**  And then reduction of waste and changing of diet at the consumer level is really big as  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:55):**  well.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:48:58):**  So those to me are the three things that really fit together best.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:01):**  I mean, all the other pieces of Drawdown are important, the buildings and transport and  
**[0:49:06-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:06):**  electricity, mostly, especially power generation, but all these other things are really essential.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:14):**  But to me, that sort of the food supply, the supply chain and demand, and then the terrestrial  
**[0:49:22-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:22):**  and wetland ecosystems and the oceans are really, they're so agriculture adjacent that  
**[0:49:30-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:30):**  they really have to be thought about together.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:33):**  And some places like mangroves where you really have the coming together of those two places  
**[0:49:40-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:40):**  are really key places with really key ecosystems with very high carbon sequestration that have  
**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:46):**  been heavily, heavily degraded and deforested.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:50):**  And there are some really interesting models of aqua forestry that restore mangroves with  
**[0:49:56-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:56):**  productive capacity of food.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:49:59):**  So I'm especially interested in those kinds of restoration that don't necessarily remove  
**[0:50:06-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:06):**  all food production potential from a piece of land like great, we need to restore peat  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:15):**  lands, but it doesn't always have to be done with pure forest restoration.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:19):**  There are all different kinds of ways people have found to restore peat lands with food  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:25):**  production or some other kind of products coming out of them that makes it economically  
**[0:50:29-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:29):**  viable for the people whose land it is to stay afloat, or to move forward in their lives.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:36):**  So because if you're just taking away people's livelihood, you need that kind of just transition  
**[0:50:43-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:43):**  component in there, or else it's not going to stick very well, or else you're just causing  
**[0:50:49-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:49):**  more human suffering anyway, which is not what the goal is, I think.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:54):**  No, ultimately, that's probably not it.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:50:58):**  So it really kind of comes down to something that has been very much a theme of this podcast  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:04):**  for five seasons now.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:05):**  And I've talked to so many people, and it really boils down to like, there are so many  
**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:08):**  ways to participate in this, by no means are we just talking about this is only something  
**[0:51:12-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:12):**  that farmers can do, and they're solely responsible for restoring the landscapes, I mean, from  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:19):**  the markets themselves, from the supply chains, from the energy production, all of those things  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:23):**  that you mentioned, there's an opportunity for everybody to take an active role in whatever  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:28):**  their specialty is, whatever their skill set is, whatever their passion is, and play their  
**[0:51:33-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:33):**  part in improving whatever it is that they have access to and participate in.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:40):**  And with that said, we're just about out of time here, Eric, can you tell our audience  
**[0:51:45-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:45):**  where they can find more of their work and get in touch with you?  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:48):**  Sure, let's see.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:50):**  They can Perennial Solutions is one of my is sort of my consultee website that's about  
**[0:51:56-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:56):**  to pick up.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:51:59):**  And the carbon farming solution is where I have the carbon farming stuff.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:52:04):**  I have a perennial agriculture dot Institute is a new NGO that I've got going.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:52:10):**  And actually, I will be launching a Patreon campaign any day now to provide some support  
**[0:52:16-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:52:16):**  for some of the writing I'm doing that I think is really important, but nobody seems to want  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:52:21):**  to.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:52:22):**  I haven't found the right home for yet.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:52:23):**  So that might be the way to do that.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/eric-toensmeier-outlines-the-roadmap-to-implementing-the-carbon-farming-solution/#t=0:52:27):**  Yeah.

**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:35):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:44):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:47):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:13):**  Alright, let me introduce you today to one of my favorite gurus of natural building.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:19):**  Conrad Rogue is the founder of House Alive and has been pioneering Cobb Building for  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:23):**  many years and is the author of House of Earth, a complete handbook for earthen construction.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:29):**  For over 15 years, House Alive has taught more than 1000 students how earthen building  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:33):**  materials can enhance and uplift our built environment in a simple and elegant way.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:38):**  I reached out to Conrad initially to commend him for an article he wrote called Cobb Speed.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:43):**  It beautifully deconstructs the comparisons between industrial and earthen buildings and  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:48):**  how the expectations of natural buildings are often very skewed.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:52):**  In this interview, I ask Conrad about the fundamental differences between green and  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:56):**  natural building.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:01:57):**  We go in depth about why it's essential to incorporate appropriate technology into  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:02):**  natural buildings in order to make them perform optimally.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:05):**  We go over the ever important process of passing your plans for building through the permitting  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:10):**  process and how to get the authorities to open up to progressive building ideas.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:15):**  So don't forget to check out the show notes on the Abundant Edge website for links on  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:19):**  the article on Cobb Speed.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:21):**  And without further ado, I'll turn things over to Conrad Rogue.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:24):**  Hey Conrad, how are you doing today?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:26):**  Thanks so much for taking the time to be on the podcast.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:29):**  I know you're on vacation right now.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:31):**  Tell us where you are.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:33):**  I'm in Yalapa, Mexico and I'm enduring a little R&R and nice sunshine and waves.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:41):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:42):**  You're actually not too far from where we are.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:45):**  You're in Guatemala, right?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:48):**  Well, hey, I've got a ton of questions for you.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:49):**  What do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:51):**  Yeah, let's go for it.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:53):**  All right.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:54):**  So let's start by having you tell us a little bit about your background and how you got  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:02:58):**  started in natural building.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:00):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:01):**  I'm originally from the Netherlands.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:02):**  I moved to the United States in 1986.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:05):**  Started working in summer camps and conference centers.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:10):**  And in 1998, as part of my work of running a conference center, I ran across an organization  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:16):**  called the Natural Builders and they decided to do a conference called the Colloquium at  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:23):**  my facilities and realized what an incredible group of people this was in terms of creativity  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:30):**  and care for the earth and community.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:36):**  And they came back a couple of years in a row after that and I eventually decided to  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:39):**  join them and became a teacher of natural building.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:43):**  I took a few workshops and co-taught a few workshops and that's how I got involved.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:50):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:51):**  Let's get started actually from the beginning because you have an interesting definition  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:54):**  of what natural building is.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:03:56):**  So could you explain the difference between natural building and green building?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:01):**  Because that's another common misconception.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:04):**  That's an interesting question.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:06):**  I think the idea of natural building is that we, I think the way most people understand  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:14):**  natural building is that we try to use mostly materials that are near the building site  
**[0:04:21-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:21):**  and that are harvested or mined by the builder themselves.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:30):**  Which of course is very different from green building which uses mostly manufactured materials  
**[0:04:36-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:36):**  but that may be less toxic or maybe mined or manufactured more in a less damaging way  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:44):**  but that's significantly different.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:46):**  So green building is often still putting different manufactured components together versus natural  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:54):**  building would be where you harvest your own materials and build with those.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:04:59):**  And then in addition to that natural building has other components with that that would  
**[0:05:06-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:06):**  include a strong emphasis on owner builder and then simplicity and emphasis on responsible  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:16):**  buildings such as smaller tottishes rather than big boxes and so forth.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:22):**  Yeah I like that.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:23):**  I think that's important to make that distinction.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:26):**  I get asked that all the time too if I'm a green builder or natural builder and really  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:31):**  the emphasis on manufactured materials or industrial materials however sustainably produced  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:38):**  they may be is still quite a significant difference from working with mostly minimally processed  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:45):**  local materials like you pointed out for natural building.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:49):**  And of course those materials can be very different depending on the site where you  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:53):**  happen to be building.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:54):**  You know it could be earth it could be wood depending on what you have there and what  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:05:59):**  you have access to.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:01):**  But yeah those different emphasis are I know very important to me as well.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:06):**  Yeah and of course there is nothing against doing a hybrid form of many different forms  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:15):**  of building.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:16):**  You can do a part of your house in conventional building and part of your house with green  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:21):**  building materials and part of your house in mud.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:27):**  So I think it's a mistake to think that your house has to be purer one way or the other.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:35):**  Yeah I very much agree with that too for sure.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:38):**  Now one of the main reasons why I reached out to you to be on this podcast in the beginning  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:42):**  is because of an article you wrote on the house alive Web site called Cobb speed.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:47):**  Could you summarize that article for us real quick and break down the calculations and  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:51):**  considerations that would put conventional and natural buildings to a much more fair  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:57):**  comparison.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:06:58):**  Well it's a complicated question.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:04):**  We get a lot of it in earthen construction or in Cobb building.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:08):**  We get a lot of questions but one of the most common questions is is this too long?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:16):**  And the reason why it's a complicated question is because you're not comparing apples to  
**[0:07:20-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:20):**  apples and with that I mean in conventional construction building materials are provided  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:29):**  that are already pre-manufactured.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:31):**  Like for example you don't get a tree but you get a 2x4 or 2x6 and you don't get a bag  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:38):**  of gypsum but you get a sheet of drywall.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:42):**  In natural building often we harvest the materials ourselves or process them and then build with  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:50):**  them which needless to say takes more time but that comes with you know significant savings  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:07:58):**  in money and perhaps you can do it ecologically more responsible and there's some real advantages  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:06):**  to that.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:08):**  So in other words if you were to compare the two building techniques let's say Cobb building  
**[0:08:13-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:13):**  and conventional construction you could start out making an affair comparison to either  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:21):**  have the conventional builder process the trees themselves and the gypsum and make their  
**[0:08:27-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:27):**  own paint and weave their own carpet or perhaps you can supply the Cobb builders with a ready  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:35):**  mix Cobb mix that you only have to add water and put in the machine and the Cobb will just  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:39):**  come out like a big muddy worm and you can't just build the house that way.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:46):**  So either way that would make a fair comparison.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:51):**  And then the other thing I think that's a main gist of the article is that and that's  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:08:58):**  kind of along the same lines is that in conventional construction there's a lot of power tools  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:04):**  and a lot of things added to the construction site that make the building go faster and  
**[0:09:09-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:09):**  you could do that with Cobb as well you can add tractors and lifts and mixing machines  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:16):**  and so forth and essentially make the building process as just as fast as a conventional  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:23):**  building but then you're also more likely to end up with a building that's similar to  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:28):**  a conventional building that's not built with as much love and care and creativity and idiosyncrasy  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:34):**  and so and there's nothing wrong with that choice I think it's fine to build an earthen  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:39):**  building with a lot of machines and it will certainly go a lot faster and more or less  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:46):**  as fast as a conventional building but you get a different building site and you get  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:51):**  a different house as a result of that.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:09:55):**  Certainly and I know you mentioned too in the article looking over the span of the life  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:02):**  cycle of the building in the long term the comparisons also even out a lot that way as  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:08):**  well.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:09):**  Sure that's the other way you can look at it is if you build a quality and it's probably  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:13):**  true of conventional building too if you build a quality home that's built slowly and with  
**[0:10:18-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:18):**  care for foundation and roofing details and that has a lot of beauty artistic value into  
**[0:10:27-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:27):**  it then the house per definition is more likely to last longer and so if you take a house  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:35):**  that was built over let's say if a six month period will last 50 years or a house that  
**[0:10:42-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:42):**  was built over a two year period that last 500 years then obviously the the the lair  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:51):**  house was built a lot more efficiently in terms of years of house you get for your building  
**[0:10:57-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:10:57):**  time but I think the way a conventional housing system is set up with building materials and  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:07):**  mortgages and contractors is that the reward goes out to the people that build houses for  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:14):**  a short in a the shortest amount of time and and but the calculation is not taken to the  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:21):**  next level but you'll also see how long those houses last or how happy the people are in  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:27):**  those houses.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:28):**  Yeah absolutely.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:29):**  Let alone the damage the damage they may cause to the people themselves or the environment  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:37):**  later on.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:38):**  Yeah I love that you brought attention to these comparisons because they can be otherwise  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:42):**  very hard to illustrate and frankly I would recommend that anyone considering either building  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:48):**  or contracting a natural structure take a look at all of these factors before getting  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:55):**  into what potentially is one of the biggest investments they may ever make in their lives  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:11:59):**  at least monetarily or possibly even over the span of them actively contributing to  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:05):**  the build site depending on how they choose to manage it and just being that extra bit  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:09):**  informed can certainly help people to justify the initial costs for value that they're getting  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:15):**  and just in general be better prepared for what they're getting into with such a large  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:19):**  investment.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:20):**  Yeah and you know I think the other interesting question is which I think more and more people  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:25):**  asking these days what is the value of speed in and of itself.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:30):**  Now let's say for example if you live in a if you just got hit by an earthquake or a  
**[0:12:34-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:34):**  flood and you have no place to live then speed might be very attractive.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:42):**  If you're broke and you're building a house and you have to go back to work but I really  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:48):**  position themselves well before building a house so they can actually take time and build  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:55):**  slowly.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:12:57):**  So I think it's interesting question about co-buildings being slow.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:04):**  And really I think the more important question to ask ourselves is what is the value of building  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:11):**  fast?  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:12):**  Like what do we actually gain from it?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:15):**  And again I think the whole housing system and construction world is set up to make money  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:21):**  and to go fast but if you want a wholesome natural house you might want to consider setting  
**[0:13:27-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:27):**  yourself up to make it a very slow building process and actually enjoy the process as  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:35):**  you go along.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:38):**  And I think once you're actually enjoying it then it doesn't matter that much whether  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:42):**  take one or two or three years to build your house.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:45):**  And to some degree there's people who continue on working on their house and adding on and  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:49):**  beautifying it and continuing that relation with the house that's alive and keeps changing.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:13:57):**  And I think that's the better attitude but it does require that you step out of the world  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:03):**  and build your own house and build your own house and build your own house and build your  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:10):**  own house and build your own house.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:13):**  And I think that's the best way to do it.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:18):**  Certainly.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:19):**  How does design come into the equation with natural building?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:22):**  I myself teach in my courses that a natural building can be just as consumptive and wasteful  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:27):**  in operating costs as an industrial home if it's designed poorly.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:32):**  So what in your opinion are the most important considerations when designing a home to be  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:37):**  both comfortable and efficient?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:40):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:41):**  I'm speaking mostly for people that live in the northern hemisphere.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:45):**  I think the relation to the sun and the mountains is probably in the wind is the most important  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:51):**  choice you make for your house.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:14:55):**  So that your house doesn't overheat in the summertime and takes maximum advantage of  
**[0:15:01-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:01):**  your of the available sunlight to have your house heat up naturally.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:12):**  Other than that I think the wall systems are actually relatively unimportant as far as  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:19):**  I'm concerned.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:20):**  Unless you live in extreme climates like Alaska or whatever Minnesota you're really really  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:26):**  cold climates.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:29):**  Other than that I think the R value of your walls is relatively unimportant.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:34):**  I think it's really important in terms of efficiency and design that you have really  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:39):**  good windows and doors and that the insulation in your ceiling is really good.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:43):**  That's ultimately where the heat, those are the areas where most of the heat disappears.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:50):**  And I think in terms of the layout of the house I'm a big advocate of keeping the, well  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:15:57):**  sort of the steps, is that you design your house not just as an indoor space but also  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:02):**  as an outdoor space.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:06):**  And so you keep the indoor space relatively small with whatever you need, a place to cook,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:11):**  a place to sleep, a place to hang out, a place to go to the bathroom.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:18):**  And then you mimic all those needs that you have and build provisions for those on the  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:28):**  outside too.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:29):**  So you have an outdoor place to sleep and an outdoor place to cook and an outdoor place  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:32):**  to sit around a fire.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:37):**  And that you essentially for as long as it's possible and depending on your climate and  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:43):**  your circumstances, but that you'll live outside as much as you live inside.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:50):**  And I think that really enables you to keep your house smaller and when you do need heat  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:16:55):**  in your house to minimize it or heat or light or whatever, a lot of provisions.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:01):**  And I think that's a different philosophy in the sense that most people design their  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:08):**  house, their interior space and have everything they need.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:11):**  And then once they're done with that, then the outdoor space has become a little bit  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:15):**  of an after.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:17):**  And I think we're not doing ourselves a favor with that.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:20):**  I think we should be outside as much as we can and it's good for our health and brings  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:26):**  us in touch with nature and it makes the indoor feel better too once we are indoors.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:31):**  Yeah, I definitely agree with that.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:33):**  I think obviously it depends a whole lot on the climate and where you're living, just  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:38):**  how much outdoor time per year is going to be comfortable for you.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:42):**  But very similar to what you mentioned, I teach gradient design in which you put as  
**[0:17:48-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:48):**  few necessary functions entirely encapsulated within a structure and basically try and move  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:17:56):**  as many functions as possible into outdoor or seasonally appropriate space.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:02):**  And there is a kind of a gradient effect between what feels completely indoors and what is  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:09):**  completely outdoors achieved through, you know, roofed in areas that perhaps only have  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:15):**  one or two walls all the way over to like pergolas where sunlight and rain can still  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:21):**  get through, but it is somewhat covered and sheltered all the way to your outdoor space.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:26):**  And this way, not only do you save money in how much you need to construct and the materials  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:31):**  required to give you all of those functions, but you start to perform more of them outdoors.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:38):**  And that has a lot of benefits for your health and for your lifestyle as well.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:43):**  Yeah, and I think, I mean, it's true that some climates are not very conducive to being  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:48):**  outdoors in the winter and sometimes in the heat of the summer.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:18:54):**  But I think we should step away from the idea that one shell or one box or one house can  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:01):**  do everything all the time.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:03):**  It's I think it's healthier to think of a house as something that provides you shelter  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:07):**  from the cold or heat.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:10):**  But then if the weather is pleasant outside, you have all kinds of things set up where  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:17):**  you can spend time outside so you don't have to be in your house.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:22):**  And I think we've been able to live the way many Westerners have lived in recent days  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:32):**  because of it.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:34):**  And of course they are eating.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:40):**  But I don't think they're that healthy for us and I don't think they're that pleasant.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:44):**  I think it's a good idea to move to the outside.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:47):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:48):**  For sure.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:50):**  Another element to a well-performing house that often doesn't get covered in many natural  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:19:54):**  building workshops is the integration of appropriate technology for the utility systems and waste  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:00):**  disposal especially.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:02):**  Tell us a little about what appropriate technology covers and why it's essential to a well-functioning  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:08):**  natural structure.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:09):**  Well, there's different views on what appropriate technology is, but for me it's something that  
**[0:20:14-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:14):**  is inexpensive, that's easy to make yourself with parts from the hardware store or parts  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:22):**  in the woods or rocks or whatever you find around you.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:26):**  It's easy to repair and it's very careful with the use of resources.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:33):**  And so a good example of appropriate technology would bucket the toilet by many known as the  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:39):**  U-maneuver system, which would be different from a $10,000 composting toilet system with  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:46):**  fans and bells and whistles and high expense and things that can break and takes up a lot  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:52):**  of space.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:53):**  So that would be somewhat less appropriate than an awkward toilet.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:20:58):**  Another good example would be rainwater gathering, a metal roof that funnels water into a rainwater  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:05):**  tank that you use to irrigate your garden or take showers or do the dishes.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:12):**  Simple solar ovens, lamps, anything that replaces complicated energy appliances or machines  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:26):**  that take a lot of energy that are very inefficient and that keep things localized.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:32):**  So you use the sun and the rain that is right around your house to make things happen around  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:36):**  your house to create you, to give yourself some comfort and sanitation.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:42):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:43):**  I'm lately really interested in microelectronics.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:50):**  This kind of a...  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:51):**  You mean like home scale power generation?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:53):**  Next step, yeah.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:21:55):**  In the sense that I've lived off the grid for 20 years now and I have solar panels and  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:01):**  less batteries and lights and a blender and a computer and radio.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:06):**  And lately with the onset of tiny LED lights and power packs and miniature solar panels,  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:14):**  I'm now able to charge my phone and have lights in my house just with something that costs  
**[0:22:20-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:20):**  only $100 and is completely foolproof and takes no installation costs, no permits.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:28):**  It's just a few little wires in a little cabin and it's become simpler and easier.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:33):**  And even though I don't really understand power packs and solar panels, the over the  
**[0:22:38-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:38):**  shelf products are so inexpensive and foolproof now that I started to teach those systems  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:46):**  at my workshops now too.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:48):**  And there seem to be an increased interest in that, in scaling back our electricity use  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:22:53):**  and keeping it super simple, just do a few LED lights and charging a phone or a computer.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:00):**  Yeah, well certainly the technology has come a long way and made it a lot more accessible  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:04):**  for more people to not only afford the systems but even have them simple enough that they  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:09):**  could hook them up themselves without having to hire a technician.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:13):**  I think that's going to open a lot of doors for people to get their own consumption more  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:18):**  independent and decentralized in years to come.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:21):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:22):**  And it's interesting because natural builders or people like mud hut builders like myself  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:30):**  are often looked upon as the ludites or people who don't like technology or anything like  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:36):**  that.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:37):**  And I believe the contrary, I think there's a lot of very interesting technology in electronics  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:44):**  that can greatly ensure illustration in your mud hut and makes it so you can be independent  
**[0:23:51-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:23:51):**  of the grid and have systems and phones and lots of computers in a very simple and very  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:03):**  efficient way.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:05):**  Another question that I hear often is how long will earthen homes last, specifically  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:10):**  earthen homes.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:11):**  Now how do you answer that loaded question because obviously there's so much more information  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:16):**  that you need to gather to be able to give an estimate.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:19):**  Yeah, I answer it by saying that mud homes have two beautiful qualities or there are  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:29):**  many beautiful qualities but in relation to how long they last, they can last very, very  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:35):**  long up to a thousand years or longer for as long as the roof stays on and the foundation  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:42):**  was done well.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:44):**  Or they can last a very short time and…  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:46):**  Because the way that earthen is essentially by the time you take the windows and doors  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:51):**  off and you take the roof off, it can become a pile of mud again.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:24:56):**  And so I think it's totally legitimate to build earthen homes that your great, great,  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:02):**  great, great, great, et cetera, grandchildren can still enjoy.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:09):**  I also think it's totally legitimate to build an earthen home that needs to be rebuilt in  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:15):**  fifteen years because it doesn't create a big pile of toxic waste and the materials  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:21):**  are relatively inexpensive.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:24):**  When I was, I built a house in Kenya and there until recently it was very common for us to  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:31):**  last fifteen years and then they would rebuild them because some of the wood that they used  
**[0:25:37-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:37):**  would be by term mud and some wooden poles and a grass roof and people have time and  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:51):**  know the materials and it wasn't a big deal to rebuild it.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:56):**  It was part of life to every now and then rebuild your house.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:25:58):**  I think that's a fine strategy too.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:01):**  It doesn't fit well with our Western lifestyles, but it's definitely a good earthen building  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:09):**  task.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:10):**  But again, going back, I think parts of the Great Wall of China and the pyramids were  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:20):**  built thousands of years ago and are still standing.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:23):**  And mosques that were built in medieval times in the Middle East are still standing and  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:33):**  the cottages in England.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:37):**  And the most obvious is the Pueblo in Taos, New Mexico.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:41):**  That's a thousand years old.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:43):**  It's the oldest continuous inhabited building in the United States.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:50):**  So that whole village has lasted for a thousand years living in earthen buildings.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:26:57):**  Those are quite testaments to what is possible with this.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:01):**  I think it's interesting too.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:07):**  It's paradoxical because the more we use materials that have the quality of lasting forever like  
**[0:27:15-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:15):**  concrete and glass and stainless steel and marble and really refined plastics, these  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:24):**  materials we bring them on because they give us a feeling that they will last forever.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:28):**  They don't wear, they don't take any maintenance.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:31):**  But then when we build with them, we actually start to struggle because they don't actually  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:40):**  change.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:41):**  They don't have a life in them.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:42):**  They don't seem to take scratch as well or things.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:45):**  They instantly become ugly and start to turn against us.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:51):**  And so I see a lot of buildings that actually would have the potential of the last years  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:27:56):**  being taken down after 20 or 30 or 40 years because the rooftops are out of fashion or  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:03):**  the stainless steel is starting to become too ugly or the concrete doesn't wear nicely.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:10):**  I think in design and in choosing materials, the paradox more materials that will last  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:21):**  forever, the more we want to actually take down those buildings and start over again  
**[0:28:26-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:26):**  because we find that we've surrounded ourselves by dead materials and eventually that is not  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:34):**  good for our soul.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:37):**  Now in your experience working with students and giving workshops all around the world,  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:41):**  do you think it's realistic for someone to have the skills and knowledge necessary to  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:45):**  build their own house after taking just one course?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:48):**  Yes and no.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:50):**  It depends a lot on the person.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:54):**  Obviously there's no guarantee that somebody can build a house after one, let's say a 10-day  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:58):**  workshop.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:28:59):**  But there are certainly a lot of people who have done that and so it is possible.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:07):**  I haven't quite figured out what the determining factor is.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:11):**  An obvious one is, but I'm not even counting these people, but there's people who take  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:14):**  my workshops who have previous building experience, they've already banged the cabin together  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:19):**  or built a house or have worked in the construction industry.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:24):**  And for them it's much easier to go on and start replacing materials, let's say drywall  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:31):**  with mud.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:35):**  But then there's also novice builders who would take a workshop and never done anything  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:42):**  and they go off and they start building a house.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:45):**  The most interesting experience I've had with a guy who took a one-day sort of a scratch  
**[0:29:50-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:50):**  and sniff workshop of mine three years ago, it was in May, and he started shortly after  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:29:59):**  there in his backyard.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:02):**  And he now has, say two years later, he has a tourist girlfriend that he built entirely  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:10):**  by himself working a day and a half a week on his day off.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:16):**  And with no building experience, no nothing, and he just sort of, he read my book and he  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:22):**  read a couple of other books and went for it.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:26):**  So why does it work for him and not for others?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:30):**  I don't know.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:31):**  Some of it has to do with confidence and strength and problem solving skills.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:37):**  But I'd be the first to admit that you can become a master builder in 10 days, but with  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:45):**  a lot of courage and determination, you can do it.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:49):**  Certainly.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:51):**  It's often one of those things where you can advance as much as you apply yourself during  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:30:57):**  the time when you're learning and how much responsibility you take for yourself to fill  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:02):**  in any gaps in your knowledge that you didn't get from that course.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:05):**  I agree.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:07):**  And I should also say, I don't really, my priority is not to teach people per se, I  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:13):**  don't have the narrow goal of teaching people how to build a house.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:17):**  I also teach people how to build earth and ovens and how to do earth and plasters and  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:20):**  floors, how to do light, straw, clay, infill methods.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:26):**  And basically give people the skills that wherever, whatever stage they're in, whether  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:32):**  they have a tiny backyard and they want to build a little garden wall or they want to  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:39):**  put some earth and plaster on their drywall or they want to insulate a house or their  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:44):**  ceiling better, or perhaps take the next step and build a little cottage or build a whole  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:51):**  house for a family.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:31:53):**  All those things are possible and we shouldn't limit earth and construction to just housebuilding.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:02):**  I think there are so many hybrid forms and ways of making earth and construction or making  
**[0:32:09-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:09):**  mud building part of your life all the way down to putting face pains on your body.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:17):**  For sure.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:18):**  One of the most common hurdles and sticking points that I hear from people looking to  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:22):**  build naturally in the US or in other heavily regulated countries is that the codes and  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:27):**  permits don't allow for cob or other natural buildings to be constructed.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:32):**  How have you had success with regulatory bodies or gotten around the permitting process throughout  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:36):**  your career?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:38):**  Well, there's a couple of, I've applied a couple of different strategies.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:46):**  One is I built a code approved hybrid house for my family and that was basically a two  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:32:56):**  by four stick frame house with a straw bale infill and then a cob and earthen interior.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:03):**  So I used three different techniques like earthen building, straw bale infill and conventional  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:09):**  construction and that went through the building code with flying colors.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:15):**  There was just no problem and I live in an area with pretty strict building codes.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:23):**  So that's an easy way to go about it and sort of my advice is to not be a purist if you  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:29):**  want to build a large house that's code approved.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:35):**  Another successful strategy that many people have done is just to move to areas if you're  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:39):**  a foot loose and fancy, you move to areas where there are no building codes, which there  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:46):**  are many in the United States.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:50):**  Several states, definitely in rural areas, there's now code enforcement.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:33:56):**  I think Idaho, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Missouri, Tennessee, those are all states that I've  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:05):**  heard people building without building codes without any problems.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:11):**  And then another option is to build small, in most cases under 200 square feet, which  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:21):**  is when you can put a non-inhabitable structure, like an auxiliary structure up on a piece  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:26):**  of land and you're not allowed to live in it.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:31):**  But again with the little LED lights and a composting toilet or a bucket toilet and a  
**[0:34:38-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:38):**  few other simple things, you can not make it look like it's lived in and then it will  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:46):**  be hard for building officials to bust you or to tell you to take it out.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:52):**  So those are I think three of the most common strategies.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:34:58):**  Yeah and I've heard from quite a few other natural builders throughout interviews in  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:01):**  this podcast that for the most part if you go into a building situation with a cooperative  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:07):**  attitude and a willingness to work with the authorities in order to get your structure  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:13):**  legalized, chances are they're going to be pretty helpful and work with you as well.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:19):**  But if you go into it with an antagonistic mindset or kind of sort of a pessimistic relationship  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:25):**  with the coding or permitting authorities, you're much more likely to have problems with  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:30):**  them as you move forward.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:32):**  You know I hear that a lot too and I'm not sure if I heard evidence to that.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:37):**  I think it's a good attitude.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:40):**  My experience with code officials is they're mostly bureaucrats and they have rules to  
**[0:35:47-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:47):**  follow and so I think what is more at least in my experience is that people don't realize  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:35:57):**  there are provisions in the code that you can do.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:01):**  Like for example there's nothing like people are worried about putting in an earthen floor  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:06):**  for example or doing earthen plasters and there's nothing in the code anywhere in any  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:12):**  place that prevents you from doing that.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:16):**  And so I really encourage people to not be afraid to ask but generally speaking if the  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:27):**  county does not allow let's say structural cobwalls then no matter how friendly you are  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:34):**  they're usually not going to bend the rules for you if you come with a big smile on your  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:40):**  face because they have to somehow justify it.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:46):**  But I do think there's a lot of ways if you read the code carefully that you can find  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:51):**  ways to do things that you didn't think were possible.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:54):**  Yeah absolutely.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:36:55):**  So before I let you go here and you've been very generous with your time Conrad could  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:00):**  you tell us how people can get in touch with you your company House Alive and if you have  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:05):**  any events coming up like workshops or work parties.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:10):**  So I have a website called House Alive dot o r g and people can visit me there.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:17):**  I also have a Facebook page and an Instagram account.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:25):**  I have two workshops coming up in July and August.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:31):**  Actually the workshop in July is full but I have still some spaces left in August and  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:38):**  they're kind of there's something new that I'm trying to do is I'm introducing a new  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:43):**  term called Versa Terra.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:45):**  It's made up two words Versa and Terra.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:51):**  And I'm trying to create a workshop that really encompasses all the different ways of earth  
**[0:37:58-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:37:58):**  constructions and make people feel comfortable with that and become really familiar about  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:05):**  how clay soils can create building materials.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:09):**  And that's the essence of these are 10 day workshops.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:14):**  That's the essence of these workshops.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:17):**  And the idea is really that once people have taken that workshop they can go on all different  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:21):**  directions with that whether they want to build an oven or remodel their house or built  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:26):**  a cottage or an earthen hut somewhere.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:31):**  You can go in any direction.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:34):**  And so you can find more about that on my website and the description of that.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:38):**  Excellent.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:39):**  Yeah those sound fantastic.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:40):**  Thank you.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-conrad-rogue/#t=0:38:41):**  No thank you Conrad.

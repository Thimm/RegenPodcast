**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:34):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:46):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:14):**  Before we get started with this month's Regenerative Roundtable, I'd like to share a unique opportunity  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:18):**  with all of you who are looking to grow their knowledge and impact on the regeneration of  
**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:23):**  our planet and ecology.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:25):**  Between June 21st and the 24th, I'll be sharing a free webinar through the Sustainable Living  
**[0:01:30-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:30):**  Guide Summit.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:32):**  Look for my lesson titled Natural and Ecological Building, Reclaiming Your Living Environment  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:37):**  with Natural Materials and Regenerative Design, and it's absolutely free!  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:41):**  I'll be covering why the construction industry is the world's leading polluter, why modern  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:46):**  buildings cause so many health, environmental, and community problems, why permaculture design  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:52):**  courses miss the most important aspect of any living site, how you can take back control  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:01:57):**  of your home and built environment, how you can find lifelong freedom by building naturally,  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:02:03):**  and even an overview on some of the many ways to build superior structures with natural  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:02:07):**  and recycled materials.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:02:09):**  This short introduction course will be the first in a series of resources and short classes

**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:02:54):**  All right, here we are again with another regenerative roundtable.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:02:57):**  I'm here with the usual suspects.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:02:58):**  I've got Neil Haggerty.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:02:59):**  How are you doing, buddy?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:00):**  Doing great, Oliver.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:03):**  And a regular on the show, a good contributor and friend of ours, Shad Goodsy from Atitlán  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:07):**  Organics.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:08):**  How you doing, man?  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:09):**  I'm doing great, Oliver.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:10):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:11):**  Hey, always a pleasure.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:12):**  All right, let's start out how we usually do and talk about what we've been up to in  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:15):**  this last month because I know we've been working on lots of projects.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:18):**  You guys taught a course.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:19):**  Neil, why don't you start us off and tell us about the intro course that you guys just  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:23):**  finished up with?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:24):**  Yeah, we just did really a variation of the intro course that me and Shad started with  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:31):**  Atitlán Organics, but that I've been co-facilitating on for two years.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:36):**  We made a pretty significant change to the course.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:38):**  We decided to bring all the focus, all the practical learning for the course on the parcel  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:45):**  of our worker.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:48):**  That's our worker, Nicolás, who's been with us for the last six months.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:51):**  We went up to his parcel and instead of isolating all the components of the practicals like  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:03:57):**  plant propagation, soil building, contour working, we consolidated them all on his little  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:04):**  parcel and we left him at the end of the week with a really nice food forest.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:10):**  So that took up honestly like a lot of my time over the last month between planning  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:15):**  it out, getting the plants, and then finally executing it during the course.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:20):**  So really that was definitely the highlight for me this month.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:24):**  Well, one of the things I like about all of the back end work that we did to plan this  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:29):**  is we actually ended up meeting some really cool people and making relationships within  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:32):**  the community.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:33):**  Our guy up in Pajol Mel who does the plant propagation and will probably be doing a lot  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:38):**  more for us in the future.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:40):**  And yeah, just everybody else that we got to work with in order to set this up and collaborate  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:46):**  with the local community in the process.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:47):**  So Shad, tell me about the last month that you've been working on and the projects that  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:52):**  you've had going on yourself.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:55):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:04:57):**  So yeah, also the course just wrapped up on Saturday and yeah, the project, the practical  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:04):**  was absolutely a success and I think we'll dive into that more deeply.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:08):**  But also, you know, in October of last year, we finally got to a point where we were able  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:14):**  to offer three to five full scholarships for Guatemalan students to come and take the intro  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:21):**  to permaculture course and just like also be at the bamboo and eat the food and just  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:25):**  like meet a lot of people from all over the world.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:28):**  And this one was just like super great.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:30):**  I think we had 16 people, we had seven Guatemalans, someone from Japan, people from Europe, from  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:36):**  North America, just really a super diverse group.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:39):**  So that's like always exciting.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:43):**  Other than that, the rain's been like hammering us like nonstop.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:48):**  It's been a really wet May and June and we didn't get our greenhouses up yet and we decided  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:05:55):**  to just like throw the plastic up with a couple of bamboos and like some twine and it's holding  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:01):**  up really well.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:03):**  But I don't think those greenhouses can come fast enough.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:06):**  Yeah, it's been really similar for us when these really heavy rains came.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:12):**  You quickly see where all the leaks are in your buildings and every part that starts  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:17):**  to hold water where you didn't want it to.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:19):**  We had to do some real drainage kind of additions to the goat house because it was starting  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:25):**  to get wet inside of there.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:26):**  Tell us about some of the things we had to renovate, Neil.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:29):**  Yeah, that was a funny one.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:32):**  I mean, I guess it was actually a pretty basic error that we made.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:35):**  We terraced out the goat house on a downslope and we put in a little drain above the house,  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:42):**  but it just wasn't enough so water was coming down and it was seeping in.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:47):**  So we ended up having to carry in a bunch of pebbles and sand to bring the level up  
**[0:06:52-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:06:52):**  in the goat house and then also dug down, made sort of like a French drain, also put  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:01):**  in drainage, also put in canals on the roof and then terraced up above the goat house  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:07):**  as well.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:08):**  So those actions combined now mean that it's like nice and dry and cozy in there, which  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:14):**  is nice because we also just have like five new baby goats chilling in there.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:18):**  So it's really nice to see them on like a nice dry, strawy kind of floor, you know.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:25):**  That's been one of the really fun things.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:28):**  The baby goats are two weeks old now.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:30):**  We've got five, four girls and one macho and they're just old enough now that they've really  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:37):**  got energy and they're bouncing around and jumping on everything and pretty soon we'll  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:41):**  start weaning them off of the milk and they're going to just join the rest of the herd when  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:45):**  they go out for the caminatas to go and forage and that's most of their food each day, right?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:51):**  Yeah, I mean look, there's a whole, we should probably do a whole other episode on managing  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:55):**  goats but yeah, it's nice.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:07:58):**  We let them, Shad, I was lucky that we got our goats from Shad and at the Atlanta Organics  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:03):**  and he had a nice system down that he taught to me where we let the goats drink all the  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:09):**  milk they want for the first two weeks and then start to slowly wean them over another  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:13):**  two month process.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:16):**  So that's really important.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:17):**  It works well for like the health of the goats and also for milk production.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:22):**  So yeah, that's fun.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:24):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:26):**  I think any like kind of dramatic changes in animals and their diets have to happen  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:34):**  gradually and as Neil mentioned, the weaning process may start at two weeks old but it  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:40):**  won't finish for three months and there's a process to go through that so that they're  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:44):**  healthy.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:45):**  Yeah, I mean managing any of these living systems really in a regenerative way has to  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:51):**  be focused around the health of the main participants, whether it's animals, plants, starting always  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:08:58):**  with the soil and you know, the initial inputs.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:01):**  On another note, the house that we're building is moving along really fast now.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:06):**  We finally put in the rest of the straps, we call them sintas, which are offcuts of  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:10):**  bamboo in order to wrap up the walls and we've been filling them all up with our earthen  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:16):**  mix for the Bahareke configuration.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:20):**  We finished the entire first floor, we put up all of the support joists for the second  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:24):**  floor and this week hopefully they'll finish up filling up the walls with mud and we'll  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:30):**  start doing some finish work and even moving into the house because both me and Neil have  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:34):**  been camping underneath our unfinished house while the work continues on and it's been  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:39):**  quite a process, especially with this amount of rain.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:41):**  Yeah, it's pretty intense.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:43):**  Hey, it's one of the sacrifices you're going to make.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:46):**  There's a pond there, I'm not sure if you got it.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:48):**  This is why we keep them around.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:09:55):**  So yes, the last month has been really involved, a lot of cool projects getting started, but  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:01):**  one in particular that I really want to focus on on this episode is what we're tentatively  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:06):**  calling the service project.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:07):**  Now Shad, you really took the lead over this kind of slowly developing it over the last  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:11):**  eight years finding a way to really put some of our expertise and knowledge to work for  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:16):**  the local community and part of that prototype was worked out on the last intro to permaculture  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:23):**  course like you guys talked about, but could you go in depth a little bit about how we're  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:27):**  going to scale this up and what is the main aim of this project?  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:31):**  Yeah, thanks Oliver.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:36):**  I know we have a bit of time still, maybe I'll take a few minutes and give a little  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:43):**  background.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:44):**  So while bootstrapping the farm, I guess now five years ago, I had a job in NGO, a non-government  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:52):**  organization that works in Guatemala and during my two years there, I was the agricultural  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:10:59):**  specialist made for community gardens about 50 or 60 gray water banana circle gardens  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:05):**  to stop the dirty water from going into the lake.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:08):**  Even though I believed in the work I was doing at the ground level, I had a lot of challenges  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:13):**  about NGOs and just the whole approach to international development and outside development.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:20):**  And I actually just felt really challenged by it and over like those two years I got  
**[0:11:24-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:24):**  quite cynical and quit, you know, and really kind of denounced the whole nonprofit world.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:35):**  I won't go into all the like reasons why I think I had that position then, but a lot  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:40):**  of it just felt like these solutions that are presented are often times out of context  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:47):**  that they're not like appropriate to that particular community, that particular valley,  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:54):**  like something that would work here in sooner now may not work in high belito.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:11:57):**  And I think a lot of the NGO approach is like a one size fits all.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:00):**  So anyway, then the next several years, really I deal on organics focused on the profitability  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:04):**  of the farm and focused on also building up some local producers.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:08):**  So we buy some of our salads from two local growers.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:11):**  We buy a lot of our coffee and a lot of our honey.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:13):**  So kind of focusing on those relationships.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:15):**  But in the back of my mind, I always had this idea like we, I want to give something back  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:20):**  like we're, you know, the valley of soon as it opened their arms to us and we are visitors  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:25):**  here and it's nice if we can be of service to the valley, but also being super careful  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:30):**  to not fall into that NGO trap of just doing something that like we think works, but is  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:36):**  not appropriate to the, to the town.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:40):**  Another aspect of this is I think bridging the cultural gap by having a lot of people  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:45):**  work together on for a common goal is really an important aspect as well.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:50):**  And as I mentioned, the courses, they're always so diverse and the more diverse the group,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:54):**  the better, like everything just really harmonizes.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:12:57):**  So I also wanted a way that we could get international travelers who come to the lake to abundant  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:02):**  edge and to deal on organics to also give something back to the community that it wouldn't  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:06):**  just be something that we do as a team on our end, but that we actually involve people  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:10):**  who come to visit the project or to take a course or to do something else.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:14):**  And so, yeah, we've, we've basically kind of like brainstormed a lot.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:19):**  Neil and I have just really in the past month, I would say just really started seeing all  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:25):**  the pieces.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:26):**  And I think Neil, you, you said it to me, really, it's been right under our noses for  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:30):**  a year or two.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:32):**  We just didn't like see it all.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:34):**  But yeah, we didn't join up the dots.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:37):**  So I can't, that's kind of my little intro.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:38):**  I don't know.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:39):**  Do you want to maybe like mention a little bit about like what the actual, what we kind  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:43):**  of came up with in the end, Neil?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:46):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:47):**  I mean, it's, it's so true what you say that it was right under our noses because always  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:52):**  the challenge for us in the courses is to get good practicals involved that back up  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:58):**  the theory.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:13:59):**  But because we like advance pretty quickly with our own projects like you on the farm,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:04):**  a lot of things like the earthworks and the soil building techniques, and especially you  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:09):**  working with the A-frame and the hose to work on contour, a lot of that work has already  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:14):**  been done on your farm.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:17):**  And, but it is such a kind of a vital component.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:21):**  So then this time around, we decided to, okay, let's go and plant a food forest on a local  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:29):**  person's land.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:30):**  And it was great because we got to teach all those sort of like practical steps.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:36):**  First we had practice working with the A-frames and the hoses, and that got matched up with  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:41):**  the lecture on contouring and soil conservation and water management.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:47):**  So you know, the students got to hear the lectures and then actually go out into the  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:50):**  field and see those contour lanes.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:53):**  And then we started to like pull the rocks out and make walls.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:14:57):**  And then we have like a whole section on fertility.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:00):**  So for that, the students got to go to the composting chicken house, you explained to  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:05):**  them how it worked, they got to harvest compost, and then also all the organic matter that  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:10):**  we like chopped off the land to get it ready, got stored as mulch.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:15):**  And then our plant propagation section, we got to, you gave a good talk Shad on what  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:21):**  grafting is and why it's like an important interesting technique in agroforestry.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:26):**  And we got to go up to the farm and like teach students to use their intuition to propagate  
**[0:15:34-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:34):**  useful support species for our kind of like the jewel in the crown, which was avocados.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:43):**  So as Oliver, as you mentioned, we made a really interesting connection with just a  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:49):**  great nursery owner here who lives up in a nearby village.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:15:55):**  And he's just like a ninja, Shad would say, at grafting, you know.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:00):**  So we got to use, we got to see how he grafts his trees and teach that to the students.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:08):**  And then the final result was this like just small parcel of land that now had all these  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:13):**  earthworks done on it, all these like dry stack walls on contour and little terraces  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:19):**  that was now so much more inviting as a planting space.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:22):**  And then we kind of culminated the week with like making really nice holes, filling them  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:28):**  up with a nice mix of compost and soil, planting our avocados trees and all our support species  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:35):**  around them.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:36):**  So, you know, the feedback from the students was great.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:38):**  I think they felt like they learned a whole lot.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:40):**  And then also, as Shad says, the beauty of it was because we had like these seven Guatemalan  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:46):**  scholarship students from also like diverse areas in Guatemala, most of them from rural  
**[0:16:52-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:16:52):**  areas mixed with, you know, some Guatemalans from the city and some international students,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:00):**  people from Japan, Europe, all of us working together.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:04):**  It was like a really fun activity.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:06):**  You know, we had music on and then also Nicolas and his kids were there working with us as  
**[0:17:11-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:11):**  well.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:12):**  So it was like, really like I found it a very beautiful experience to be part of.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:19):**  I felt like very privileged to be part of it.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:22):**  And there's something about it in the culture as well.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:25):**  Like there's this really interesting word called Cuchabal that the locals use, which  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:30):**  kind of just means like group activity.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:32):**  It often means like everyone gets together and works on a parcel together to like plant  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:38):**  corn or something like that.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:39):**  So it had that like feel of a Cuchabal to it, you know.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:45):**  Thanks, Nio.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:46):**  That's, yeah, it was a great week.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:49):**  I agree.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:50):**  Just really beautiful.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:51):**  Just like finally planting the trees and then leaving them all mulched and it really looking  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:55):**  nice.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:57):**  And I also wanted to just kind of comment as well.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:17:59):**  So Nico and his family, they were the owners of the land.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:02):**  Also they work at Abundant Edge and he had a young, I would say two year old coffee planting  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:10):**  already in the works there.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:11):**  So the field is something like a lot of people in Sununah, they have coffee fields that are  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:18):**  like not stuck to their home.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:20):**  They're like maybe a mile or two kilometers or something away, but they're managed.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:25):**  You know, they're kind of like a managed zone three, right?  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:30):**  And I think that's a lot of what we're going to see.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:33):**  So if you haven't guessed it yet, our idea is to take what we did in this past course  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:38):**  this past week and start to do it for groups regularly, like maybe to set some goals around  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:45):**  how many trees to plant.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:47):**  But this was the first one and basically even without having an intro to permaculture course,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:53):**  just to give this opportunity to different groups who want to come to Guatemala and do  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:18:56):**  something that will be basically working with local family members, local families from  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:01):**  the community, assessing their land with them and seeing what their goals are.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:06):**  But I think what we'll see a lot of is this coffee, coffee is still here.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:10):**  And that we were able to work around the coffee, none of them got killed, that we were able  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:15):**  to do earthworks around that main crop for them makes the coffee grow better, it enhances  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:21):**  on the goals they've already set about.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:23):**  And then on top of that, adding in this layer of avocados and support plants.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:27):**  And I think it really kind of like really coalesced in my mind seeing it this past week  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:33):**  that like, wow, this is probably what it's going to look like a lot.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:36):**  People are growing coffee, the coffee plants are suffering.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:38):**  We're going to improve the water and soil conservation and diversify the field and give  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:43):**  them also an edible crop on top.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:46):**  Well, so that's one of the kind of add ons to this project that I'm really excited about.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:52):**  And we're not just planting any avocado trees on these people's land.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:19:58):**  I mean, avocados are originally from this area and there's an incredible variety of  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:04):**  species and types that either do well in a certain ecosystem, have some variety of fruit  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:11):**  that's really sought after.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:13):**  All of them have some traits that are worth holding on to.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:16):**  But with globalization and the trade of avocados, a lot of those genetics are being lost.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:22):**  Can you tell us a little bit about how we're going to be preserving heritage breeds through  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:28):**  this ecosystem restoration effort?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:31):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:32):**  So you know, like I think we're all three of us are just super excited about this project.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:40):**  I'm glad we're dedicating a lot of this podcast, this roundtable to this idea.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:45):**  I just think it's so textured and it's so awesome.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:48):**  So we've already kind of touched on, you know, the resource conservation, soil and water  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:52):**  conservation and enhancing the coffee plants, the coffee fields of local Sununah community  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:20:59):**  members.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:00):**  But there's this whole other aspect that to me is one of the most exciting aspects of  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:05):**  the whole project is basically, yeah, the preservation of rare avocados that I would  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:11):**  even go as far as to call endangered.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:15):**  A quick little back like info.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:21):**  If you take a delicious avocado and you like cut it open and it's like the most amazing  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:26):**  avocado you've ever eaten, it's creamy, it's rich, it's buttery, it's so nice flavor, just  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:32):**  like ripened so well, no brown spots.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:35):**  This is awesome.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:36):**  I'm going to take the seed of this delicious avocado and I'm going to plant it in the ground.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:40):**  Right?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:41):**  Well, first off, you plant that seed.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:43):**  You have to wait around 10 to 15 years before you get your first yield of avocados from  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:48):**  a tree that you plant from seed.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:51):**  But then what will happen is you wait 12 or 13 years saying you get your first harvest  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:54):**  and you're all excited.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:55):**  And then when you see the avocado and you cut it open, it's nothing like the avocado  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:21:59):**  whose seeds you planted.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:01):**  It's really a lot different.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:03):**  Maybe it's watery and kind of crunchy and not so great.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:06):**  Maybe it doesn't ripen well.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:08):**  Why is that?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:09):**  It's because plants have sex and especially fruit trees.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:14):**  The genetic variance in diversity that's introduced through pollination of the fruit flower.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:21):**  It makes the next generation of fruit different.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:24):**  And so when you eat that delicious avocado, that was really only the mom's blood, the  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:29):**  mom's genes of the of the offspring tree that you plant.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:34):**  And who knows where the pollen from the fathers came from.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:38):**  And so basically all these trees are in a sense unique expressions of a genetic like  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:44):**  phenotype, a phenotypical expression of a unique gene composition.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:50):**  And so here we literally have hundreds of different types of avocados.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:54):**  We have red avocados.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:22:56):**  We have brown ones, gray ones, black ones, green ones, pear shaped ones, long ones, small  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:02):**  ones, big old fat ones, like literally so many different varieties of avocados.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:07):**  The thing is, if one of those avocados is really special and that tree dies, there's  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:13):**  really a good, good chance that that expression will never occur again easily in this valley.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:20):**  Coupled that with the fact that a lot of the avocados are struggling here, that there is  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:24):**  a general decline in their health.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:26):**  Who knows from what climate change, ecological disturbances in the valley and you don't see  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:31):**  so many young trees going up to replace them.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:35):**  What you're seeing is more Haas avocados, which is one variety of avocado that came  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:40):**  from California.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:41):**  So what we're going to basically do is the trees that we plant on the local people's  
**[0:23:45-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:45):**  land are grafted trees whose scion or top part is coming from the selected rare local  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:54):**  sununa avocados.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:23:55):**  And in that sense, if that tree on Nico's Coffee Farm sticks and the mom tree dies somewhere  
**[0:24:03-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:03):**  else, Nico's Coffee Farm now has preserved this variety of avocado that may never exist  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:11):**  anywhere else again in the future.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:12):**  Yeah, and which by the way are also will be chosen to be super productive disease resistant  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:20):**  trees.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:21):**  So the management will be lower because one of the one of the problems with the Haas avocado  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:25):**  is there's so many of them propagated and they're not from here.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:28):**  So they tend to go hand in hand with quite a lot of agrochemicals.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:33):**  Whereas we're going to be picking varieties that don't get sick that are like really,  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:37):**  really from here, you know, so I think that's really important.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:40):**  And then another thing I'm kind of excited about is like, we haven't fully worked out  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:43):**  the ratio but for every 10 grafted varieties we plant, we'll also plant one just from seed  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:50):**  so that that will keep the the genetics updating.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:24:55):**  And hopefully the more trees like that we plant in proximity to these carefully selected  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:01):**  heirloom varieties, grafted varieties, they'll take on like a mixture of those good characteristics  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:07):**  and so produce something that's like an updated version of that, you know, so that's also  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:12):**  super exciting to me.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:15):**  So tell me both a little bit about how we're going to be structuring this program.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:21):**  How can people get involved?  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:23):**  What is their week going to look like?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:26):**  And how can they get in touch with you to find out how to participate?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:32):**  So first, I think our real idea is we're hoping that groups will come that was really kind  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:42):**  of designed for small groups of like six or eight to 20 people.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:47):**  We're imagining a lot of volunteer organizations.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:50):**  We have some friends that work at kind of volunteer student organizations that plan  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:56):**  trips to Central America.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:25:58):**  We really want to get young people, high school students and gap year students and university  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:02):**  students as well as kind of like volunteers and people who come to travel in Central America  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:07):**  with an idea of giving something back.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:11):**  So that's who we're mainly going to like try to attract to come to do this project.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:18):**  The best way to do it is to check out www.attitlanorganics.com backslash service and you'll see all the  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:25):**  information.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:26):**  Maybe Neil can go in a bit more detail, but the week will include a lot of what he already  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:30):**  mentioned took place in our trial run this past week, but it will be a good mix.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:36):**  I'd say about 40% to 50% really hands on practical just doing the work on the land.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:42):**  But then there'll also be a couple of field trips where we'll get to go learn about grafting  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:47):**  with the local nursery ninja.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:49):**  We'll get to go check out a permaculture community nearby that's all Guatemalan run.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:53):**  So it'd be a good mix of doing something really fruitful, but also having the chance to explore  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:26:59):**  the surrounding areas and meet some other people.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:02):**  Yeah because part of the, I think what a lot of these groups, these organizations that  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:08):**  bring groups to Guatemala, there's two points to it.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:13):**  There's really this desire that the groups have to do some work in the community that  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:21):**  we're in that really brings benefits to the community.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:27):**  So to really take part in a meaningful project.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:32):**  So that's the first thing they'll get to take part in something that will produce food,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:38):**  produce livelihoods, sequester carbon, produce habitat for animals and birds, and have all  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:46):**  these lasting effects for 40, 50, 60 years to come.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:27:53):**  And then yeah, also have hopefully a really transformative, unique experience.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:00):**  It's really such an interesting place we live because you still do have all of this indigenous  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:06):**  knowledge from the local people.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:11):**  We do get like diverse groups and we have diverse groups of facilitators as well.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:15):**  We have, you know, Shad and I and some of our facilitators and designers that we've  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:22):**  worked in the past, international people will be on the project, but we also are going to  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:26):**  be working with Jose Armando, who's from this local community in Quichaya, neighbors of  
**[0:28:33-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:33):**  ours who've been practicing permaculture on their ancestral lands for the last 50 years.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:42):**  So we hope that it will be a really enriching experience that leaves the participants with  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:49):**  the sort of information and the platform to just go on and do really good work afterwards,  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:28:57):**  you know, because that's where a lot of these people that come here are at that point in  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:02):**  their lives where they're maybe about to choose a course in college or they're just coming  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:07):**  out of high school and they're looking to get some like practical real world experience  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:13):**  that's going to like open their eyes and really stand to them.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:16):**  So I think, you know, that doesn't go too much into details, but it's more about what  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:22):**  we hope this course can be, you know, a real symbiosis where people get to do something  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:28):**  that's really meaningful in the community, but also have a great learning and enriching  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:33):**  experience.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:34):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:36):**  Now let's switch gears a little bit.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:38):**  I want to go into some of the details of the ecosystem impacts that this project is going  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:43):**  to have.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:44):**  I know, as you mentioned earlier, the primary goal is going to be preserving the genetics  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:50):**  of the heritage avocados that are from this valley.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:55):**  But you know, it would be pretty out of character for us if we were planting those like in a  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:29:59):**  monoculture or just in a dual culture with the coffee.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:03):**  I know we've got a lot of support plants that we've developed in a gilded system in order  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:09):**  to support the maintenance and the health of all of the components of these ecosystems.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:14):**  Which one of you wants to tell me about how we came up with the guild?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:17):**  Yeah, exactly Oliver.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:19):**  Well, one of the reasons that I came to Guatemala was I got very interested in this idea of  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:25):**  kind of forest gardening and was very taken when I read accounts of, you know, indigenous  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:33):**  agriculturalists from this area that were forest gardens and had these kinds of systems  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:38):**  that appeared to be just wild unmanaged systems to the colonizers that came here.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:45):**  And so it actually took people a long time to realize that this was a type of farming.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:52):**  You know, what people were doing here, where they were working with the fact that ecosystems  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:30:57):**  in this part of the world want to be diverse.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:00):**  All ecosystems do, we know this, but I guess for me it's a case of the more naturally diverse  
**[0:31:07-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:07):**  the ecosystem you are in, the more diverse your productive ecosystem needs to be.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:15):**  So like I say, we're the main crop or the main star of this system is these grafted  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:25):**  Creole avocados.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:28):**  But then it's about, you know, the support plants.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:30):**  So trying to bring in plants that fix nitrogen, cover the ground, produce useful biomass,  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:38):**  you know, produce fruits in the short term and the thing can be like pruned back.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:43):**  So, you know, we've looked at like false peanut and comfrey as two of our kind of like ground  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:50):**  level and biomass producing plants.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:31:54):**  Green pea as a nitrogen fixer and a fast growing one that will just like grow up and protect  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:00):**  the avocado.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:02):**  And then bananas and tree tomatoes because from observing Shad's gills on his farm, those  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:09):**  were like two really, really good support plants.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:13):**  The banana needs to, and this is where management comes in.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:16):**  So designing the management of these systems is important because you can't just plant  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:20):**  all those plants and hope that it's going to be alright.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:23):**  You need to get in there and like prune these things back, especially with the bananas that  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:27):**  tend to clump the fruit once and spit out a bunch of baby plants.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:31):**  So those need to be like cut back and mulch.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:34):**  So that's why including a maintenance program in the design is important.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:42):**  And yeah, the whole thing, the whole goal is that you produce a productive, healthy  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:46):**  ecosystem that doesn't just produce food, but like I said, does all those other things,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:51):**  builds the soil, improves the yield of the coffee plants that are planted around it,  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:32:58):**  provides habitat, you know, forage for animals can also be another great addition to that  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:04):**  gilded system.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:05):**  All right.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:06):**  So yeah, I think I'm going to challenge this a little bit and I think this can make for  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:11):**  a really good discussion.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:14):**  So yeah, let's discourse this.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:20):**  Because I want to know, I like, I never thought of this before.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:22):**  I never heard this, something you said Neil, but like that, that the diversity of your  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:27):**  agricultural ecosystem should kind of like match or like mimic the amount of diversity  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:33):**  in the natural ecosystem of where you're developing at.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:36):**  So if you're in a less diverse ecosystem, it's maybe not as important to have more diversity  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:42):**  than what's already there.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:44):**  Grass and blackberries is probably fine.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:46):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:47):**  So that's an interesting point and I never thought about that.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:50):**  And naturally, if you're in a place like these highlands of Guatemala, there's quite a bit  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:54):**  of diversity.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:33:55):**  And it sounds like you're suggesting that any agriculturally productive ecosystems that  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:00):**  we produce, that we create and design should also have a fairly high, mirror that diversity.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:07):**  Yeah, so that's cool.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:09):**  Aside from that, this is where I go kind of like where I hesitate, I will say.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:17):**  This is zone three.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:19):**  In my mind, I think of this as the local farmer, like Nico's land that we worked with.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:23):**  It's his zone three.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:26):**  The main crop is coffee.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:28):**  When we got there, there was some like older fruit trees that were like, quite old and  
**[0:34:33-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:33):**  kind of far these far spaced out.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:35):**  There was like maybe three whiskey, which is like a vining squash or a chayote, they  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:39):**  call it.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:41):**  And what I keep thinking in my head is there's something really just nice or appealing about  
**[0:34:49-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:49):**  like one line of plants that you chop between is something that you do quickly and you don't  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:34:57):**  have to, it doesn't need a lot of maintenance.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:00):**  And so partly where I feel is I almost feel like by adding in loads of support plants,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:06):**  like all the ones you mentioned, it changes what the management needs are of that system  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:14):**  from if it was just coffee.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:17):**  And I think because I want, like for me, one of my goals is that this is an appropriate  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:21):**  solution that meets the family's goals with their abilities, that it's appropriate to  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:26):**  what they've been doing, what they're used to doing, what they'll probably continue to  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:30):**  do into the future.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:31):**  I think that reducing the amount of change in ongoing management that we ask someone  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:38):**  to take on is going to be important.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:40):**  So I'm not saying we should just do avocados.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:43):**  I think a ring around the comfrey, a ring of comfrey around the avocado, excuse me,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:49):**  and maybe a few tree tomatoes, but even that I would probably like not go for.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:54):**  I would probably just do comfrey and palo de agua for some living barriers.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:35:59):**  And I think I would feel like I could make a case for that being a more, a system with  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:05):**  more longevity.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:07):**  I mean, look, this is why I hugely value your input because as a permaculture farmer in  
**[0:36:13-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:13):**  this region, you have more experience than most people and certainly than I do.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:22):**  And so it is about finding this balance between when you first learn about permaculture and  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:27):**  start practicing it and realize that you can have, there's no limit.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:32):**  The yield of the system is limited only by the imagination and creativity of the designer.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:39):**  But the thing that quote leaves out is and time and energy of that designer.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:45):**  So of course you can have all these tree tomatoes with pole beans running up them and all these  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:52):**  yields on yields on yields, but it getting managed properly is the big thing.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:36:59):**  And ultimately you do realize that your biggest investment after a while in these systems  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:05):**  is labor, be it your own or be it someone else's.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:09):**  So I agree.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:10):**  And for me, this is, it's also the point about design is a circular process.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:16):**  We will be, this design project, this community service project is the culmination of, especially  
**[0:37:26-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:26):**  Shad and my 30 years of experience and study in Guatemala as a bio region.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:36):**  We still haven't fully decided on it.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:38):**  So these kinds of discussions will keep happening as we observe the evolution of the parcels  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:45):**  and talk to the recipients, you know, who go like, you know, it might be, yo, I love  
**[0:37:50-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:50):**  the fact that I've got like, you know, 10 baskets of tree tomatoes a week while my avocados  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:37:59):**  are growing.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:00):**  And then it might also be, you know, mucho monte, I can't let you know.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:05):**  So these will be things that we have to take into account.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:08):**  And also there'll be changes in the design depending on the answers to the questions  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:14):**  of like how much time do you actually have to work here and how far away is your parcel,  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:20):**  you know?  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:21):**  Yeah, I think, I mean, it changes in every context, right?  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:26):**  But really the success of a diverse model is dependent on the size and the amount of  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:30):**  labor that can be put in to that system.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:34):**  So if these are local people with very small amounts of land who just have a monoculture  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:39):**  in them currently and have large family members who are up there, you know, very often, then  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:45):**  you can add a lot more diversity knowing that someone will be around to handle the maintenance  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:50):**  and the harvest.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:52):**  Whereas if they have a large tract of land and there's already somewhat of a polyculture  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:38:56):**  put on there with avocados and coffee, for example, and it's being run by one or two  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:01):**  people, then yeah, the simplicity and the efficiency of the system is absolutely going  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:05):**  to come into play.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:08):**  But that is something that has to be taken into with every different context.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:12):**  Did you have another thing you wanted to instigate?  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:15):**  Maybe not instigate, but just two things that come to mind.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:18):**  And first off, yeah, I agree, Neil, the feedback loop of design with Nikos, I think, I personally  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:27):**  think we maybe have gone one a bit too many support plants, but that's good because now  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:33):**  we can observe that one and maybe the next one would try with a fewer.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:37):**  So the family thing, like you said, Oliver, and depending on the family circumstances  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:41):**  and how actively they work the land, someone might want baskets of tree tomatoes.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:46):**  And that kind of brings me to, well, first two little thoughts, you know, Mollison said  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:39:54):**  that diversity decreases as you move farther into higher zones.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:00):**  So your zone one vegetable garden and herb garden may have a hundred species of plants.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:05):**  And then as you go out from there, zone two may have 20 and by zone three, it's hard to  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:08):**  manage that diversity.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:11):**  And also just to question where you want to be on the scale of diversity versus efficiency,  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:21):**  because there is a trade off between the two.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:23):**  So those two things have come to mind through this discussion.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:28):**  I think one of the unique things about this, and it goes along with what you were saying  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:31):**  at the beginning of this about NGOs, many projects that get started, especially in developing  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:38):**  countries like this only really take into account one part of the project.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:42):**  And usually that's the installation or the instigation of that project.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:45):**  So yes, we're going in and installing these diverse polycultures, focusing on the preservation  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:52):**  of heritage avocados, but we live here and we're going to be around here for quite a  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:40:57):**  few years, constantly checking in with our neighbors and observing how each of these  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:02):**  systems evolves in each of their different contexts.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:06):**  So we are planning on seeing this through much further than just the season in which  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:13):**  we implement a bunch of systems, but actually working with the community that we are residents  
**[0:41:17-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:17):**  of to see that it actually works the way it was intended and it works for the people that  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:24):**  this was given to.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:25):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:26):**  I mean, there's a couple of points there.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:29):**  You know, one takes me back to what Chad was saying at the start of the interview about  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:33):**  why he got disillusioned with NGOs and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:39):**  And you know, it was a similar experience for me.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:41):**  I ended up doing a master's in development studies.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:46):**  I really focused on like the sustainable development angle.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:41:53):**  And it starts to look like an oxymoron after a while, this concept of developing places.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:01):**  And I think both Chad and I had like quite strong sort of resistances to being, you know,  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:09):**  these gringos who are like doing a community project because so often you see those projects  
**[0:42:15-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:15):**  have all these unintentional, unintended side effects, you know.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:23):**  And so really this project is the culmination of a long time of like soul searching and  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:31):**  observation.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:34):**  And for good reason we're choosing to do it in the place that we live because we want  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:38):**  to be there to see how these living systems respond.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:43):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:46):**  And I think just also not rushing it.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:53):**  I think that's really important for us.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:42:56):**  How Neil mentioned we both have some experience working in the nonprofit world and kind of  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:01):**  had our challenges with it.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:02):**  And I agree 100% it's the unintended consequences of these projects that they often just get  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:08):**  left out.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:09):**  And now that we're talking about our idea and actually putting it into practice, I'm  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:14):**  really kind of going through in my mind.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:17):**  We've been having good discussions about what are the unintended consequences of this project.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:22):**  We could talk about that.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:23):**  And two other things I wanted to touch on are that I think we need to learn more about  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:29):**  the avocado.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:30):**  That's like one thing.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:32):**  And the other thing is I would like to discuss a little bit about the process after it's  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:38):**  planted like that we're basically mapping out the lands, getting the coordinates, that  
**[0:43:44-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:44):**  whole process.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:46):**  Yeah, 100% a huge part of our jobs now that we've committed to doing this will be in  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:52):**  research.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:43:54):**  And on putting systems in place so that we can observe the consequences of our work.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:01):**  So you know we're going to map out every parcel that we plant and we're going to map out planting  
**[0:44:10-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:10):**  densities and then we're going to take record, we're going to record management practices  
**[0:44:16-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:16):**  and we're going to record all those metrics and observe the different things as they evolve  
**[0:44:24-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:24):**  so that we can put in a system and a management schedule that's as effective as possible.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:35):**  And then we, yeah for sure, we both have a lot of study to do specifically on avocados.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:40):**  So I guess I would like use this as a shout out to anyone who knows avocados, anything  
**[0:44:46-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:46):**  about avocados, you know send us and plant breeding, send us any cool resources you think  
**[0:44:53-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:53):**  you have because this is going to be you know a big area and I'm excited about it, you know,  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:44:59):**  I love avocados that helps.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:02):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:05):**  I'm glad you made that shout out to anyone listening if you know any good books or anywhere  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:11):**  to start.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:12):**  For me I think it's going to be important to standardize a lot of the approaches like  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:16):**  standardize the planting technique of the avocado tree so we know they all get planted  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:20):**  the same way.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:23):**  Standardizing what support plants even if we change like which ones actually appear  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:27):**  but standardizing the ratio of like how many bananas for each avocado and then playing  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:33):**  with it but having some like guidelines around that.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:38):**  And I also, you know, I think this map to me just is really exciting to that we just  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:45):**  each parcel we have is like a GPS point.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:49):**  The land itself has a base map that we create with each of the varieties of avocados labeled  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:54):**  on the base map.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:45:55):**  And we talked about this before Neil but I think this is this exciting idea of this communal  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:00):**  managed, communally managed zone three kind of productive farm is basically what you called  
**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:06):**  it Neil.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:07):**  Can you talk about that?  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:08):**  Yeah sure.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:09):**  I mean that that's super exciting to me because when I when I think about social permaculture  
**[0:46:15-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:15):**  and like really making the ripples spread out, you know, resilient communities I think  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:24):**  have to have that sort of like shared zone three kind of commons area.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:31):**  And you know anyone who's ever read like Tragedy of the Commons you do see how there's been  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:36):**  this kind of like almost cannibalistic way in which sort of share lands that everyone  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:41):**  benefits from that just sort of gets eroded away.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:47):**  And for me it's also I'm so passionate about agroforestry and all this idea of like producing  
**[0:46:53-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:46:53):**  our food mainly from tree crops and perennial species, you know, that's so that's so important  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:00):**  to me but being able to kind of do it in a way that doesn't involve acquiring a huge  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:07):**  amount of land, you know, especially in a country that has had a lot of issues with  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:14):**  foreigners coming in and buying up huge tracts of land and not that I'm necessarily against  
**[0:47:18-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:18):**  that but as a way of starting it off and making sure that this agroforestry initiative in  
**[0:47:24-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:24):**  particular is bringing equal benefit across the community or at least as much as we can  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:30):**  spread it out.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:33):**  Yeah because I agree with that I think you know also touching back to these unintended  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:38):**  consequences I mean for me I kind of think about it well worst case some people just  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:43):**  completely neglect the parcel, okay, that might happen in which case a lot of the trees  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:48):**  may still survive and we have good like ideas of which varieties are better you know at  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:54):**  being abandoned and still surviving.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:47:57):**  You know some people you know there is an element of handout isms in here.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:06):**  The way the project works in a bit more detail is we actually offer a two week full pay for  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:12):**  someone from the family who owns the land one week to do the preparation of clearing  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:17):**  and meeting with us to find the family's goals and make the design and then the second week  
**[0:48:22-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:22):**  of his work is working alongside us and we invite the whole family to come but we promise  
**[0:48:25-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:25):**  a salary for working their land and we also are distributing these trees which are paid  
**[0:48:31-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:31):**  for by the project.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:33):**  So there is a little bit of this risk of giving things out but I think the fact that they're  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:38):**  planting along with us and we're speaking about the maintenance which is expected for  
**[0:48:42-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:42):**  like them to do that could be another potential drawback but what I, well yeah you want to  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:49):**  say something Neil?  
**[0:48:50-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:50):**  Yeah I mean on the handout thing I have thought about that but then you know I see it a little  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:48:56):**  bit differently I mean farmers in the states get handouts from the government to plant  
**[0:49:01-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:01):**  Monsanto seeds and technological packets of pesticides and fertilizers and maybe that's  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:11):**  great you know maybe the US government are just absolutely hitting the nail on the head  
**[0:49:15-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:15):**  by subsidizing and giving handouts for those processes but I don't share that opinion I  
**[0:49:21-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:21):**  would prefer to charge money for this service which is an educational volunteer service  
**[0:49:28-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:28):**  and have that money go as a kind of a subsidy as a switch to ecologically appropriate agroforestry  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:37):**  and again the worst case scenario for me is those parcels get abandoned but a bunch of  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:42):**  trees still grow we learn a bunch of stuff from it the earthworks get done and worst  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:47):**  case scenario loads of birds feast on raccoons and squirrels feast on the avocados you know  
**[0:49:53-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:53):**  that's not terrible.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:49:56):**  No that's true that's you know part of the design for this project is that there's very  
**[0:50:02-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:02):**  few downsides worst case scenarios are pretty minimal here nobody's going to really be unfortunate  
**[0:50:09-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:09):**  if this doesn't work out the way it was initially intended and I know for myself that I'm really  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:16):**  looking forward to helping to design the systems that take information from this so that we  
**[0:50:20-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:20):**  can take this model and replicate it in other places.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:23):**  I know Shad you were talking about you know getting proper maps of all the places GPS  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:28):**  locations and I you know would really looking forward to kind of collaborating on how to  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:34):**  put together systems for checkup and maintenance to see how these things are progressing along  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:39):**  to see how quickly they come to harvest even the economic impacts if it helps to add some  
**[0:50:45-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:45):**  income for these families if it helps the diversity and the health of their coffee plants  
**[0:50:53-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:53):**  and things that were already there those differences and those changes are the information that  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:50:58):**  I'm really looking forward to getting and definitely will be sharing in the future as  
**[0:51:00-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:00):**  well.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:01):**  Yeah and you know a few other things that I'm really excited about is you know I hope  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:10):**  you know if we start we've been talking about maybe 10 varieties that we select so we go  
**[0:51:15-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:15):**  through the valley talk with a bunch of local avocado experts just Sununah community members  
**[0:51:21-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:21):**  that just know the trees and know the best tasting avocados we select 10 really there's  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:27):**  just this excitement for me of like finding that one or two superstar trees there's ones  
**[0:51:33-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:33):**  that are just super hardy and productive with low inputs and like really delicious avocado  
**[0:51:39-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:39):**  that fruits maybe multiple times a year or maybe it's fruiting when very few other cottos  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:45):**  or other avocados are in season to finding that superstar is like real exciting part  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:50):**  of this project for me as well and just thinking you know 10 years from now if we manage to  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:51:56):**  plant 200 or 300 of these trees a year in five years we have over you know over a thousand  
**[0:52:02-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:02):**  trees that will hopefully be starting to produce my dream would be that you have some sort  
**[0:52:09-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:09):**  of cooperative of the local people bringing all these products together because there's  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:14):**  some uniformity and getting a really good price for them which would be you know on  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:20):**  top of the natural resource conservation and ecosystem enhancement is now an economic benefit  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:26):**  that I think is totally high potential for.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:31):**  I mean yeah I totally share that vision and for me it's so fundamental because finding  
**[0:52:38-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:38):**  ways of showing people that planting trees is has all because a lot of people don't see  
**[0:52:45-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:45):**  the immediate benefits of like sequestering carbon and providing habitat for animals even  
**[0:52:51-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:51):**  though I think people are starting to realize that more and more but I think this idea of  
**[0:52:59-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:52:59):**  community cooperatives based around agroforestry or productive tree species is it's fundamentally  
**[0:53:09-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:09):**  I think very important you know.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:12):**  Yeah and I will say you know we've been talking about this and I'm glad we dedicated so much  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:16):**  time to this roundtable for this project because I think all of us are just super pumped for  
**[0:53:21-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:21):**  it but I do just want to know we've had an amazing videographer here with us through  
**[0:53:25-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:25):**  last week just getting a lot of footage and capturing special moments of this project  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:31):**  where we did exactly what we've been talking about for the past 45 minutes and if you're  
**[0:53:36-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:36):**  curious to hear what the community thinks or what some of the Guatemalan facilitators  
**[0:53:42-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:42):**  have to say about the project sadly they don't speak English so they wouldn't be great to  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:48):**  have them on this particular podcast but on atilinercanics.com backslash service you'll  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:54):**  be able to see videos where we interview families who Nikos family who's received the work and  
**[0:53:59-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:53:59):**  also interviewing other people who are considering it as well as hearing from our other facilitator  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:54:05):**  Jose Armando and some of the Guatemalans who come for scholarships so you can also get  
**[0:54:10-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:54:10):**  their point of view if you're at all interested in learning more about the project.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:54:16):**  Yeah I think that's a pretty good place to wrap up certainly any of you listeners who  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:54:20):**  have been inspired or interested by this project can get in touch with us directly.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:54:25):**  Shad how can they get in touch with you and Atilinerganics?  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:54:29):**  Yeah before I mention exactly how I really do want to give a call one more time if you  
**[0:54:34-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:54:34):**  at all are interested in traveling to Latin America and if you are associated with or  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-5/#t=0:54:41):**  the leader of any group that might enjoy this sort of work please get in touch with us it

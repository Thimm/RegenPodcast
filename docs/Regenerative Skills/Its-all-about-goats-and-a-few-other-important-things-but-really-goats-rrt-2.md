**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:01:42):**  by talking about some of the things that we've been doing since our last recording. There's  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:01:46):**  been a lot happening with the development of the regenerative homestead model. So Neil,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:01:51):**  tell us one of the bigger things that's been happening over the last few weeks. Goats man,  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:01:58):**  it's all about goats. It's all about the goats. I don't care about anything else anymore.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:04):**  Yeah we got the goat system going. Mostly me and one other volunteer built the goat house.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:12):**  We were lucky because the bamboosaros were alongside building the house so they kind  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:18):**  of guided me. It was great to have Oliver here to kind of oversee the process and to  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:25):**  climb up on the roof and put on the roofing because I'm too old for that stuff. You're  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:30):**  not too old. You fell out of an avocado tree a couple of months ago and since then you're  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:37):**  traumatized for some reason. You don't seem to like heights anymore. I don't mind heights  
**[0:02:42-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:42):**  but falling out sucks. So take us through from the beginning. Tell us how the goat house  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:50):**  was designed to work mostly and how we've got that system running at the moment. So  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:02:57):**  the basics of the goat house design is we built it from offcuts from the bamboo project  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:04):**  and from leftover bamboo that Shad had. So we put it together nice and cheap but it's  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:08):**  a nice design because we built it to be closed along the bottom. So we've got these lepas  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:16):**  like offcuts from cypress trees and that's make the walls and then it's open along the  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:22):**  top part and it's got a bamboo frame so that it has nice airflow I guess that's the main  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:28):**  thing that I'd say about it. It's nice and safe. The goats can't get out of it. Not that  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:32):**  they really even want to once they're in there because it's so nice and it just looks like  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:36):**  a really it's an attractive looking structure and the goats are really happy and the deep  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:40):**  bedding is a big part of it so we put straw down underneath them pretty much every day  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:46):**  and then eventually that will have a chicken house built adjacent to it which I think is  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:51):**  a great design because as we know from looking at animal system omnivore always follows her  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:03:59):**  before right so like having the one of the things I'm most excited about the goats is  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:05):**  how they graze and the things they graze on like they go out and I spent a lot of time  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:12):**  walking with them over the last couple of months and they go out and they they graze  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:17):**  all these vines all these pioneer species they really look for minerals that's what  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:23):**  goats do they have very high mineral requirements I think the highest of all domesticated herbivores  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:30):**  so I see them as going around and just collecting all these nutrients and then depositing them  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:35):**  back on our land which we catch with the straw but they do compact that they do compact their  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:40):**  bedding and it goes a little bit anaerobic and when you clean out a goat house it's a  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:44):**  little bit gnarly but we've got a big door that opens up in the back of it which will  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:49):**  open out into our chicken house so once every few months I figure we'll empty the goat house  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:04:55):**  down into the chicken house which will then empty will empty the and the chickens will  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:05:00):**  just attack it it'll be full of little bugs and worms that they'll just love to feast  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:05:05):**  on and then that will be emptied out again and then the whole thing is built alongside  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:05:10):**  our garden so the chickens will be able to be we put it we're putting a lot of fencing  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:05:15):**  in we're going to fence off our food forest areas so we build a chicken house with several  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:05:19):**  doors and so we're able to send them to different places the garden being one and all that compost  
**[0:05:24-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:05:24):**  will end up in our in our garden in our in our trees and for me it's really I think this

**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:05:37):**  to re-mineralize soil and a lot of like kind of like complicated bio-ferments and all these  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:05:44):**  things you can do with rock salts and they're all great for sure but for me it's so low

**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:06:41):**  zone four kind of riparian zones how is it helpful for the having the goats there is

**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:15:17):**  but just like Neil was talking about cut down any unnecessary work or routine that can be

**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:15:55):**  the pathways for energy for sources that we get on our property to make their way through

**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:16:07):**  Another source is our volunteer labor that we have going and going on right now.

**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:16:14):**  Well we get people here that are really interested to learn and help us and we try to get them

**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:25:20):**  on straw or some kind of media like that.

**[0:26:24-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:26:24):**  have to buy new spawn all the time with vigorous genetics in it.

**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:26:36):**  Basically that means that you have to constantly feed this thing and take out bits of it.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:26:41):**  So we have this box that we created.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:26:44):**  We put this this this hay with mycelium in it in there with pasteurized hay in just 10

**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:26:59):**  Once that grows out we take two thirds of that split that up into buckets or something

**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:27:15):**  Basically if we keep doing this the mother will go on forever.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:27:18):**  She'll keep consuming more hay keep producing new fruiting buckets for us.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:27:24):**  But the trick is that we have to keep her from fruiting which means we have to keep

**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:29:02):**  we got the goats was we set up a yogurt making station and Adriana is just nailing it with  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:29:07):**  not just with.

**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:29:14):**  milk gets produced per day how much yogurt gets sold how much gets turned into cheese

**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:29:24):**  we spent this much on time walking them we produced this much.

**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:30:07):**  from the beginning and design accordingly.

**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:30:28):**  So we're at this kind of sort of pivotal point with the mushrooms too they're not at production  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:30:34):**  level yet.

**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:30:41):**  trying we're getting mushrooms in the kit for to fry and have with our eggs in the morning

**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:31:03):**  designers manual that says the yield of the system is limited only by your imagination

**[0:31:41-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:31:41):**  a few systems that are economically viable and then having a whole diverse ecosystem

**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:31:54):**  dependent on as a primary enterprise or profit so really decision making ways it's important

**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:32:15):**  goats are an open tap and they can't really you can't be like ah we'll just kind of like

**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:32:24):**  then same with the mushrooms if we forget about them for a while they're gone and like  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-its-all-about-goats-and-a-few-other-important-things-but-really-goats-regenerative-round-table-2-057/#t=0:32:27):**  we don't get it back yeah I mean we can get new ones in here but like you know we're not

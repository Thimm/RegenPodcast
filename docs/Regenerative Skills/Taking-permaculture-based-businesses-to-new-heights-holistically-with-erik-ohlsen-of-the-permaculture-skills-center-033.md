**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:25):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:28):**  In this episode I got to interview one of my personal heroes, Eric Olson.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:33):**  Now Eric wears a lot of hats.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:35):**  He's the founder and director of both Permaculture Artisans, a landscape and design company,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:40):**  and the Permaculture Skill Center, an amazing trade school based in Sebastopol, California.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:45):**  Eric also writes and publishes books for adults and children in his company's storyscapes.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:51):**  Now in this interview Eric talks in detail about how he's built synergy and connection  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:55):**  into all of his business endeavors, and we talk about how he's designed the courses for  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:01:59):**  the Permaculture Skill Center to include mentoring, and also the profound effect that mentorships  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:04):**  have had on his own journey.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:07):**  We also get into the skills that aspiring permaculturists should work to build that  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:11):**  aren't necessarily taught in a PDC.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:14):**  This session is chock full of practical insights and advice, so I'll let Eric take it from  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:18):**  here.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:19):**  Hey Eric, it's such a pleasure to have you on the podcast here today.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:23):**  Thanks for being here.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:24):**  Oh, my pleasure.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:25):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:26):**  Cool.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:27):**  Well, before we dive into the deep end with all the questions, could you start by telling  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:31):**  us a bit about yourself and how you got into permaculture and landscape design?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:35):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:37):**  So I'm Eric Olson.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:39):**  I'm up here in Northern California, and I've been doing permaculture since I was 18.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:46):**  Really got drawn into the movement through an activist point of view.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:51):**  Up north here is – we have a lot of old-growth redwoods, and they've been – many of them  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:56):**  have been cut down.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:02:58):**  So that really sort of turned me on to people showing up to make an impact in our community  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:04):**  to protect our ecologies.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:06):**  That just kind of led from one thing to another to learning about the plight of our planet  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:12):**  and our ecosystems and always being in a mindset of solutions.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:20):**  My friends and I started a nonprofit organization.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:23):**  I was 19 at the time called Planting Earth Activation.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:28):**  What we did was gave community gardens away to our community.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:32):**  We would even shut down neighborhoods where we would get all the neighbors in a block  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:39):**  to agree to have their front yard lawns turned into gardens.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:43):**  We were really focused on saving seeds back then.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:46):**  So as young activists, gardener, youth, some of the permaculture folks in the area, in  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:03:55):**  the Bay Area, sort of discovered us and took us under their wings.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:00):**  So I took my first permaculture course in 1999, and that really changed my life forever.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:07):**  Gave me a context for thinking about solutions, gave me a pattern and a set of principles  
**[0:04:15-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:15):**  for design, for how I walk through the world, how I walk on the land.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:24):**  I've always been one of these people that took the concepts of permaculture and the  
**[0:04:28-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:28):**  principles of permaculture not just to the garden and to the landscape, but also to social  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:35):**  organizing.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:38):**  In the last decade, more economic organizing as well.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:44):**  So after doing a lot of activist work in the early 2000s, I joined up with the global justice  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:52):**  movement, traveled around the planet chasing the World Trade Organization, the G8 and other  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:04:57):**  meta institutions that were creating policy around agriculture, around water, around intellectual  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:05:04):**  property and so many things.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:05:08):**  What kept coming up for me was a need to put a big spotlight on solutions.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:05:15):**  I feel that's really where permaculture can excel is by providing a platform for integrating  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:05:25):**  humans back into the ecology and doing it in such a way where we're taking care of each  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:05:29):**  other and regenerating our communities.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:05:33):**  So then something kind of crazy happened and I like to talk a lot about self-care these  
**[0:05:42-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:05:42):**  days because of it, but right at the peak of my activist endeavors, I got hit with a  
**[0:05:52-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:05:52):**  physical condition and in that process of that, I got sick and I couldn't actually continue  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:00):**  doing the activist work in the same way.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:04):**  And so this became kind of a personal transformation moment for myself because I've always been  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:10):**  about impact.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:11):**  My goal, what's driven me this whole time for the past 20 years has been having the  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:17):**  greatest impact for the good.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:23):**  So what happened at that point was I got really depressed because I thought, well, I can't  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:28):**  do this important activist work.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:31):**  What do I have to give my community, the global community to be of service for regeneration?  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:40):**  And out of that, I started my landscape contracting company, Permaculture Artisans, really out  
**[0:06:47-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:47):**  of necessity because I needed to pay my rent and put food on my table beyond what I was  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:06:55):**  growing and just the basic bills and things that I needed to take care of.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:01):**  So I needed to make some money somehow.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:04):**  And so I started my landscape contracting company and this really amazing thing happened  
**[0:07:08-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:08):**  was that in the very first year of Permaculture Artisans, we planted more fruit trees and  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:17):**  built more water harvesting systems than in three or four years of nonprofit work.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:22):**  And in that process, we were actually getting paid at that point what felt like a living  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:30):**  wage.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:31):**  I was paying myself that.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:32):**  I hired some friends on.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:33):**  They were getting paid well.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:35):**  And as an activist, you really – at that time in my life anyway and the kind of activist  
**[0:07:41-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:41):**  work I was doing, it was really a scarcity model and kind of a real concern about how  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:50):**  I was going to cover my expenses each month.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:53):**  And that created a bit of stress just around the financial needs of like just covering  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:07:58):**  my basic needs.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:00):**  And so as starting a business, which was really challenging mentally for me because I was  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:06):**  pretty anti-business at the time but I did it out of necessity, what was shocking to  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:12):**  me was how it actually became kind of a social benefit opportunity because now, not only  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:19):**  was I stepping out of like all the stress around scarcity, which allowed me to focus  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:25):**  on solutions, but then I was able to hire friends and hire other folks in the community  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:29):**  who are coming from low-income backgrounds and give them really awesome work, really  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:35):**  high-valued work in the community, building soil, catching water, growing food, connecting  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:40):**  people with the landscape.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:42):**  And they were able to get their basic needs met as well.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:46):**  And so through that sort of transformation of creating this new business, I kind of had  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:52):**  this realization and it's been with me ever since.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:08:57):**  And the realization is that we need to create a regenerative economy.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:09:04):**  We need to create economic systems that are healing our landscapes and taking care of  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:09:11):**  people and that this is kind of an important leverage point right now in our times because  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:09:18):**  we live in a money-based system currently.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:09:22):**  And so I noticed so many people are just struggle just to make their basic income needs.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:09:28):**  And if you look, any of us who understand climate change, understand soil depletion,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:09:36):**  understand all of the ecological disasters that are happening on the planet right now,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:09:41):**  let alone the social disasters of poverty, war, famine, so much of these terrible things  
**[0:09:51-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:09:51):**  have really happened through human activity, human land use, human corporate-driven profit-making,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:03):**  capitalist endeavors.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:04):**  And there's so much repair now that needs to happen.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:09):**  There's so much restoration that needs to occur.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:15):**  I always put this question out there.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:20):**  What if the majority of the people who are working for money on the planet right now,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:26):**  what if they were actively restoring environments and communities?  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:32):**  What if that was the basis for our economy, building soil, sequestering carbon, cleaning  
**[0:10:38-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:38):**  and catching water, growing food, providing healthcare and support for each other?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:46):**  What if our economy was built on that rather than the destructive forces that it's been  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:50):**  for the last 100 years?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:52):**  And so that's really turned me on to explore this notion of how we can create regenerative  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:10:58):**  economies and really has led me down the road to creating some other social ecological-based  
**[0:11:04-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:04):**  businesses and training programs to help people get their activity to direct people's energies  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:16):**  towards regeneration.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:18):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:20):**  I mean that really flips the growing population model on its head too.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:24):**  If it were increasing the workforce that was going towards regenerative measures, all of  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:30):**  a sudden an infinitely growing population is a good thing instead of something that  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:35):**  drains our resources.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:37):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:40):**  There's so much regenerative work to be done.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:44):**  At this point, I couldn't really see the end to that good work.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:49):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:50):**  So, let's talk a little bit about your business endeavors now.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:53):**  I know you do wear a lot of hats when it comes to both business and permaculture.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:11:58):**  You founded, like you said, the Permaculture Artisans Landscape Design Company.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:02):**  You have the Permaculture Skills Center which is a vocational training center for all aspects  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:07):**  of regenerative ecosystem design.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:10):**  And you've even got Storyscapes where you've published numerous books for children and  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:13):**  adults.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:14):**  So, first off, where in the world do you find time for all of this?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:19):**  And secondly, tell me about the inspirations for these endeavors and how they all work  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:24):**  together.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:25):**  Great.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:26):**  Thank you for those questions.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:28):**  I mean, first off, when it comes to having time to do things, I think it's important  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:33):**  to look at the cycle – my cycle with permaculture and these businesses.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:38):**  So, it's been about 20 years in the permaculture and activist movements doing this work.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:45):**  Permaculture Artisans has been around for about 12 years.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:49):**  Permaculture Skills Center will be going into our fifth year with that company.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:12:55):**  And Storyscapes, we're just crossed the one-year mark for that one.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:01):**  And so, it takes time first and foremost to develop a business that can thrive on its  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:09):**  own.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:10):**  And I would say it took about eight years before I felt like Permaculture Artisans was  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:16):**  really able to thrive on its own.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:19):**  And the Permaculture Skills Center, we're still a little bit in the struggle of figuring  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:26):**  out what the right recipe for that organization is going to be so it can also thrive.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:33):**  So, I used to really charge ahead quickly on things.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:39):**  And I guess I still do that.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:41):**  A friend of mine once told me that I bulldoze into life, which might be a good metaphor  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:46):**  for me.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:47):**  Just kind of move quickly.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:50):**  But what I've been learning in the recent years is it's okay to take some time to develop  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:13:55):**  really strong foundation for a new business or a new project.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:00):**  And that the time it takes to really establish that foundation will provide returns for years  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:08):**  and years to come.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:09):**  And so, I'm really focusing on foundational work right now to create a stronger base for  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:14):**  some of these organizations.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:17):**  I like that you asked about how these businesses integrate with each other because I never  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:22):**  look at any one of my businesses as just a separate entity, although they are legally  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:29):**  separate in the eyes of the state, I guess.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:33):**  But we see them as a organism or a guild of businesses that are working and supporting  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:41):**  each other.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:42):**  So, for instance, some of our highly trained and experienced foremen and designers at Permaculture  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:50):**  Artisans provide educational services to some of our students at the Permaculture Skill  
**[0:14:55-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:14:55):**  Center who are showing up to learn about ecological landscaping and how great it is to just have  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:03):**  experienced people right there on site to be able to learn from.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:09):**  And we've even hired straight out of our classes right into our design company.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:15):**  So there's a bit of a revolving door happening there.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:20):**  And as we look at this, kind of go from pattern to detail.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:24):**  So if we step out to the pattern, we can see a pattern where we're providing design and  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:34):**  physical implementation of ecological landscapes and regenerative farms through Permaculture  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:40):**  Artisans, but that also becomes a networking hub.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:44):**  As students come out of the Permaculture Skill Center, they're out getting their own jobs.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:49):**  They can lean on Permaculture Artisans for support.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:53):**  And we often have a lot of collaborations that happen that way.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:15:56):**  So there's a community building aspect to it.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:00):**  But then the Permaculture Skill Center is more than just a vocational training center.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:04):**  We are also incubating farmers there.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:07):**  So we currently have three farmers on site.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:11):**  Two of them are incubated farmers.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:13):**  One of them, Red Age Farm.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:16):**  Katie at Red Age Farm, she's an established farmer who's been growing for many years and  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:21):**  has an established market.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:23):**  And so not only do we want to educate people, but we actually want to provide opportunities.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:29):**  We want to provide land access.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:31):**  We want to support people in developing their businesses.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:34):**  So our current goal isn't just about educating people and then sending them off.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:42):**  And I'm currently working on some systems where we can provide ongoing mentorship to  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:48):**  people because what I find is as people want to build their regenerative enterprises, they're  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:55):**  not always able to do that just from taking a course.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:16:58):**  They need ongoing support and mentorship and networking.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:03):**  And it can take a few years to really get off the ground.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:06):**  So part of our goal is to provide that at the Permaculture Skill Center and then to  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:11):**  be a model, a demonstration site of everything regenerative from water harvesting to composting  
**[0:17:18-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:18):**  systems, to food forests, to alternative energy systems, herbal medicine, ecological farming.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:28):**  We've been creating this demonstration site for the past few years and it's completely  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:33):**  open to the public.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:34):**  And that was really important for me when we started the Permaculture Skill Center because  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:39):**  so many of the permaculture institutions and organizations in the area are by appointment  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:46):**  only or they're kind of like off in the woods, which is beautiful if you can get there, if  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:51):**  you could take one of their courses.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:52):**  It's absolutely amazing.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:17:54):**  But we wanted to be a little more central, a bit more accessible to the Bay Area and  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:00):**  where people could just stop in and go for self-guided tours and connect with farmers  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:06):**  and connect with students.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:07):**  And so that's been evolving really nicely.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:11):**  And then how does Storyscapes and how does the storytelling work itself into it?  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:17):**  One of the most greatest priorities in my life right now are my children who are seven  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:24):**  and nine.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:25):**  And they've had the privilege unlike I've had or many people I know have had, which  
**[0:18:30-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:30):**  is that they are literally growing up in a permaculture food forest.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:38):**  Ever since they were babies, they could walk out and eat strawberries and fruit and be  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:44):**  in an environment that's full of butterflies and birds and bees.  
**[0:18:49-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:18:49):**  And I feel this is a vital component of how we design and implement a regenerative future  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:01):**  is looking to the children.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:03):**  And the more that our young generations can grow up in the garden, grow up on the farm,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:11):**  grow up on the land, the more opportunities they have to do that, there's an intuition  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:19):**  I feel that that is going to bode well for the future of humanity and the planet.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:26):**  And so more and more we've been looking at, well, since there's not a lot of youth have  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:31):**  that opportunity, so many of our young people live in cities without access to land, without  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:38):**  access to gardens.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:40):**  And how do we ignite that curiosity and that connection so that our children and our young  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:47):**  people can build that relationship with the land?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:53):**  And so that's why I wrote some of our children's, some of these children's books through Storyscapes.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:19:58):**  And we actually created two coloring books as well, two adult coloring books as a way  
**[0:20:03-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:03):**  for families to come together to color and read, learn about ecosystems, learn about  
**[0:20:13-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:13):**  farming and be able to do that from the dinner table or from the comfort of their own home  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:22):**  just as a way to start reaching out and making some of these connections.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:27):**  And then on the flip side of that, how do we really get the children out?  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:32):**  And one of the things we've done at the Permaculture Skill Center, we started to bring school groups  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:35):**  out there.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:36):**  So last year we had kindergarten classes and third grade classes coming out on a regular  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:43):**  basis.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:44):**  In fact, we had a third grade class come out once a month and learn all about farming and  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:49):**  permaculture and ecological landscaping.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:51):**  They saved seed, they propagated plants, they planted fruit trees and put in drip irrigation  
**[0:20:58-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:20:58):**  systems, they harvested herbs and did all kinds of crafts from the garden.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:08):**  So that priority, that focus of giving children and the next generation that opportunity to  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:15):**  learn these skills.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:16):**  We live in such a fast-paced environment now with all the technology and the smartphones  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:22):**  and computers and all that.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:25):**  How do we push back on some of that technological distraction?  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:32):**  One thing I noticed is that when my kids are out playing in the food forest, my daughter  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:37):**  will go out and she could easily get lost for an hour just discovering new flowers and  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:43):**  picking and trying different fruits.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:45):**  Right now, we probably have about 10 different heirloom fruits that are ripe in the food  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:52):**  forest.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:54):**  Every day, she'll go out and she'll eat a pluot and she'll go harvest an Asian pear  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:21:58):**  and she'll pick some apples off the ground and she'll find the best strawberries.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:03):**  All children deserve to have that kind of experience and access.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:09):**  I'm just always in the realm, always asking that question of how can we up our game as  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:13):**  a global community to give our children those kinds of relationships that they can grow  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:19):**  with.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:20):**  Yeah, that's really beautiful.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:22):**  I agree wholeheartedly with that idea.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:24):**  I don't have children myself but my family, my extended family is always growing.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:29):**  My sister just had a little girl and I've been thinking a lot about how I can provide  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:33):**  those for my extended family, people in my community as I travel and stuff as well.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:38):**  I think that's a fantastic effort.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:41):**  So switching gears just a little bit here, going back to the Permaculture Skill Center.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:48):**  One of the main reasons I initially wanted to reach out to you was to find out more about  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:52):**  the Skill Center and how you've designed the programs in order to train the next generation  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:56):**  of regenerative landscape designers.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:22:58):**  I know you touched on this a little bit already but could you tell us a bit about how the  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:02):**  center got started and the needs that it aims to address specifically?  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:07):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:09):**  After many years of teaching permaculture classes and working with people around the  
**[0:23:16-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:16):**  world, one glaring issue kept coming up and that was that many folks were going through  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:26):**  permaculture classes or they're coming out of ecology departments and colleges and stuff  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:31):**  and they're really excited about doing this work.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:36):**  But in most cases, folks didn't have any hands-on experience.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:43):**  They didn't have any business or organizational experience and so you have this pool of very  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:50):**  passionate, very turned on people who want to go out in the world and start regenerative  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:23:56):**  businesses or start farms or start nonprofits that do permaculture aid work and they didn't  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:02):**  actually have the skill sets to do those things.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:06):**  They had the passion, they had the interest but they didn't have the skill sets.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:09):**  I would often get these phone calls or people would stop in, oh Eric, do you have any openings  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:17):**  with permaculture artisans?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:18):**  I would love to work with you.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:20):**  I just want a hands-on experience.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:22):**  I just want to learn how to put a pond in.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:24):**  I just want to learn how to build a food forest or put in a water catchment system and I don't  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:30):**  know where to go to get those skills.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:36):**  Over the years, I've worked with a lot of different nonprofits and I kind of talked  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:38):**  with some of the different organizations I worked with to see if they would want to run  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:43):**  advanced vocational training programs.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:46):**  In most cases, a lot of the nonprofits I worked with, they didn't really want to touch it  
**[0:24:52-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:24:52):**  because they had existing programs that were meeting their needs and the complexity of  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:01):**  creating a vocational training just seemed a little too complex.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:07):**  After a few years of really dreaming about creating a vocational training school where  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:15):**  participants get hands-on experience, like fully developing systems, it takes time to  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:22):**  put in a water catchment system.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:25):**  You're not going to learn that in one day.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:27):**  It's going to take multiple days to learn how to make the plumbing connections and place  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:32):**  a tank or site a swale correctly in relationship to a lot of other surface water flow management  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:39):**  systems.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:42):**  I was asking this question of how do we create educational opportunities for people that  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:46):**  really, really learn this stuff, but not just learn how to do the hands-on side, but also  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:51):**  learn the social and business skills required to be able to create businesses of their own  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:25:58):**  or successful nonprofits or endeavors of their own.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:01):**  I mean, the word business can be translated in different ways for different people depending  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:07):**  on their point of view.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:09):**  For me, we're basically talking about having the organizational abilities to design and  
**[0:26:16-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:16):**  implement projects, whether it be farms or landscapes or community gardens that are successful,  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:24):**  which in almost every case requires some kind of resources, often money.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:30):**  It requires organizing people.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:32):**  It requires being able to schedule correctly, having a good design, being able to pull off  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:37):**  the project.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:38):**  There's a lot that goes into creating a successful project, be it a business, a nonprofit, or  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:44):**  just a one-time thing.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:48):**  I noticed that there weren't a lot of places people could go to get all of that within  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:52):**  the context of permaculture.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:54):**  Sure, you could go learn business management.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:26:56):**  Sure, you can go learn organizational development.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:00):**  But to learn those things within the context of ecological principles with like-minded  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:08):**  folks, there haven't been a lot of those opportunities around.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:13):**  We started the Permaculture Skills Center specifically to address this growing gap in  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:20):**  the permaculture education globally.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:24):**  We launched this with two main programs.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:28):**  One was the Ecological Landscaper Immersion Program, which started out as a nine-month  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:34):**  intensive program and then went down to six months, and then a 10-week farm school, which  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:40):**  is now at 13 weeks.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:45):**  These two vocational training programs have been successful in a lot of ways.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:52):**  We've had a great big learning curve implementing these.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:27:59):**  It's been an interesting experience.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:00):**  I'm happy to share some of the ins and outs so that other people don't make some of the  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:04):**  mistakes that we made.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:07):**  First off, one thing that we're transitioning now is we won't be providing the Ecological  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:16):**  Landscaper Immersion Program anymore the way that it was organized.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:21):**  The reason for that is because six months, four days a week in Northern California is  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:28):**  a huge commitment for someone to make.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:30):**  It costs a lot of money to implement these programs because you want to get high-end  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:34):**  teachers who really have the experience.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:37):**  It can hold the community together.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:39):**  You have to pay them, and you have to pay for the site and all these things.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:42):**  There's a lot of overhead and expenses involved.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:46):**  One of the things that we realized is that people are coming from a lot of different  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:50):**  points of view in terms of doing this work.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:53):**  It's a beautiful diversity in how people are showing up in the social permaculture realm,  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:28:59):**  how people are addressing things like violence and racism through the lens of permaculture,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:05):**  and also folks who are coming from rural and land-tending backgrounds who want to professionalize  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:12):**  their work and just get to work, just get the projects done and get in there and do  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:19):**  amazing things.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:20):**  One of the things that we've noticed is that within this diversity, there's people who  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:27):**  want to learn different things.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:34):**  What we're looking at now is really receiving all the feedback that we've gotten from our  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:39):**  students, many of them who have gone on to do amazing, successful projects and campaigns  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:45):**  around the planet.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:48):**  We're looking at a new sort of model that can be more customizable for what people's  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:54):**  real needs are.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:29:56):**  I think in the last few years, what we're noticing globally is there's real diversity  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:04):**  within the permaculture movement.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:08):**  There's a lot of different facets, a lot of different ways people can enter into the movement.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:15):**  Here at the Permaculture Skills Center, we're looking at how do we serve this community.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:21):**  I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:23):**  I wanted to mention the Farm School because this is a really groundbreaking program that  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:27):**  we've run now for the last three years.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:30):**  At the Farm School, we're not only teaching people ecological farming practices, we're  
**[0:30:36-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:36):**  also teaching them how to read the landscape, assess a site, and design regenerative farms.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:44):**  They also get a business track.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:47):**  In this day and age, a lot of farmers need to be good business people, otherwise they're  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:52):**  not going to make it.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:30:55):**  Teaching them how to do good crop planning, how to set up spreadsheets, and create a thriving  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:03):**  farm enterprise.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:04):**  What's been amazing, really kind of mind-blowing, is the amount of students who've gone through  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:10):**  the Farm School and gone on to start their own farms.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:15):**  I'm so proud to say that a lot of these students who've gone on to start their own farms, they're  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:20):**  selling.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:21):**  They're selling food, they're selling vegetables, fruits, flowers, and they're making it.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:26):**  They have a strong foundation for their farm.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:30):**  That's just amazing in this day and age that small farmers can find a way to make it.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:36):**  It's really, in many ways, key to the future health of our societies that small farmers  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:44):**  can produce and make a living doing that work.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:48):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:49):**  That's a significant accomplishment, like you said, especially in this day and age.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:31:55):**  I've just been kind of blown away by how that program has evolved and made this great impact.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:03):**  What constantly comes up is how to serve the diversity of our community.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:13):**  I think that's where we're at right now in thinking about how to shift our programs in  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:19):**  such a way that they're more accessible.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:25):**  It's a big thing to hold a vocational school together.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:30):**  It's a lot of staff work.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:33):**  There's a lot of risk involved.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:38):**  We're in our fourth year running programs there and we're making some great transitions  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:44):**  here in the near future to address all that.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:48):**  Excellent.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:49):**  Well, so, I know one of the unique aspects that you offer through the school are mentorships.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:32:55):**  Could you tell me a little bit about the benefits of mentorships as people progress in their  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:00):**  visions and in their goals and a little bit too about how mentorships have affected you  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:04):**  in your own journey?  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:07):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:09):**  The mentor-mentee model is an age-old model.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:15):**  Thousands of years people have been learning and teaching in this way.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:20):**  And it is still, in my opinion, the most effective way for folks to learn a skill and to grow  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:28):**  and evolve and thrive in that skill.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:33):**  For myself, I never went to college.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:38):**  I got into permaculture at a young age, like I mentioned, and then was blessed to be mentored  
**[0:33:46-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:46):**  by folks like Penny Livingston, Brock Dolman, Starhawk, James Stark, among others, who really  
**[0:33:56-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:33:56):**  took me under their wing and gave me opportunities, put me in challenging situations, supported  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:05):**  me through that process, and also reflected when I was failing or when I was out of integrity  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:12):**  or where – helping to reflect where my growth edges were.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:17):**  So mentorship has – I've achieved what I've achieved today all because of my mentors.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:27):**  And I am who I am today because of the love and time that my mentors took with me.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:36):**  Sometimes every couple of years, I call up or get in touch with all my mentors who had  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:43):**  a big impact and I thank them.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:44):**  I still, to this day, feel immense gratitude for the time that they took with me.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:50):**  And now I've been placed in the role of being a mentor.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:34:54):**  And it's wonderful to see people work through their edges as they grow themselves, as they  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:01):**  learn new skills, as they take the risk to try a new project, to get a project done or  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:07):**  start a new business, and to be able to be there for those folks to help answer questions,  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:14):**  to help make connections when they need support has been just a huge privilege.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:20):**  And so at the Permaculture Skill Center, we really acknowledge how vital this component  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:26):**  to education is.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:28):**  And for the farm school, every student that comes out of the farm school gets paired with  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:33):**  a mentor for a six-month to one-year period of time after they leave the farm school.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:40):**  And part of what we're creating, and we're really in the process of fine-tuning this  
**[0:35:46-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:46):**  because it takes some time to set these relationships up, is we're not only doing this to serve  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:53):**  the student, but also to serve the elders.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:35:57):**  And I believe this is a key factor here, a vital point, which is the elders in our communities,  
**[0:36:05-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:05):**  after a time when an elder has done their thing, done their life's work, and I'm  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:13):**  really thinking about a lot of the farmers.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:17):**  After a while, these older farmers, they just don't have the physical chops to keep going.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:23):**  And they have all of this experience and all of this wisdom.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:27):**  And there aren't very many systems that, one, acknowledge the elders in our community  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:36):**  anymore, and give them a place, a dignified place where they can share their wisdom.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:42):**  And in many cases, as we see, at least in the United States and a lot of westernized  
**[0:36:48-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:48):**  cultures, our elders just end up getting put in senior homes and things like that.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:36:57):**  And are just kind of disconnected from the rest of society.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:02):**  I think this is a great loss to our communities because these older generations have so much  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:08):**  to share.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:09):**  So part of our goal is to build that connection between the elders and the new generation  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:15):**  of farmers in the farming field here, so that those older farmers, one, they can have a  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:22):**  second income because they need to get paid to be mentors.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:29):**  And often, most of the time, mentors are going to give their time away for free.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:32):**  But we just acknowledge that a lot of those older generations actually can find themselves  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:39):**  struggling, especially the farmers, when they can't get out there and do the farm work  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:42):**  anymore.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:43):**  Now they have to pay other people to do it.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:46):**  So give them some more job opportunities, a place where they can share their wisdom  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:52):**  and experience and really inspire the younger generation to have the resources.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:37:58):**  We don't all need to make the same mistakes all the time.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:01):**  A lot of the elders have already made those mistakes.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:05):**  If we could create communication systems where we can learn from them, all of our endeavors  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:10):**  are going to be much more successful.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:13):**  And then beyond how we said – yeah, go ahead.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:15):**  No, sure.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:16):**  That's just one of my favorite quotes, like a smart man learns from his mistakes but a  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:19):**  wise man learns from the mistakes of others.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:22):**  Yes.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:23):**  Oh, I love that.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:26):**  It's so true.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:28):**  So true.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:29):**  So to take this mentorship piece a bit further, what we're in the creation process of right  
**[0:38:37-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:37):**  now is creating an online and remote mentorship program.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:46):**  And I'm really, really excited about this because it's much more accessible to people  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:52):**  because they can do it right from their own homes, their own communities.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:38:55):**  And it's way more affordable than moving out to Sonoma County for nine months and taking  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:02):**  a nine-month program.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:04):**  And it becomes a lifetime mentorship relationship.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:08):**  So we're creating an online mentorship community, which we'll be launching at the end of October.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:15):**  It's called the Eco Landscape Mastery School.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:19):**  And through that system, we'll be linking people with mentors and providing sort of  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:27):**  like a bulk mentorship where as we build our online community, we'll have experts from  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:33):**  around the world come on and do live webinars and live chats, live conversations every single  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:40):**  month supporting people through their various processes.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:44):**  And we're in the back end right now developing all those systems.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:50):**  But ultimately, the goal is to provide cheap and affordable and accessible mentorship relationships  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:39:59):**  on a global level for the permaculture, ecological landscape and regenerative agriculture fields.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:06):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:07):**  Man, count me in whenever that starts.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:09):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:10):**  I would love to be a part of that.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:12):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:13):**  So, going a little bit more specific now, I know a lot of people who have finished their  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:19):**  PDCs, their permaculture design certificates and are now looking at ways to apply those  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:25):**  skills.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:26):**  What are some of the skills and training that you've noticed most people are lacking after  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:31):**  they finish their PDC that are kind of holding them back from becoming successful entrepreneurs?  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:38):**  I love this question Oliver because it's not what you think.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:42):**  It's not what most people think.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:45):**  Most people, they come out of the courses and I mean there's all kinds of things folks  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:49):**  are lacking.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:52):**  Having the hands-on experience to actually implement the systems people are designing.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:40:57):**  First and foremost, a permaculture design course does not give people enough experience  
**[0:41:03-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:03):**  or mentorship to go out there and build huge farms and ecological landscapes.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:11):**  In many ways, it could be quite dangerous for someone who doesn't have enough skills  
**[0:41:17-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:17):**  or enough experience to go out and try their hand at making major changes to Earth's environments.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:25):**  So, we kind of discourage people from going too big right out of a PDC.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:32):**  Start small so your mistakes are small and grow from there and get mentorship and support.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:37):**  But that's just one aspect to this.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:43):**  One layer is knowing how to build in some sites on the management of a large-scale project.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:54):**  If you're on a project with hundreds of acres or thousands of acres, how do you actually  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:41:59):**  create more of a problem and you're actually being regenerative?  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:02):**  Folks aren't going to get that right out of a PDC.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:04):**  They need a lot more.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:06):**  So that's one side of it.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:10):**  But there's actually something way deeper that comes up and it comes up in every single  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:16):**  one of the programs that we've run and it's the thing that we spend the most of our time  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:22):**  on.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:23):**  It's very counterintuitive.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:27):**  What that is, is people's ability to get out of their own way.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:37):**  What I mean by that is this goes straight to the personal development layer to this  
**[0:42:45-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:45):**  work.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:47):**  Individual to individual, the biggest obstacle that we see is that people don't think they're  
**[0:42:54-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:42:54):**  good enough or people are too afraid to take the necessary risks or to make the necessary  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:02):**  life changes that are required for them to be successful in creating their dream project  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:07):**  or whatnot.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:11):**  Time and time and time again, I see people sabotage themselves before they've even gotten  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:15):**  going.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:16):**  It takes time to learn.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:18):**  It takes time to get experience.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:20):**  It takes time to develop a successful project or a successful business.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:26):**  Time and time and time again, I see people give up before they've even really started.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:31):**  So many of the conversations revolve around what people think they need to learn versus  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:39):**  what they actually need to learn.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:42):**  It's really a mindset thing.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:44):**  In some ways, sometimes I question how well we're doing in permaculture at teaching people  
**[0:43:51-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:51):**  to actually be designers because if people are coming out of design courses thinking  
**[0:43:59-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:43:59):**  that they need a hand-holding through all these physical implementation systems, which  
**[0:44:06-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:44:06):**  they do, that's one thing, but what's even more vital is that folks learn how to read  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:44:19):**  patterns, learn how to understand relationships and ecosystems and communities, learn how  
**[0:44:26-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:44:26):**  to observe in a way where we can actually see the real patterns that are taking place.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:44:33):**  This really key component has been – I would attribute it to my success is being able to  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:44:42):**  go into situations where I know nothing but be in a place of awareness and in a place  
**[0:44:48-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:44:48):**  of observation and with humility and that practice of observation and humility and listening  
**[0:44:58-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:44:58):**  and awareness, that is actually the recipe for successful design and successful projects  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:06):**  because that's when the nuances of a system present themselves, the things that really  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:12):**  matter.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:16):**  This is a piece that I'm really focusing a lot on now with the new programs is how to  
**[0:45:21-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:21):**  support people in that internal process to quiet their mind and to open themselves up  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:30):**  to be able to really hear and observe the patterns that are taking place in a system  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:35):**  whether it be physical or social so that when we do move into a place of design or we do  
**[0:45:41-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:41):**  decide to make a physical change, to build terraces or to plant trees or whatnot that  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:51):**  we're doing that within understanding the context of the work that we're doing.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:45:57):**  That's actually I think more important than somebody learning how to build a rain catchment  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:01):**  system even though I think that those physical skills are also really key and we're really  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:06):**  focusing on that still at Permaculture Skill Center.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:10):**  It's this other side that seems to still be lacking.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:16):**  I would just go a degree further to say that the social skills, the communication skills  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:24):**  is a piece that it's almost like a crisis.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:30):**  People's inability to have compassionate and communication with each other and attentive  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:38):**  listening with each other is like this crisis especially in Western cultures that really  
**[0:46:43-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:43):**  needs to be remedied through some hard conversations.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:50):**  Those things take time and it takes time to set up those conversations.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:46:55):**  So surprisingly through all these vocational trainings and all of our programs, these are  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:01):**  the things that emerge as the key obstacles for people to get out of their own way.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:07):**  As my mentor Brock Dolman says, ecosystem restoration is easy but ego system restoration  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:16):**  is where all the work really needs to be had.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:20):**  I really love that you brought all this stuff up and especially because while all of these  
**[0:47:25-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:25):**  skills would contribute to being a successful designer especially in landscapes, frankly  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:31):**  they make you a better person and will make you more successful in life in general and  
**[0:47:37-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:37):**  regardless of whether you're trying to make a business out of a permaculture landscaping  
**[0:47:42-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:42):**  endeavor, anybody could benefit from learning to observe and listen and recognize patterns  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:49):**  and improve their social skills around that regardless of context.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:53):**  So I think that's really valuable advice.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:56):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:47:59):**  So with all of these varied projects and endeavors that you have going on, where do you see things  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:04):**  growing and evolving for you in the years to come?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:10):**  What we're doing now is really looking at a more global model of education and that  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:21):**  is seated in this new online school we're creating, the Eco Landscape Mastery School.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:28):**  Really, really excited about this because I feel like – I don't want people to feel  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:35):**  like they have to travel all the way to California to learn, to get the kind of mentorship and  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:41):**  the kind of learning that they need to be successful in creating their own landscape  
**[0:48:46-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:46):**  businesses, their regenerative farms and so on.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:49):**  And so the focus now is to build the online school and as part of that to build a robust  
**[0:48:58-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:48:58):**  coaching and mentorship program and as part of our system, we are creating a funding mechanism  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:10):**  for permaculture aid work globally.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:13):**  So how that's working is that when our online school is ready to take enrollment, 5% of  
**[0:49:26-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:26):**  the sales of people signing up for the school are going to go to a permaculture aid work  
**[0:49:33-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:33):**  project.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:35):**  And we'll be opening the doors to the school twice a year.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:40):**  So every time we launch a new enrollment period, we'll choose a different permaculture aid  
**[0:49:48-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:48):**  work project around the world to fund.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:51):**  So using the principles of permaculture to design how this whole system works, we want  
**[0:49:59-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:49:59):**  to one, support people where they are to get the kind of mentorship and skills they need  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:07):**  to build a regenerative economy, whether it be landscapes or farms or whatnot.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:11):**  Two, to create opportunity for mentors, for elders to share their experience in a dignified  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:26):**  way where they can get income at the same time as part of our online school, how we're  
**[0:50:32-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:32):**  developing our online school system.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:34):**  And then to three, to create a funding pathway for permaculture aid projects, which will  
**[0:50:40-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:40):**  inevitably turn into more than just funding.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:44):**  I guarantee there'll be designers and community members and support people who might want  
**[0:50:50-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:50):**  to show up for those projects if they're invited to really bolster the work where it needs  
**[0:50:58-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:58):**  to be done.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:50:59):**  Like I really admire the work you're doing, Oliver, in working in communities that really  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:07):**  need the solutions that permaculture has to offer.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:12):**  So we're looking at how do we create an education system that can do that.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:17):**  And then we're changing our programming at the Permaculture Skills Center.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:22):**  We're still be focusing on providing hands-on learning opportunities so people can actually  
**[0:51:29-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:29):**  gain the physical skills to do this work.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:32):**  But rather than putting those in the context of six and nine month programs, we're now  
**[0:51:37-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:37):**  focusing on one week advanced hands-on programs with specific outcomes.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:45):**  So next year, we'll have a one week Permaculture Earthworks Advanced Program.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:51):**  We'll have a one week Advanced Design Program.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:55):**  We'll have a, let's see, what are some other ones?  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:51:58):**  We're going to have a food forestry workshop.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:01):**  We're going to have a drip irrigation workshop.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:04):**  And again, the goal is to bring in the experts and the mentors in the community to teach  
**[0:52:09-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:09):**  these workshops.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:11):**  And then every single one of these will have a hands-on component.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:15):**  So we'll actually be building systems.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:19):**  People have the experience to see a system built from beginning to end and get that hands-on  
**[0:52:24-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:24):**  piece.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:25):**  But then the online program will provide all of the design, most of the design concepts.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:31):**  Understanding principles, building their businesses, having mentorship.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:35):**  And we've teamed up with Lift Economy, which is an amazing business coaching organization  
**[0:52:43-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:43):**  who I've worked with for many years.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:46):**  And they'll be providing coaching.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:48):**  We put together a coaching package so folks can actually get one-on-one coaching calls  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:52:54):**  with really amazing experience, permaculture business people to help get their projects  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:00):**  up and going.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:01):**  And then the last layer to that is that we'll be showcasing students' projects.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:07):**  So as people join our community, our online course in school, we'll be showcasing their  
**[0:53:14-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:14):**  projects and hopefully directing resources and mentors and support to people all over  
**[0:53:20-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:20):**  the world who need it and ask for it.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:23):**  Wow, that's amazing.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:25):**  Those sound like some really valuable programs.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:28):**  We've got one coming up as soon as October, is that correct?  
**[0:53:31-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:31):**  That's right.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:32):**  We're launching the first one October 25th.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:36):**  I'll leave all the – Oliver, I'll give you all the links and stuff like that.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:41):**  Yeah, I'll put all of those in the show notes at the end of this episode.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:44):**  Cool.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:45):**  Yeah, so we have one coming up in October.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:48):**  We're also creating an affiliate program with this where we're splitting 40% commissions  
**[0:53:54-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:54):**  to affiliates and everybody who signs up for the course can be an affiliate.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:53:58):**  So we're sort of trying to create a system where people – not only do they not have  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:05):**  to pay too much money but they can actually make money if they want to put their – put  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:10):**  some energy into it and see if we can share the abundance and share the surplus as much  
**[0:54:15-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:15):**  as possible.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:16):**  We are probably going to officially launch the early bird enrollment for that program  
**[0:54:23-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:23):**  in the next couple of weeks.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:24):**  So at the beginning of September, we'll be launching the early bird enrollment and  
**[0:54:30-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:30):**  then the course launches at the end of October.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:33):**  Man, that's fantastic.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:35):**  And hey, all of you listeners out there, definitely look out in the show notes on the website  
**[0:54:39-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:39):**  for this.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:40):**  I'll have all the links down in there so you can get in contact with them directly.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:43):**  Eric, before I let you go here, can you tell us how people can get in touch with you and  
**[0:54:47-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:47):**  find some of the resources you've just listed?  
**[0:54:50-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:50):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:51):**  So folks can get in touch with me.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:54:54):**  I have a website, erikolsen.com, E-R-I-K-O-H-L-S-E-N.com.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:00):**  So you can get in touch with me through there.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:02):**  And then we have – for permaculture artisans, there's permacultureartisans.com.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:06):**  That's the landscape contracting and design company.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:09):**  And then anyone – everyone is invited if you make it to Northern California to come  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:16):**  by the Permaculture Skills Center which is at the permacultureskillscenter.org.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:21):**  We're in Sebastopol, California and folks can show up.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:25):**  You can come unannounced but if you give us some ahead of time notice, maybe myself or  
**[0:55:31-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:31):**  some of the others will be there to meet with you, tour the site, get to know the farmers,  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:37):**  connect with our community.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:38):**  We would love to have you there.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:40):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:41):**  Hey, well Eric, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:44):**  It's been a real pleasure talking to you.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:46):**  I hope we can reconnect in the future real soon.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:48):**  I'd love that.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:49):**  Thank you so much, Oliver.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:50):**  All right.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:51):**  Take care.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:52):**  You too.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:53):**  So, before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:55:57-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:55:57):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad  
**[0:56:02-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:02):**  Goodsy.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:03):**  Hey buddy, what's new?  
**[0:56:04-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:04):**  Oh man, so much is happening.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:06):**  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:09):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:56:13-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:13):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:15):**  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:20):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:22):**  As you know, we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:26):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:30):**  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:56:35-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:35):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:56:41-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:41):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:42):**  Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:48):**  Yeah, that's for sure.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:49):**  It's changing, but like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:56:55):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one  
**[0:57:00-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:00):**  of our intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:02):**  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I  
**[0:57:08-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:08):**  know of available anywhere.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:11):**  Basically with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything  
**[0:57:15-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:15):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:21):**  That's what I'm excited about man.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:22):**  But yeah, what about you?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:24):**  What's going on?  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:25):**  Man, well you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:57:29-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:29):**  season as well.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:30):**  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:57:35-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:35):**  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:38):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:57:43-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:43):**  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:47):**  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:57:52-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:52):**  methods for years and years to come.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:54):**  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:57:58):**  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:03):**  Heck yeah!  
**[0:58:04-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:04):**  That sounds amazing man.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:06):**  And honestly, this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things  
**[0:58:10-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:10):**  too.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:11):**  This little town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala, like right  
**[0:58:15-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:15):**  here on the shores of Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:17):**  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:20):**  On top of that, you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich  
**[0:58:24-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:24):**  and alive.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:25):**  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:31):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:36):**  I mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going  
**[0:58:40-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:40):**  on.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:41):**  We've got the projects that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat  
**[0:58:44-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:44):**  centers, you have Charlie Rendell's Natural Bamboo Building School, you have Love Probiotics,  
**[0:58:50-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:50):**  you have Fungi Academy, and honestly loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:56):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:58:58):**  Yeah man, it really does.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:00):**  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make  
**[0:59:04-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:04):**  sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:06):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:59:07-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:07):**  Give us a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:10):**  I mean, all food and lodging in the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:14):**  the tuition, so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:18):**  That's a great idea.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:19):**  Because I mean people can still take just one course if that's what they're into or  
**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:23):**  if they can't make the full two weeks, but this will actually make the two courses more  
**[0:59:27-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:27):**  accessible to even a wider audience of people.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:30):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[0:59:34-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:34):**  want to do.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen/#t=0:59:36):**  So hey, to all of you listening out there, we really want passionate and driven people

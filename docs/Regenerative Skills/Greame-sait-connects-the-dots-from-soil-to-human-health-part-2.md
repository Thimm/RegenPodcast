**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:15):**  I can't wait to see you there!  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:20):**  Welcome back everybody, today we'll be picking up where we left off last week in our 3-part  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:24):**  series with Graham Sait. For a long time, I've been working to connect the pieces between  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:29):**  ecological health, regenerative methods of farming, and the health of the human body.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:34):**  Though many of you will find the connection between those three elements very intuitive,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:37):**  I've worked to find experts and practitioners who've illuminated some essential pieces of  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:42):**  that puzzle over time. Up until now, most of the discussions on this show have focused  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:47):**  on just one of those elements at a time, but today we'll continue with the second of the  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:51):**  3-part series with Graham Sait, who has made it his life's work to marry these disciplines  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:02:56):**  and train farmers, healthcare professionals, and ecologists around the world in the importance  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:00):**  of caring for our bodies and our ecologies as a single organism that requires all of  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:05):**  the pieces to be in place for optimal function.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:08):**  If you didn't have the chance to hear the first part, I highly recommend it to give  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:12):**  context to this episode, and I've linked it in the show notes. So for a quick recap, Graham  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:16):**  Sait is the internationally acclaimed author and educator who co-founded NutriTech Solutions  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:21):**  and Nutrition Matters, as well as hosting the Nutrition Farming Podcast. He has written  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:26):**  hundreds of published articles and the popular book Nutrition Rules. Graham has formulated  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:31):**  many of the soil health and human health products for which NTS are renowned, and he has developed  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:36):**  all of the nutrition programs that are the keystone for their proactive management approach.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:41):**  Graham also owns Nutrition Farm, which comprises of two distinctly different properties dedicated  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:46):**  to the production of nutrient-dense, chemical-free food with forgotten flavors and enhanced medicinal  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:51):**  qualities. Now because our conversation turned into a marathon of learning, I decided to  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:03:56):**  release it in three parts, which will make it easier to process and to find parts which  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:00):**  to go back to in order to review some of the information later.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:05):**  So here in this second session, Graham and I will explore valuable in-field monitoring  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:09):**  tools, the connection between the health of the soil and the health of the human body,  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:14):**  and how tracing back common deficiencies in our own bodies has the potential to be remedied  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:18):**  by recovering the nutrients that have been lost in our plants, which are grown in depleted  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:23):**  or microbially inactive soils.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:26):**  Graham has an incredible wealth of knowledge, and you'll quickly see why I chose to break  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:29):**  this interview into parts, because every snippet contains enough information for a show by  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:34):**  itself. With that said, I'll hand things over now to Graham.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:40):**  As we're making these parallels between health in the soil and health in our own bodies,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:45):**  what are some of the tests that you go to to determine the holistic health of a human  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:51):**  that can give you the types of insights into what is going on, the synthesis of various  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:04:57):**  nutrients and the uptake of the essential things that keep us functioning properly?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:02):**  Well, I'll just move into that in a moment, but I'll just quickly talk about a couple  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:07):**  of things. One of the meters that I consider to be most important in terms of infield monitoring  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:11):**  tools is a very simple thing called potassium meter. Now I call potassium the money mineral  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:16):**  because it is, it determines the size of things and that's what you get paid for. It also  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:20):**  determines the sweetness in many instances, but because it carries sugars into the developing  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:25):**  fruit or seed or whatever. And so the problem with potassium is that it's the most mobile  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:31):**  of all minerals, second most abundant mineral behind nitrogen, but most mobile, more mobile  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:35):**  even than nitrogen, which is pretty mobile. And so when you start running out of potassium,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:39):**  and if you're monitoring the crop using a conventional leaf test, you're measuring the  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:44):**  first fully developed leaf at the top of the plant. But the reality is because of its mobility,  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:49):**  the moment you start running out of potassium, the plant draws its reserves from the lower  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:53):**  leaves and you're not measuring those leaves. And by the time the entire plant's drained  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:05:57):**  and you finally measure, oh, I'm short of potassium, you've been short of potassium  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:01):**  for weeks and you'll never catch up. You're going to lose yield. And so what a potassium  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:06):**  meter does, squeeze a few drops of the leaf into this only three drops as required. So  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:11):**  it's got a little sink and it can collect those three drops and you measure potassium  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:15):**  levels and parts per million at the top and then the first fully developed leaf. And then  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:19):**  you go to a lower leaf, not one that's senesce, not one that's dying off, but a healthy lower  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:23):**  leaf. And they've got to be the same. Basically they need to be exactly the same reading or  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:28):**  close to the same. And as the lower leaf becomes 10% lower than the top leaf and this whole  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:33):**  test literally do the two a minute. But as soon as that bottom, that's your monitoring  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:40):**  tool and you wouldn't believe if you're monitoring just what happens after flowering, you can  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:43):**  be ticking along at 2,500 parts per million of potassium on a meter, the crop flowers  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:48):**  five days later at 900 parts per million, there's so much potential required and no  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:51):**  one realizes that. And very commonly, particularly in a cereal cropping and so forth, you actually  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:06:57):**  run it. And then if it gets dry, potassium is only taken from the soil solution. It's  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:02):**  not fixed into the leaf like nitrogen can be through nitrogen fixes living on the leaf.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:06):**  You know, for an abundant, you need a lot of it. You only get it from soil solution.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:10):**  And if there's no soil solution because of dry conditions and you don't have irrigation,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:14):**  then the first thing that happens is you get a burnt edge on the lower leaves because that's  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:18):**  the side of potassium rushing from the bottom to the top and the burnt leaf on the other  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:22):**  edge. There's this classic something. You see that on crops in Australia all the time,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:25):**  dry land crops, and then you follow spray potassium to compensate for that. But the  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:30):**  meter allows you and gives you fingertip control basically of the money mineral. And it can  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:36):**  be a game changer in terms of your profitability. So there's also things like nitrogen meters,  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:41):**  which you can make sure the idea with nitrogen is that, you know, it's been used and abused  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:47):**  more than any other mineral because it does give such a response and we tend to overdo  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:51):**  it. And if we overdo nitrogen, which is hugely common and intensive horticulture, and this,  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:07:56):**  what the price we pay for that is the first thing that it impacts is that it shuts down  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:00):**  potassium. So now you need more potassium, which is even more expensive, much more expensive  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:04):**  than nitrogen, but then it also shuts down calcium. And then it shuts down boron. Now,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:08):**  if you look at the wonderful book called plant nutrition and disease, the summary of research,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:13):**  mineral, sorry, mineral nutrition diseases, what it looks like, always have it sitting  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:17):**  on my desk. And you look at the principal link between minerals and disease. Nitrogen  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:24):**  is number one, mismanagement, too much, too little, the wrong form at the wrong time is  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:28):**  number one source of multiple diseases. Number two is potassium, particularly low potassium.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:34):**  Number three is calcium and number five is boron. So by mismanaging one mineral, you  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:38):**  just shot yourself on the foot three other times and started on your knees. So it's,  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:44):**  you know, that's what I mean. It's just understanding the dynamics of these things. It's got a nitrogen  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:49):**  meter allows you to say, what's my sweet spot because every plant, every crop in different  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:53):**  soil conditions, different climatic conditions, different biological conditions will have  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:08:59):**  its sweet spot for nitrogen. If you're using these meters in sync with each other, and  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:03):**  even sometimes in parallel with leaf and conventional leaf analysis, you say, okay, this is where  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:08):**  our crops, the crops, the healthiest is when my Brix levels bestest, when my sat pH is  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:13):**  right in the nitrogen, that 1400 parts per million, that's where I want to be. That's  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:17):**  my sweet spot during the vegetative period. It's going to be much lower from flowering  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:22):**  on, which when potassium takes over as the driver from flowering onwards and nitrogen  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:25):**  pulls right back and you just learn where your sweet spot at those two times of the  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:29):**  season is. And that changes things very quickly. So back to the human health side, I mean,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:36):**  obviously there are some very, very valuable tests now that can measure and it's really  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:42):**  and people think, oh, yeah, I've got, I've got, I've got Bifidus down below and I've  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:46):**  got acidophilus up at the top and it's so much more complex than that. I mean, there's  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:49):**  just a vast array of organisms and there are these screens now they're called bio screens.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:09:55):**  You've got to get a poo test and within 24 hours for it to be valid. So you need to be  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:00):**  in a city or have a courier that can get it there on that time. But they give you this  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:04):**  analysis like a soil food web analysis or a DNA analysis. And you'll see these overgrowths  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:10):**  and undersplied things. And then they can actually tweak that usually with specific  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:14):**  little antibiotics that will take out one overgrowth. And then they'll give you specific  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:20):**  things like E. coli. You think who would take E. coli? Well, quite often people come back  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:23):**  that don't have enough E. coli and they've got to actually take some E. coli to balance  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:26):**  up that system. And that can be a game changer in terms of degenerative, particularly inflammatory  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:31):**  diseases. But the other kind of things, I mean, we've got an agriculture system that's  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:36):**  just basically 60 to 65% of the chemicals we use in endocrine disruptors. I've got endocrinologist  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:43):**  friends who tell me that there's no one over 40 who's ever come in their door who's not  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:48):**  messed up from a hormone balance perspective. And that's huge and everything. Even if you  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:10:53):**  look at something like, and you know, there's this thing. So there's a whole range of other  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:00):**  players. If we look at the world's most widely prescribed drug, for example, and the world's  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:05):**  most widely prescribed drug are the lipid lowering drugs. There are nine of them, counting  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:09):**  for $23 billion in sales. So there's the world's most widely used drug. And the mode of action  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:15):**  of those lipid lowering drugs is the classic kind of silly idea of symptom treating with  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:21):**  chemicals in a sense, because the mode of action is to shut down a building block called  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:25):**  Mavilinate. Now Mavilinate is also the building block for Coenzyme Q10. So you're taking this  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:30):**  stuff because you're theoretically trying to protect your heart because the cholesterol  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:34):**  is being pointed as pointed out as this poison, which is not it's a hugely important substance.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:39):**  But to shut it down, you shut down the building block of the building block governs the building  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:42):**  of Coenzyme Q10, which we decline in from 30 onwards, Coenzyme Q10 by some countries  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:49):**  like Japan, it's the most important single nutrient for the heart. It's required for  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:53):**  in the mitochondria. And so cells are going to go boom, boom for every second for every  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:11:58):**  hour of your life. They're going to have a lot of energy and Coenzyme Q10 is a huge player  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:03):**  in that energising cells and brain cells that think 50,000 thoughts a day similarly need  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:09):**  to be highly energised. And so Coenzyme is accumulated in the heart and the brain accordingly,  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:13):**  you just shut it down with something theoretically to protect your heart. But more importantly,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:18):**  in that context is that if we look at the role, we get back and say, Okay, what does  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:23):**  cholesterol do? We've called it a poison. What does it do? Cholesterol is the very top  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:29):**  of what's called the hormone cascade, it's the building block for our sex hormones. And  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:33):**  what we see and you'll see, you talk to people who have been a year on lipids, low on cholesterol  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:38):**  and drugs, and there's many, many hundreds of thousands of them, they lose their libido,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:42):**  they've got no sex drive, women and men. So women need half the testosterone that men  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:47):**  need, but they still need testosterone. And it's one of the largest players in what I  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:52):**  call the death of desire, the absolute loss of libido in a woman, it's a play where women  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:12:57):**  have just lost. And that's huge, because libido is a direct measure of your overall health,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:04):**  you should be horny until the day you die, is what the message is. And interesting with  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:09):**  the study that's just come out, looking at every parameter of your health, what they  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:13):**  found was that people who had sex most were the happiest, strangely. And at the moment,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:17):**  we're not doing that. So many of us are impacted with environmental impacts on our hormonal  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:22):**  balance and testosterone is huge in that story. And as progesterone, you know, this is an  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:29):**  amazing balance between estrogen and progesterone and all of the negatives that estrogen does,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:35):**  particularly when you get to the place of the situation like menopause or andropause,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:39):**  the equivalent of men. But all of the negatives that estrogen can do, which of course, feeding  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:44):**  breast cancer and prostate cancer are countered by this little, it's just like this perfect  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:48):**  balance, everything, there's 20 things, bad things that estrogen does, and 20 things that  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:52):**  are directly countered by progesterone. It's this wonderful example of the importance of  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:13:57):**  balance, which is the most important thing in everything basically. But anyway, it's  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:14:01):**  just digressing.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:14:05):**  It does often come down to that, that finding balance is essential and that needs to be  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:14:11):**  calculated within the context in which people are, right? The diet that's available to them,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:14:16):**  the conditions that they're under, the stress levels in their lives, so many factors, but  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:14:21):**  within that finding a balance within what is available. At this point, we've got to  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:14:26):**  start to figure out how we can start to take steps to reverse this process of loss of nutrition  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:14:32):**  and biology in our soils, as well as in our gut microbiomes. What have you seen as some  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:14:37):**  of the largest propellants in either getting people to realize that there's a problem and

**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:15:13):**  And farmers are notoriously unhealthy, unfortunately. And of course, a huge player in that is just

**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:15:32):**  to sort of teach strategies to try to make it more fun and to make it more profitable,

**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:15:40):**  of stress, again, we've got to look at, first of all, the mineral side, and what what you  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:15:46):**  one of the things, first things you address in that scenario, and then we'll start to

**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:15:55):**  things that are most impacted by stress, because number one is magnesium, it's the largest

**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:16:55):**  presumably that on you're not on morphine or something that's not not the hell out of  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:16:59):**  your reasoning capacity. But usually there's a kind of clarity that comes through where  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:03):**  you see your life and you can evaluate it. And what you realize is that what you were  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:07):**  the most important thing in life was how much peace and happiness to do secure or achieve  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:12):**  in that short lifetime. Well, the opposite of peace and happiness is stress and anxiety.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:16):**  And that's what we're living in. So we sort of messed up, you know, as a society, we kind  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:21):**  of really fucked up badly. And we need to do something. We need to do a whole range  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:26):**  of things, which I teach in the courses in terms of how we can change that. And the first  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:30):**  of those is to address magnesium. And that's just an accident salts bath 40 minutes with  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:33):**  two cups of action salts a couple of times a week until you build your numbers up because  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:37):**  it's far more effective to absorb magnesium transdermally through the skin because the  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:43):**  side effect of the prolonged or chronic magnesium deficiency, which many of us have been in  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:49):**  that situation or are in that situation is that you got can no longer absorb magnesium  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:53):**  through the gut lining anywhere near as efficiently. So you can't even fix it through your gut.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:17:57):**  You can do it with injections. You can do it intravenously where you can do it transdermally,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:01):**  which is just an absence salts bath. And it's as good as any. And, and, and, and you can  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:07):**  only do it at night because you're so cruisy and so relaxed and not better that bath. Then  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:11):**  you understand that's what magnesium does. And the downside of you don't do it, you get  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:16):**  more stress, just that more magnesium, more stress, more magnesium, and to have a stroke  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:19):**  or heart attack as the usual end outcome, which is the number one and three kilo number  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:25):**  one and number four killers. So so, so that's one thing magnesium number two is B6, vitamin  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:32):**  B6 is the stress vitamin. So you've got to supplement almost everyone needs to be supplementing  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:36):**  or having that bath and supplementing with B6. And then they got no little tricks. If  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:40):**  you're taking a hundred milligrams, which is the dose you need to take a B6, then you've  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:44):**  got to take a B complex with it because the B vitamins don't work by themselves very well.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:49):**  They've got to have that constant. You never find one B vitamin of food. It's always the  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:53):**  whole sweet because they're all cofactors for the uptake of each of them. They've got  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:18:57):**  to have the full chorus, the whole choir there for them to work correctly. And so it's all  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:03):**  those kind of simple tricks that I sort of talk about from that perspective. But when  
**[0:19:06-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:06):**  we talk about we go back to how can we reclaim soil health and so forth? It's the capacity  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:15):**  to monitor the study, but where's my study point? Where's my, what is my microbial biomass  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:20):**  count? Because if I can improve it, I'm going to do better. What works to improve in a simple  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:24):**  little tool allows you to monitor what works best. If I'm buying a compost is a good compost  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:29):**  because many of them aren't. There are many, many, many substantive compost. It's simply  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:33):**  didn't because people were anxious to turn it over and get some money. They didn't finish  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:38):**  the composting process. That's so common in the commercial composting world, but now you've  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:42):**  got a little tool you can measure and you can measure the count and see if it's worth  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:45):**  using it on and so forth. Even microbial and optimums, you can measure them. Are they good  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:50):**  or are they junk? Because otherwise you don't know, you've even got a clue. So that's a  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:19:55):**  wonderful little tool. And so then it becomes how do we build soil life and improve that  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:01):**  fungal to bacteria ratio? And one of the biggest kind of changes currently has been the recognition  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:06):**  of what's called a cocktail cover crop and its impact on soil life. So this is just the,  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:13):**  if we sat with the definition of the word science in which the sectionary is adherence  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:17):**  to natural laws and principles. We have a perfect blueprint we're supposed to learn  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:21):**  from it and what we do, so we can do better than that, or we can't, we're on our knees  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:24):**  staring down the abyss because of that arrogance that we were supposed to learn from this perfect  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:29):**  blueprint. And if we say in that context, okay, let's learn from nature, what's the  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:34):**  central principle of nature? It's quite simple. It's biodiversity. So if biodiversity is the  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:39):**  central principle of nature and science is working with nature rather than against it,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:44):**  then monoculture is a ridiculous joke that we went into some of this counter, everything  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:49):**  that we're supposed to be doing, you select your feet, every place. The thing to understand  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:52):**  is this, plants don't just exude 30% of their glucose. They lace that glucose exudate with  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:20:59):**  nutrients that will sponsor the delivery of the minerals. Say I grow bananas on one of  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:04):**  my farms here, the subtropical farm, amongst many things I grow bananas, but bananas have  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:08):**  got a very, very high need for manganese as have several other crops. And so they will  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:13):**  lace that exudate, that glucose exudate with specific foods that will feed manganese reducing  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:18):**  organisms to deliver the mineral they want. So every plant is doing that. And basically  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:24):**  the more plants you've got above ground, the more diversity above ground, the more diversity  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:28):**  you've got below ground. So while we can't say we have a tear at the orchard because  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:32):**  it's a monoculture, what we can say is let's put a monoculture cover crop in the interrow  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:36):**  and some of that to counter that mistake of a monoculture. And that's what people are  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:42):**  doing with great success. And the findings are quite profound. There's a Brazilian scientist  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:48):**  Dr. Adamia Caligari, who's made this discovery and I personally think it's possibly kind  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:53):**  of Nobel prize winning stuff, but he's discovered that if you can have 5 families and what's  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:21:57):**  called a multi species cover crop or a cocktail cover crop, and those 5 families are grasses,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:03):**  cereals, brassicas, legumes, and that's very common to have grasses, cereals, brassicas,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:07):**  legumes in one blend, but the one that's not common and needs to be in there is called,  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:12):**  looks like it should be pronounced chenopods, but it's actually pronounced chenopods, c-h-e-n-o-pods.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:19):**  Small group of plants concludes everything from the beet family, should have been silverbeet,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:24):**  beetroot, spinach, quinoa, and amaranth. That's all, it's a very small group, but you only  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:29):**  need 1% of that seed in your blend. Usually about 5, 6% brassicas is the other one you  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:34):**  pull back on and then you can make your choice whether it's going to be legume dominated  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:38):**  or cereal dominated or whatever for the rest of it. But we're not talking just 5, we're  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:42):**  saying the best thing is to have like 20, 4 of each or whatever, but you only need 1  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:47):**  chenopod in there and you only need 1%, but without it, the magical thing, it's not magical,  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:53):**  it's actually science behind it now. So there's a friend of mine, Ron Nickles, who used to  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:22:56):**  head the soil health division of the USAG department, and he said, okay, let's have a look at some  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:01):**  of these guys who are doing this and saying, look, I'm getting the responsible 4 cover  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:04):**  crops in one 4 month cover cropping cycle, my soil structure changed, I could push a  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:08):**  pentatrometer to the end when it would clonk at a hard pan for 4 months before, and I've  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:14):**  never seen these changes with one single input. And so they said, okay, what's happening here?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:19):**  And what they discovered was, the USDA scientists, that only when the 5 families are present,  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:25):**  4 of them doesn't do it, the plant roots then, when the 5 families are there, they begin  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:30):**  this pumping out of phenolic compounds, all of the roots from all 5 species start pumping,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:35):**  they message each other and they start pumping out these phenolic compounds. And so now,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:39):**  they are the most powerful phenolic compounds, actually the most powerful of antioxidants.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:44):**  And so that's why we drink green tea, and that's why we have dark chops, and that's  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:47):**  why we eat blueberries, and they're all similar groups of phenolic compounds. And it turns  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:52):**  out that just like those phenol, those massively powerful antioxidants affect every one of  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:23:56):**  our 10-trim cells beneficially, it's the same thing, perhaps the single and multistep  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:01):**  creatures in the soil, they literally go into hyperdrive in the presence of that phenolic  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:06):**  outpouring, and that's why cocktail cover crops are this huge phenomenon globally, and  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:11):**  you can measure that change with a microbiome meter and say, oh my god, there's nothing  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:14):**  that changed my soil so quickly as this simple cocktail cover crop. So whether you do that  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:20):**  between roads in an orchard, whether you do that with direct drilling into pastures and  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:24):**  bring that diversity into a pasture scenario and graze it off with the animals, and of  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:28):**  course, there's the whole concept of how you graze and what I call intelligent grazing  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:32):**  and how you can use the animals as a principle fertility tool if you graze them correctly,  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:38):**  and so forth. That's a whole other story. But so, cocktail cover crops is huge, humic  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:43):**  and phobic acid. So when you're composting, two of the very important substances that  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:48):**  have been produced during composting, and you can analyze the compost and the quality  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:52):**  of the compost is partially determined by how much of these two natural acids you created.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:24:58):**  Humus itself contains those two very, very active natural acids, but you can extract  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:03):**  them from certain forms of brown coal in a very concentrated form, and they've become  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:08):**  huge, huge players in regenerative agriculture. Humic acid is predominantly a fungal stimulant,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:14):**  it's filled with long chain carbohydrates, and it's not just a fungal stimulant, it's  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:17):**  the most powerful known fungal stimulant. So if you're trying to improve that fungal  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:22):**  to bacteria ratio, humic acid has a huge play, it has a huge role to play. Phobic acid is  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:29):**  predominantly a bacterial stimulant, it's 10 times smaller molecularly than humic acid,  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:34):**  but it is a wonderful collating agent and you can add phobic acid to anything. If you're  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:38):**  conventional and not organic, you can take something like calcium, say you're trying  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:43):**  to play the calcium game and understanding the importance of calcium, almost every crop  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:48):**  requires foliar calcium. And the cheap way to do that, you can't do it if you're organic,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:51):**  but if you're regenerative, you can. This calcium nitrate is just a couple of kilos  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:25:55):**  per hectare and phobic acid to create a calcium folate. And we've done all the work to show  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:00):**  there's one, there are a few things, but much more expensive things that can can deliver  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:04):**  more effectively than that, but it's very, very good at a very, very low price. You do  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:09):**  it yourself. It's five bucks a hectare, that kind of cost. So and this is dollars, not  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:15):**  euros. So it can be very, very, very cost effective, that strategy. And so, yeah, that's  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:21):**  that's so you start looking at the tools that you can bring in to change that scenario.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:25):**  Now there's a wonderful new substance that is a byproduct of the manufacturer of biochar.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:32):**  So when you when you make biochar, are you familiar with biochar? You know what that  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:35):**  is. So when you make biochar, it's called pyrolysis, it's in an enclosed container and  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:40):**  the condensation can be collected. You have a whole system where you collect it and they  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:44):**  call that condensation wood vinegar. And it contains all of the compounds that have been  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:49):**  found in the smoke smells incredibly powerfully of smoke. You put it on your hand, you smell  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:53):**  like you've burnt off someone. You've got, you've got to be, oh you've been burning off  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:26:56):**  yet. You can't actually get the smell off your hand, but the compounds in there are  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:00):**  quite similar in some ways, lots of vanilla compounds and a whole range of other substances  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:05):**  that are similar to what's in phobic acid. But it has a bit of an insecticidal effect.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:09):**  I don't know if they don't know the smell, I don't know what it is, but it's quite, it's  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:12):**  a nematicide, really quite a good nematicide. It's fungicidal, but it's a wonderful tool  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:18):**  to improve microbial biomass at quite low rates, 10 litres per hectare. They can boost  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:24):**  dramatically. You can take a solid 300 microbio meter and take it to 1000 from one application.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:29):**  I'm talking serious, like I haven't seen anything that does that that quickly, but not just  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:34):**  that. You can take a 90 to 90, 10 funda bacteria ratio up to 50 50 and one to two applications.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:40):**  So there's lots of new things that are coming into the, into play with tremendous potential  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:46):**  in terms of that, bringing back their biology. So that's the biological side, the most important  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:50):**  ratio, mineral ratio on the soil. And this, these are all the things of course determine  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:54):**  quality and determine shelf life and nutrition, nutrient density and medicinal value of food  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:27:58):**  and so forth. But the most important ratio before you do anything else is to fix the  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:03):**  calcium to magnesium ratio. And that's because the most important single element is not in  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:08):**  P K it's not even calcium. The most important single element by far is oxygen. I mean, we  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:14):**  last for two minutes if you hold your nose and it's the most important for all carbon  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:18):**  based life forms. Oxygen is the most important substance. So one of the chief roles that  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:23):**  you're involved in when you're growing things is you're managing something called gas exchange.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:27):**  How freely does oxygen diffuse, which means it's a law that things come from high concentration  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:32):**  or low concentration. I can't help themselves. Gases do that. They diffuse. So oxygen diffuses  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:37):**  them. So if your soil is rival and open enough to allow it, and of course the roots use oxygen  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:41):**  for everything, the organisms crowd around that root waiting for their daily feed, use  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:45):**  oxygen. They utilize that oxygen, the more the better. And then they breathe out and  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:28:50):**  of course they breathe out CO2. So now that gas diffuses from the soil and the plants

**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:03):**  gas exchange. How free does oxygen come out freely to CO2 diffuse from that soil to drive  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:10):**  photosynthesis and drive your whole productive potential. And that's gas exchange and what  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:15):**  determines gas exchange from a biological perspective is that fungi bacteria thing because  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:21):**  bacteria create a tiny little aggregate with their sticky exudates and fungi wrap that  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:26):**  into a much larger crumb, a larger aggregate and crumb structure is largely a biological  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:31):**  thing. So that's a great way to get that soil breathing when you've got all these spaces  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:35):**  between the crumbs breathing in and out for that matter. But from a mineral perspective  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:41):**  and the physical change comes about through the calcium to magnesium ratio. So calcium  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:46):**  double positively charged cation. So it's like a beach ball. Every mineral has a different  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:51):**  ionic radius, has a different size. Calcium is a great mineral, has a positive charge  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:29:56):**  on each side. It grabs a little colloid of clay on either side and pushes apart the clay  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:00):**  and that's called flocculation. That's calcium's huge physical roles in the soil and now your  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:06):**  soil breathes better. Magnesium is also double positively charged but it's a golf ball compared  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:12):**  to that beach ball and so it pulls the clay, grabs clay on either side, pulls it in and  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:17):**  now you've got platform shoes in the wet. You've got a closed tight soil that doesn't  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:20):**  breathe very well, that doesn't have the oxygen and a whole range of problems happen including  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:26):**  sometimes the dominance of anaerobes that are very, very negative that don't need oxygen.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:31):**  So they consrive because they haven't got the oxygen levels keeping them in check and  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:36):**  you get diseases and so forth associated with that poor breathing capacity of soil. So first  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:40):**  thing you're going to do is get your soil breathing and to do that it's fungal to bacteria  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:43):**  ratio and the calmic ratio. So those are all the same kind of things that we, and then  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:48):**  you've got to look at the roles of all the trace minerals and you've got to make sure  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:50):**  that you are addressing those trace minerals, understand their roles. You don't want, your  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:55):**  second role is that you're managing chlorophyll and you don't want pale colours and blotches  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:30:59):**  and stripes on that leaf. You want chlorophyll density as maximum and of course the refractometer  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:04):**  helps you measure that. And so now you're looking at all these little trace minerals  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:08):**  and little obscure things sometimes that we've completely ignored. Minerals like molybdenum  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:13):**  for example. So molybdenum is only required at 0.5 of a part per million and this is a  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:19):**  tiny amount, but 80% of the soils that we would look at in the 57 countries we work  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:24):**  in are lacking in molybdenum. And that's huge because for one thing, the concept of nitrogen  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:31):**  fixation is from microorganisms is hugely important because in terms of nitrogen, there's  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:37):**  a nitrate in the ammonium form of nitrogen and basically there's a balance between those  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:42):**  in the plant and the leaf and the soil. It's a one to one ratio ideally, although they  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:46):**  fluctuate constantly because ammonia gets nitrified and so forth. But the idea is to  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:52):**  have no more than 20 parts per million of either ammonium and nitrate nitrogen, but  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:31:57):**  in the plant it's actually three parts ammonium to one part nitrate. So to achieve that you  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:03):**  will never achieve, and that's a resilience ratio. If you can get anywhere near that,  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:07):**  you've got a much more resilient crop, but you will never get anywhere near that unless  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:11):**  you've got the tools in place to fix nitrogen successfully from the atmosphere. Recognise  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:17):**  and there was 74,000 tonnes of nitrogen gas hovering above every hectare and you were  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:22):**  supposed to be getting a significant percentage of your nitrogen in the ammonium form through  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:27):**  the conversion of that gas to the ammonium form of nitrogen. Now that involves an enzyme  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:31):**  that both free living nitrogen fixes and the organisms on the roots utilise called nitrogenase  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:37):**  and that's made from molybdenum. If you are one of the 80% that don't have molybdenum,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:41):**  we're going to be eating nitrate packed carcinogenic food, because that's what nitrates are. There's  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:46):**  200 published papers linking them to nitrates because we can convert them to protein, which  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:50):**  drives plant immunity, animal immunity and human immunity all for the sake of a cup full  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:32:57):**  of sodium molybdate because we have a test for it. So you start to see the importance  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:00):**  of these less, what we thought of as less significant things. And then we see, you know,  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:05):**  we're using urea, the biggest, most widely used form of nitrogen. It usually enters the  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:10):**  plant, goes through from beginning, life is the amine form of nitrogen. Very quickly the  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:14):**  urea enzyme converts it through to the ammonium form of nitrogen. Then if there's moisture  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:22):**  and warmth, which is when you use urea, so there usually is, then nitrocline bacteria  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:26):**  come and convert most of it very quickly to the nitrate form and most of the urea goes  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:30):**  into the plant. Now sitting in the leaf bottom with a lot of water with a dilution factor  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:34):**  involved, which means you have more insect pressure often, but you don't want it sitting  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:38):**  there as a nitrate. You want that converted to a protein and that involves a second enzyme.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:44):**  And that enzyme is called the nitrate reductase enzyme that converts nitrates through to protein,  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:49):**  which drives plant immunity and human immunity. And that enzyme, the nitrate reductase enzyme  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:54):**  is made from a lip to them that I did a team. People don't have in their soul. So you just  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:33:58):**  have to say, if you get back to root cause, it's how you solve things. This is how you  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:34:01):**  do it. You've got to take care of all of that. You've got to get all your ducks on the line  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:34:05):**  and take care of those things. And that's what nutrition farming is basically.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:34:09):**  All right, I'll stop things there for this session and pick up again next week when Graham  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:34:14):**  and I will wrap up the interview by talking about all the unique benefits of worm castings  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:34:19):**  in the soil and all the nutrition that they're able to cycle in the system. We also discuss  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:34:24):**  how and why humic substance content in the soil is directly related to the profitability

**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-2/#t=0:34:39):**  these connections and explaining them in a linear and digestible way. I really hope that

**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:23):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:26):**  Have you ever felt completely bogged down by the weight of current events and news?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:30):**  Things like climate change, government corruption, war and violence seem to be the norm and hard  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:34):**  to get away from.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:35):**  I know these things affect me deeply and that's why I'm always looking for positive news  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:40):**  and media about solutions and inspiring change.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:44):**  That's why I'm proud to say that I've partnered with one of my favorite sources for just those  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:47):**  things.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:48):**  New Society Publishers are book publishers that focus on putting out great books and  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:52):**  positive solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their lives so that they  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:01:57):**  can go on to change the world for the better.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:00):**  And what's more, their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:05):**  They actually care deeply, not only about what they publish but also about how they  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:09):**  do business.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:10):**  They believe in the authors they take on and the works they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:15):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers have the books you  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:19):**  need to help build a better world.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:21):**  In fact, the author that I'm interviewing today, Curtis Stone, and his book The Urban  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:25):**  Farmer are published by them and if you stay tuned at the end of this interview, I'll  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:30):**  tell you how you can be eligible to win your own copy of The Urban Farmer.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:34):**  So stick around for that after the interview.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:36):**  My guest today is none other than Curtis Stone, author of The Urban Farmer.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:41):**  For the better part of a decade, Curtis has been pushing the boundaries of organic gardening  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:45):**  in the city and proving through his carefully documented processes that making a profit  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:50):**  on small acreage and borrowed land is realistic.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:53):**  He's also the host of a fantastic YouTube channel which is practically an ongoing master  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:02:58):**  level course for aspiring urban farmers and small scale market gardeners.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:03):**  In this interview, Curtis shares his incredible formulas for farming on land that you don't  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:07):**  own and how to select plants that will give you a maximum profit in a small space.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:12):**  He also goes into some of the most common mistakes that city farmers make and gives  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:16):**  great advice on the first steps you should take to starting a profitable farm in an urban  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:21):**  setting.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:22):**  This is another densely packed episode full of actionable information, so grab yourself  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:27):**  a notebook and I'll turn things over to Curtis.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:29):**  Hey Curtis, how are you doing today?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:31):**  Thanks for being on the show.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:32):**  Yeah, happy to be here.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:34):**  So before we jump into all the questions here, do you think you could tell us a little bit  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:37):**  about your background and how you got started in urban farming?  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:42):**  Well my background is in music actually.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:45):**  I was, for all of my 20s I was pursuing a career in music composition and I was playing  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:54):**  in bands and trying to make a career out of being a music composer for film.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:01):**  And that kind of got tired of that in the sense that I just got tired of living in a  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:07):**  city and doing that grind.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:10):**  And I've always been interested in living off the grid and homesteading and kind of  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:15):**  everything green.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:17):**  And in 2008 as the recession was hitting I really thought the world was going to shit  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:24):**  at that point.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:25):**  And I was like, I sort of mapped out a five-year plan at that time and wanted to start taking  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:32):**  radical steps to working towards self-reliance in some way.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:37):**  And so I left the city of Montreal and moved back out west which I was originally from.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:43):**  And I went on a bike tour down the west coast visiting eco villages and off-grid homesteads  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:49):**  and organic farms just to kind of see what people were doing and what was possible.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:54):**  And I got really inspired by things that I saw.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:56):**  I didn't really learn much about that stuff on that tour but I just more or less learned  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:00):**  a lot about myself and how incredibly powerful we can be as human beings once we put our  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:06):**  minds to something.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:07):**  And so I was more inspired on that trip and I came back to after that trip came back to  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:14):**  BC and just wanted to start taking steps towards farming somehow.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:19):**  And I kept running into this problem of how do you farm if you can't afford to buy land.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:26):**  And land is really expensive where I live.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:28):**  And so I wasn't really in a position where I could even get a mortgage to buy land because  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:34):**  an acre of land can cost like a million dollars out here.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:37):**  At least in the part that I live in British Columbia and this is the part that I wanted  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:40):**  to be in.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:41):**  And so I just I heard about these urban farmers doing farming on people's yards.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:47):**  I heard about two people in particular and I was inspired by what they were doing and  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:51):**  I got to know them.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:53):**  I phoned them and I reached out and they gave me a lot of good advice and I just kind of  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:59):**  went for it.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:01):**  And I made a living at it right away.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:03):**  Like in my first year I was making a living at it.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:05):**  Not a great living but good enough that I could pay for my living expenses and also  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:12):**  have enough startup capital to go into the next season and then continue to grow the  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:17):**  business.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:18):**  So I did that and I grew the business for about four years.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:21):**  I doubled it every year.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:22):**  So it got really good.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:23):**  It got really big and then it got a little too big for what I wanted and I started to  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:28):**  scale back and I discovered in that process that kind of doubling down on the things that  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:33):**  are working and eliminating the things that aren't was a really good business model.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:37):**  And so that's kind of where we are today.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:39):**  Like I've been doing this for eight years now.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:41):**  But I really figured out how kind of following the Pareto Principle, the rule of 80-20 has  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:46):**  been sort of my recipe for success in all of this.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:51):**  Now that's a really remarkable story.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:54):**  And like you were talking about earlier, one of the unique things that you've learned how  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:57):**  to do is to farm in an urban setting on borrowed or leased land.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:01):**  Could you go into a little more detail about how you started doing that?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:06):**  So I mean I wanted to farm somewhere.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:08):**  I knew that I wasn't going to buy land.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:10):**  I was looking at like leasing land or renting land in some way.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:15):**  And a good friend of mine told me that he had in his family had this urban lot downtown  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:25):**  that was pretty ideal because it had like had about 6,000 square feet of growing area  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:29):**  in it.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:30):**  It was right downtown.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:31):**  And so they offered it to me and they said look if you act as sort of a caretaker of  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:35):**  this land because they had a rental house on it.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:39):**  And they were paying somebody to come and do the lawn maintenance and all that kind  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:43):**  of stuff.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:44):**  They said look if you do all that, if you take care of this, you can dig up the lawn,  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:48):**  you can farm it, you can do whatever.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:49):**  As long as you clean up the area around, keep it nice and tidy and grow your vegetables  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:54):**  and give us some veggies each week, you can just use it.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:57):**  And so that's pretty much where I started.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:00):**  And I built a home base on that site at the time.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:02):**  I had that home base for four years there.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:04):**  I had a little nursery there, like a 200 square foot nursery.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:07):**  I had a little garage that I rented.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:08):**  I grew micro greens in there in the winter.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:10):**  It was sort of my post-harvest area where I'd wash veggies and stuff.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:14):**  Had a walk-in cooler in there.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:15):**  I did most of my farming there.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:17):**  But then I just kept getting offered other land.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:19):**  Like people would just walk by and they would see what I was doing and they'd go wow, this  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:24):**  is so cool.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:25):**  Why don't you come and do my yard?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:27):**  And so for a number of years, I just kept saying yes to everybody, which was a mistake  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:33):**  back then.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:34):**  I mean, it was great that I did it and it was great that I went through that experience  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:36):**  of trying to grow the business.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:39):**  But I got to a point where I just had too many plots of land all over the city.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:42):**  They were really spread out.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:43):**  And so that wasn't very efficient for managing a business day in and day out.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:48):**  But that's essentially how I started was just by this one place.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:52):**  And then by making it look really good, people just kept walking by and saying wow, what  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:58):**  a great idea.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:59):**  So I did try knocking on doors to finding land when I first started.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:03):**  But that never yielded anything because you knock on somebody's door and you're like,  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:07):**  hi, I'm Curtis.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:08):**  They're like, oh God, it's a Jehovah's Witness.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:10):**  And then they immediately don't really want to talk to you.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:13):**  So that never led to anything.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:16):**  And the moral of the story here is I always tell people is like if you want to find land  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:21):**  and farm in the way that I am, just start in some place.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:25):**  Just start with one place somewhere and you'll garner a lot of interest from the community  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:31):**  just by doing it and making it look good.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:33):**  Yeah, I really love that story, especially because you talk about unexpected ways to  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:38):**  farm different types of land within an urban setting.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:41):**  Now for those of my listeners who would like to try and do the same, could you give us  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:45):**  some advice on how you go about selecting ideal land in these settings?  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:51):**  Especially because you said before that you scaled back your operation quite a bit from  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:55):**  having larger acreage in the beginning.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:57):**  So I'm guessing that you have a pretty detailed list of criteria on how to select land that's  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:02):**  ideal for market gardening.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:03):**  Yeah, sorry, are we talking about urban land?  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:06):**  Yeah, let's stick just with urban land.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:08):**  Okay, so if we're talking about urban land, there's sort of like a list of criteria I  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:14):**  go through.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:15):**  First of all, who owns the land and are they a person that you like?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:20):**  That's number one.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:21):**  If it's a person that you don't think you can deal with on a regular basis, don't farm  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:26):**  the land.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:27):**  You have to work with it.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:28):**  Relationships are paramount to all of this.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:30):**  You have to have good relationships.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:31):**  You have to find people that you want to work with and people that want to work with you  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:35):**  and really believe in what you're doing.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:37):**  That's number one.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:39):**  Number two would be the logistics of the site, like as far as location.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:44):**  Is it close to where you want to be?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:46):**  Like if you're farming in a multi-locational context like I am, you want your plots of  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:52):**  land to be relatively close to one another.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:54):**  If you have to crisscross a big city to go one plot to the other, you will waste a lot  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:59):**  of time in transit and that's really important.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:03):**  My farm is really consolidated and consolidated and consolidated over the years and I'm to  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:08):**  the point now where I'm going to be buying my neighbor's houses and eventually in maybe  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:13):**  five years or so, I'll probably own all of my farm in one place and then just have a  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:18):**  bunch of rental houses on it.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:20):**  But it starts where you're taking not quite ideal places but then over time, you'll meet  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:27):**  more people and find more ideal places.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:29):**  But the location is really important, needless to say.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:32):**  Number three is probably something like is that soil contaminated?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:37):**  If it's contaminated, I don't use it at all.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:39):**  If somebody says, hey, there was a gas station on this site a number of years ago, it's okay,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:45):**  forget about it.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:46):**  I won't even bother.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:47):**  If there was some like some chemicals dumped there, if there's like potential heavy metals  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:53):**  in the soil, I just won't use it at all.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:55):**  And that's not to say that you can't because certainly anybody listening to this who's  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:00):**  from a bigger city in the US or Canada or even worldwide, sometimes you are going to  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:06):**  farm on sites that have contamination and you can do that.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:10):**  You can build up new organic matter and bring in a whole new bunch of soil on it, it's just  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:16):**  costly.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:17):**  So for me, it's just there's other lots that could be more promising.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:21):**  So if something's contaminated, I won't even bother using it.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:25):**  Something like number four would be, are there any major shade structures around that site?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:30):**  Like if you're in a high density urban area, are there any neighboring buildings that are  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:36):**  going to cause a lot of light loss during the day?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:41):**  Anything on the south, if you're in the Northern Hemisphere, isn't good.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:44):**  If you're in the Southern Hemisphere, anything on the north.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:48):**  You know, even if you're in the suburban or like peri-urban areas, I'm in more of a suburban  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:53):**  city.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:54):**  And the biggest concern for me is trees, like other trees.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:58):**  Are there big deciduous or evergreen trees around that are going to cause a lot of shade?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:02):**  That's really important there.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:05):**  Something like number five is like access to water.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:08):**  Do you have, you know, where's the water coming from?  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:11):**  Is it a tap on a faucet on the side of the house?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:14):**  Is it close by?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:15):**  Is it accessible?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:16):**  That's really important.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:18):**  Maybe a number six would be access.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:20):**  Like how do you get in and out of that site?  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:23):**  You know, is it really nebulous to get in there?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:27):**  Because if you're going to be coming into this site on a daily basis or a few times  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:31):**  a week, you need to have good access.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:34):**  I'm kind of just going down a random list.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:36):**  I don't know how many I'll arrive at.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:37):**  Number seven, I would say something like, what are the neighbors like?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:41):**  What's the neighborhood that that piece of land is in?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:47):**  Are the people around you, do you feel like there's a good level of trust in that neighborhood  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:52):**  and that you feel safe doing that?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:57):**  You know, maybe a number eight would be, is there fencing?  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:00):**  Or do you need fencing?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:02):**  Some plots you don't need fencing on, most you do.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:04):**  And so that can be a pretty big concern.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:07):**  Like if you don't have any fence on there, well then anybody can walk through there.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:12):**  Especially if it's a corner lot, then people are going to cut through and some people just  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:16):**  won't respect your produce.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:18):**  They'll just walk over it.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:20):**  And so fencing is pretty important.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:24):**  I would say, let's leave it at that because I could probably keep going.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:27):**  But those would be the main eight that I would really look at before I considered any taking  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:33):**  on a plot.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:35):**  Yeah, that's a really excellent list and I also really agree with the order that you  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:39):**  put them in.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:40):**  Now, one of the keys that you've promoted to reach profitable market gardening is to  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:43):**  select high market value crops and focus on those.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:46):**  Can you walk us through the way that you evaluate which crops will give you the highest return  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:51):**  and which only seem good on the surface?  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:54):**  Yeah, so basically I've narrowed it down to five characteristics.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:00):**  There could be more.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:01):**  Like if you were to look at other considerations when you look at a vegetable.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:07):**  But I've narrowed it down to five that are, if you can meet three out of five or four  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:12):**  to five or better yet, five out of five of these characteristics, you can have a profitable  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:18):**  crop.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:19):**  So number one is popularity.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:20):**  The crops got to be popular and in demand.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:23):**  Number two is days to maturity.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:26):**  How many days does that crop take to get to harvest?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:29):**  I'm targeting generally something that's 60 days or less.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:33):**  Number three is yield per linear foot in bed.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:36):**  So I want to get at least half a pound per foot in my 30 inch beds.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:44):**  Number four is price per pound.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:46):**  So I want to get something that is like four dollars a pound or higher.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:50):**  And then number five is seasonality.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:52):**  So how long and how much of the season can I grow that crop?  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:56):**  Like winter squash, you plant it in May, you don't harvest it until August.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:00):**  Whereas leafy greens and baby root vegetables, like a lot of the crops that I grow, I can  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:05):**  plant and harvest them for eight months of the year.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:09):**  So basically, with those five criteria, that is my sort of the lens that I put everything  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:16):**  through.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:17):**  It's sort of a filter.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:18):**  And what I tell farmers is that the smaller your farm, the more of those criteria you  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:25):**  want to meet.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:26):**  So if you want to farm and make money and make a living off, say a quarter acre of land,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:32):**  you need to pick crops that are going to score five out of five of that criteria.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:37):**  Whereas if you are on, say, an acre of land, you could probably go down to crops that are  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:43):**  low as two out of five.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:45):**  You might have a garden variety there.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:48):**  Because generally on a larger farm, you need to have more diversity to move that product,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:52):**  unless you've got some really sweet market stream where you're very specialized and somebody's  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:56):**  buying hundreds or thousands of pounds of salad greens from you a week.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:00):**  But that's unlikely for most market growers.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:03):**  Generally we're targeting direct consumer market streams.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:05):**  So that's basically what I tell most farmers.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:10):**  A lot of urban farmers who come into this come from permaculture.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:16):**  And that's exactly where I came from.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:18):**  And we come in all wide-eyed and bushy tailed and we want to grow all kinds of cool stuff  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:22):**  for all kinds of various reasons, but it's just not practical.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:27):**  And again, at the end of the day, you got to pay bills.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:31):**  So we all might have some kind of ideals about not wanting to be on the grid and not wanting  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:38):**  to pay bills, but the reality is you do.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:41):**  Especially if you have children or you have a family to support, you have to pay bills.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:46):**  So unfortunately the world works in dollars and cents.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:49):**  So if your farm isn't making money, you're not going to last very long.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:53):**  And that's just the hard truth that I've seen played out many times with not only myself,  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:59):**  but dozens of farmers that I've consulted for around North America.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:03):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:04):**  Now, another often overlooked aspect to profitable urban farming is setting up economical infrastructure  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:11):**  for starting, maintaining and processing your plants for market.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:16):**  What have been some of the most essential tools and equipment that have made your job  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:19):**  a lot easier and more efficient?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:21):**  Okay, so I guess you're referring to like the post-harvest stuff.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:28):**  So I mean really you need to have a walk-in cooler, at least one walk-in cooler if you're  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:34):**  going to run a commercial farm.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:35):**  Like don't even consider trying to do it without.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:38):**  Some people think they can get away with using refurbished home refrigerators.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:44):**  You can't.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:45):**  Just trust me on this one, it doesn't work.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:46):**  I've seen people try it over and over again and they just suffer.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:49):**  So you need to have a walk-in cooler because you can throw big totes of product in there  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:54):**  right off the field and you need to cool product when it's harvested to get the field heat  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:58):**  off it, otherwise it starts to degrade.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:01):**  That makes it so you can market that product for a few three or four days or potentially  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:07):**  a week after it was harvested.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:09):**  If your product is going to spoil the next day, then your window of selling it is one  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:13):**  day.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:14):**  So you can't really farm, like reasonably economically farm without proper cold storage.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:20):**  So that's number one.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:22):**  Things like washing infrastructure, you know we've got quite a bit of really specialized  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:28):**  and do-it-yourself stuff on our farm.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:30):**  I mean if people go to my YouTube channel, if they just search urban farmer Curtis Stone,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:34):**  they'll see a lot of the stuff.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:35):**  You can just use the search on my channel and put in like post-harvest and you'll get  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:40):**  all kinds of stuff.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:41):**  But one that's really important for us is a washing table.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:44):**  So it's basically just a three foot by eight foot wide table that has a galvanized steel  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:50):**  mesh on it, but it also has a pool liner underneath that deflects the water when we wash into  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:55):**  a bin that has a pump and we pump that water off the property.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:59):**  So that's like our wastewater really, but we actually use it to irrigate some of our  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:03):**  perennial crops around on the farm.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:05):**  But so we wash like our root veggies on there, any kind of wet work is done on that table.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:10):**  That table is very important.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:12):**  It's sort of the centerpiece in our whole post-harvest area.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:15):**  And then we've got like all of our infrastructure for washing greens.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:19):**  And greens is like the majority of what we produce on our farm, it's probably like 80%  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:23):**  of what we produce.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:25):**  And then we've got a greens washing machine called a bubbler.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:28):**  It's basically like a big jacuzzi.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:30):**  You put greens in it and then it makes air bubbles and it shakes all the dirt and bugs  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:37):**  and stuff off the greens and then from there they go into a spinner, just a big salad spinner.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:43):**  I have two of them.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:44):**  They're just modified washing machines that have big bins in them that spin.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:50):**  And this spins it just like you would any home salad spinner but on a commercial scale.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:55):**  And then our greens go onto another screen after that with fans on it that's called a  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:00):**  greens dryer.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:01):**  And that just gets any standing water off the greens, makes them a little bit drier  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:06):**  so that they pack better and that they last longer on the shelf.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:10):**  And that's the majority of our washing infrastructure.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:14):**  We have infrastructure for packing product.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:17):**  We've got scales and benches and bags and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:23):**  But that's mostly what's in our post-harvest area.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:26):**  Yeah, that's really important and it's something that people often overlook, which is just  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:30):**  how much effort and work goes into making your products presentable enough to actually  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:34):**  sell well at market.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:37):**  It's funny because you're dead on.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:40):**  It's the number one thing that I find people overlook and they think they can kind of wait  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:46):**  till the end to do that stuff and then they suffer the classic burnout is that summer  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:51):**  comes on and they got lots of product coming off the field and they don't have a place  
**[0:21:55-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:55):**  to put it or a proper system in place to wash it and process it and pack it and store it.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:02):**  And the number one thing I tell all of my consulting clients or students is that if  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:08):**  you're going to take some time to prepare your farm, get your land in production, get  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:13):**  your land getting prepared quickly like rototill it, tarp it or whatever you're going to do  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:20):**  and then start working on your post-harvest infrastructure.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:23):**  Your post-harvest infrastructure should be finished well before you have crops coming  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:27):**  off the field.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:28):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:30):**  That's super important.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:31):**  Now because you select crops that mature and can be harvested quickly, many of which even  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:35):**  offer multiple cuttings and harvest before replanting, you've been able to put in a system  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:40):**  of high rotation beds and manage the organization and yields for better consistency.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:46):**  Can you break down that system for us and give an example of how it works through a  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:49):**  growing season?  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:51):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:53):**  So you know a bit about my book.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:55):**  You're using my terminology which is great.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:59):**  So high rotation essentially means an area that is in high rotation.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:04):**  So everything on our farm is a standardized 30-inch bed.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:08):**  The length varies a little bit.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:09):**  For the most part, we have 50-foot beds.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:13):**  So 30 inches wide by 50 feet long.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:16):**  And in order to make our farm more profitable on such a small piece of land, like we did  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:21):**  just over $100,000 on our third of an acre last year.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:24):**  We did that because everything on my farm is high rotation, meaning that every single  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:29):**  bed on the farm will be planted on average at least four times.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:33):**  So in the springtime, I might have a bed that's spinach.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:38):**  So it's planted kind of 45 to 60 days past and we have harvested it once or twice.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:45):**  So with greens, it's mostly at the very least we get two cuts.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:48):**  So we get one cut and then it'll grow back in like seven to two weeks depending on the  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:55):**  time of season, get another cut and then we'll turn it under or we'll pull it out, amend  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:02):**  the soil with compost or some sort of organic fertilizer and then replant that bed to something  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:08):**  else.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:09):**  So then maybe it'll go to radishes.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:10):**  So then those radishes are out in 30 days, we completely crop it out and then we'll turn  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:16):**  it over and plant something else.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:18):**  Maybe at that point, it'll go to lettuce.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:20):**  Then it'll be lettuce for say 75 days including getting two or three cuts off it.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:26):**  And then we'll pull that out, amend the soil again with some organic nutrients and then  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:32):**  plant it again.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:33):**  Maybe at this point, it'll go to fall carrots and then those carrots will be in the ground  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:36):**  until October, harvest them.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:38):**  So that's how one bed that's sort of the timeline of one bed might look like.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:42):**  So we're basically repeating that over hundreds of times in a season.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:48):**  So we have on our farm, we have 70 50-foot beds on our farm.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:54):**  And so when I wrote my book, I basically give people an economic benchmark in that if you  
**[0:25:01-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:01):**  do high rotation planting and you've got 25 or 50-foot beds, on a 50-foot bed, you should  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:10):**  be able to make on average $1600 per bed per season.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:15):**  So that's an average growing season.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:16):**  I'm in North America, I'm in Canada and I have a slightly shorter season than some people  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:21):**  in the US would.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:23):**  So if you add that up, so for our farm, 70 beds, all high rotation at $1600, that comes  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:30):**  to $112,000.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:32):**  So that's the economic potential of our farm.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:36):**  It doesn't mean you're going to make that, but that's the potential.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:39):**  And so that's the basis of what that all means is that we're continuously rotating our beds.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:46):**  Now one thing to keep in mind is most of the crops I grow are what we call low feeders,  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:53):**  like lettuce, radishes, spinach, arugula, mustard greens, turnips.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:00):**  Those crops are low feeders, meaning they don't actually draw that much from the soil.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:05):**  So I mean I'm adding organic matter to my soil every time, every crop, but I'm putting  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:12):**  more in than I'm taking out.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:14):**  And that's important because if you're taking out more than you're putting in, then it's  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:18):**  diminishing returns and your soil is only going to get worse.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:20):**  But in organic farming, which I'm not a certified organic farmer, but I do follow all practices  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:26):**  regarding farming organically.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:28):**  Most of my inputs that I use are organic or certified organic at least.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:32):**  And the idea is that you have to maintain the biology of your soil.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:37):**  An organic farm is dependent on biological processes within the soil structure to deliver  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:45):**  a yield from your crops, whereas in conventional farming it's not biology, it's basically just  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:49):**  chemical or petrochemical inputs.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:51):**  So we need to maintain that biology and we do that by making our soil better continuously.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:57):**  I'm actually really glad you got into that because that was going to be my next question.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:01):**  Because obviously with so many high rotation beds, soil fertility must be paramount.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:05):**  And while I know you said that some of your main cash crops are plants that don't require  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:10):**  a whole lot from the soil, but you also have others like tomatoes that do.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:14):**  And so I'm curious as to other than compost, can you talk to us a little bit about how  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:19):**  you manage soil health and ways that help you to achieve such high yields and turnover?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:26):**  So basically it's not really anything, it's certainly nothing new.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:31):**  I don't think I've really created any new content as far as soil fertility.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:39):**  At the beginning of the season we put one to two inches of really good finished compost  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:44):**  into all of our beds.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:46):**  And so that gets, doesn't get rototilled in.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:49):**  We actually for the most part do a very shallow till.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:53):**  We don't rototill our beds.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:55):**  We do sometimes.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:57):**  Sometimes it's necessary, but we just do it at the beginning of the season.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:59):**  We might be putting a cover crop like a fall rye mixed with peas in there and we'll rototill  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:06):**  it in that context and then shape the beds.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:09):**  And then from there on throughout the season it's a very shallow cultivation we're doing  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:13):**  between each crop.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:14):**  And that's part of the soil fertility there too.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:17):**  But it's a continuous adding of organic matter in the top layer of the soil profile that  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:24):**  continuously keeps building up that loam.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:27):**  So our basic protocol is, so at the beginning of the season we put in a thick layer of compost  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:32):**  on each bed.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:33):**  We use a tool called a tilther that basically just tills that into the top inch of the soil.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:39):**  So it doesn't really till it in, it more just mixes it in with the top layer of soil.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:43):**  And then we get a nice clean seed bed that we can plant into from there.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:49):**  And then, and then you know of course we fork the beds.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:52):**  So before we actually put in that compost the beds get forked with a digging fork.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:57):**  We don't use a broad fork, we just use a digging fork.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:59):**  They get about 10 inches of forking down below to open up the soil, aerate the soil.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:07):**  Then we've got the compost that goes on.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:09):**  Then we're ready to plant.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:10):**  From there throughout the season we're pulling out a crop, we're amending the soil again  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:15):**  and planting again.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:16):**  But what we're doing is we're not using compost at this time mostly because of logistics.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:22):**  Because to use, to put buckets and buckets and buckets of compost on a bed each time  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:27):**  is time consuming and quite labor intensive.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:29):**  So through our mid-season rotations we switch to a more compact fertilizer which is, it  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:36):**  is compost essentially but we're using a composted certified organic turkey manure.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:42):**  And that goes, we sprinkle that on each bed after each crop.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:47):**  And then we fork the bed just like we did at the beginning and then we use the tilther  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:53):**  to do that little shallow cultivation of that fertilizer and then we replant.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:58):**  So that's basically it.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:59):**  I mean, something else that's slightly nuanced but is somewhat relevant to the discussion  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:03):**  is that, is our management of our weeds.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:06):**  So we use a technique called stale seed bedding.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:10):**  And the basic idea is there that we are encouraging weed growth as early as we can and then we're  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:19):**  eliminating that by putting tarps on the soil and smothering the weeds out.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:23):**  Or we're using a flame weeder tool that we walk right along the surface of the soil that's  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:29):**  boiling those little germinating weed seeds and we're managing from there.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:34):**  And then because we're not really rototilling throughout the season, we're not bringing  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:38):**  up new weed seeds and we're not putting down any weed seeds either.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:42):**  So we're kind of disrupting that whole weed cycle.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:45):**  And we're essentially trying to tackle the weeds even before they become a problem so  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:51):**  that we're continuously reducing our weed pressure over time.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:54):**  Yeah, that's really important.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:56):**  Now I know one of the advantages that you've listed to growing crops in an urban environment  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:01):**  is the easier access to the market.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:04):**  Now what have been some of your most reliable ways of selling your produce and how can other  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:09):**  urban farmers tap into those markets for themselves?  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:13):**  Well I mean it really is about direct consumer market streams.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:17):**  At least that's how it was when I started.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:19):**  My farm is a lot different now even than when I wrote my book because my book is about almost  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:25):**  three years old now from when it was written.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:28):**  And so I really encourage farmers when they're starting to get into direct consumer market  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:34):**  streams like farmers.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:36):**  So direct consumer means direct to the consumer, so there's no middleman.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:39):**  So farmers markets, communities supported agriculture like veggie box programs and selling  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:45):**  to like restaurants.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:46):**  So that's how I started but it's not quite how it is today.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:51):**  What was the first part of the question?  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:53):**  Oh right, adventures to be in the city.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:55):**  So the big advantage that urban farmers have over rural farmers is that they're just simply  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:01):**  in the marketplace.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:02):**  And we live in the city, the farms are in the city and people see them.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:07):**  So that has a huge benefit in just that insofar as that people walk by and they see the farm.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:15):**  And they get interested in the farm and they become your customers.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:20):**  So it's really that simple and that's by far the biggest advantage that we have.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:27):**  You know, when you're selling outside of the city, you've got to commute into the city  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:31):**  to not only deliver product but also build relationships.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:34):**  And it's the building of relationships that's the thing that most people don't really factor  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:38):**  in when they're thinking about starting a business.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:41):**  But just like I said at the beginning when we were talking about land and finding land,  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:47):**  relationships are the most important part.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:49):**  Because if you don't, those relationships are paramount to everything you do going forward.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:56):**  Because without good relationships, you don't have continuous customers or you don't have  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:01):**  reoccurring customers I should say.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:03):**  And so you need to have those and you know, farming is becoming, it can be competitive.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:10):**  It's certainly very competitive where I live.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:12):**  I don't encourage anybody to come to Kelowna to start a market garden.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:15):**  It's extremely competitive here.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:17):**  There's so many organic growers here.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:20):**  So it's good to be in a marketplace that is a little bit less saturated for sure.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:25):**  But you know, if you have a niche, you can pretty much go anywhere.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:29):**  If you're a really good people person and you're good at building relationships, you  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:32):**  can succeed anywhere.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:34):**  But that's not often where many farmers are.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:38):**  But certainly the biggest advantage we have in the city is the fact that people see our  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:41):**  farm and we're accessible and we're you know, people get that connection to where their  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:48):**  food comes from.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:49):**  And I think that's really important.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:50):**  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:52):**  And that's another one of those aspects that like you said, a lot of people overlook.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:56):**  Especially in that urban setting, relationship building is going to be absolutely key to  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:01):**  selling directly to your customers and not missing out on some profits that would otherwise  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:05):**  be taken by the middleman.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:08):**  So there certainly is disadvantages.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:11):**  I mean, one is that you've got, well, you've got to deal with the city.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:18):**  You've got to deal with bureaucracy or you know, zoning issues.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:27):**  If you're in the US, HOAs which are, we're so lucky we don't have those in Canada.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:32):**  Those are so draconian.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:34):**  I've been able to do a lot of what I've been able to do because we don't have HOAs and  
**[0:34:38-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:38):**  we actually have a very progressive city that really supports entrepreneurialism.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:45):**  So my city's been very supportive of, not supportive because they've never given me  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:49):**  anything.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:50):**  Actually they've given me some awards but they've never given me money.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:53):**  I've never asked for money either but they've just, they've kind of got out of the way and  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:57):**  let me kind of do my thing.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:59):**  But that can certainly be a big barrier if you're farming in the city.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:05):**  Another is if you're multi-locational, you've got logistics of managing that.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:09):**  So you have to run around from place to place opposed to just having one single site which  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:13):**  would certainly make it easier and eventually I might move on to a single site or I'm actually  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:18):**  trying to do it by buying my neighbor's homes and consolidating my farm into one place.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:25):**  You know, you've got things like vandalism or theft which has actually never been an  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:29):**  issue for us but they can be in certain places for certain people.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:35):**  We've been really fortunate that that's, you know, nobody's ever vandalized or stolen anything  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:40):**  from my garden.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:41):**  At least to my knowledge having said that if somebody were to go in and take a few radishes,  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:45):**  I probably wouldn't even notice.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:48):**  I would say those are the main things.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:50):**  I mean, another one that is an advantage and a disadvantage is the heat island effect.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:55):**  So I mean, it's a great advantage on the shoulder season when you want to get crops in the ground  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:01):**  earlier and you know, I've got 45 more frost free days in downtown Kelowna than people  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:07):**  who are just outside the city do because the city has a heat island effect.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:11):**  It's called where it's a thermal mass that absorbs heat and it holds heat.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:15):**  So the cities are, you know, on average five degrees warmer than they are outside.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:18):**  So that's an advantage and a disadvantage.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:20):**  It's a disadvantage in the summer because it is significantly hotter in the city than  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:24):**  it is outside.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:25):**  So for example, the last few weeks, it's been, we got up to 107 degrees Fahrenheit or 40  
**[0:36:34-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:34):**  degrees Celsius downtown and it was 32 degrees or under 100, like 92 or something like that  
**[0:36:43-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:43):**  outside the city.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:44):**  So it can work both ways.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:46):**  In the summer, it's certainly a disadvantage.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:49):**  So those would be the main ones I think of right off the top of my head.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:51):**  Yeah, I could definitely see how those would get in the way but it sounds like you've got  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:55):**  a good system of dealing with them or at least mitigating them for your circumstances.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:00):**  Now I want to get back to one of the things that you talked about right at the beginning  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:03):**  of this podcast and that's that you've been able to pretty much double your revenue for  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:08):**  each successive year since the beginning and I was wondering if you could talk about some  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:13):**  of the key things that you've done in order to achieve that.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:16):**  Yes.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:18):**  So that is all about doubling down on the 80-20.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:21):**  So the 80-20, for those of you who don't know, the Pareto Principle is, I won't explain the  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:26):**  history of the Pareto Principle though if you're interested looking it up, you should  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:29):**  look it up because it is very interesting.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:31):**  I find it's actually a universal principle everywhere in the world but basically looking  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:35):**  at what delivers the most value for the least amount of input.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:39):**  So many people will say 20% of your customers are 80% of your business, 20% of your products  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:45):**  will be 80% of your revenue, so on and so forth.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:49):**  And so, what I've done is I've essentially applied the 80-20 to everything on my farm  
**[0:37:56-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:56):**  from products to seed varieties to customers to methodology in the field, everything.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:08):**  Anything that was delivering say 20% for 80% input, we got rid of.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:14):**  And so, I've only keep the things that are meeting that 80-20 criteria.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:20):**  And so, the one thing like in the first number of years, it was things like, okay, let's  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:26):**  just like refine our crop selection.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:28):**  Let's make our crop selection better.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:30):**  So the biggest milestone I had there was from my fourth year to my fifth year in farming.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:38):**  My fourth year, I had eight people working on the operation.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:42):**  We had two and a half acres and I grew about 90 different types of crops, like including  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:49):**  varieties and all that kinds of stuff and it's very diversified.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:52):**  But I discovered in that year that there was 10 crops that were literally bringing in 80%  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:59):**  of the revenue over the farm.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:01):**  So I radically restructured my operation that year.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:04):**  I dropped 80 of those crops.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:07):**  I pretty much went with 10 and I made more money that year, worked less and had a way  
**[0:39:14-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:14):**  better quality of life.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:16):**  So ever since then, the things that I've doubled down on, I mean, I've continuously refined  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:22):**  what I'm growing and what I'm not growing.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:25):**  But the thing that really made a considerable effort in the later years was doubling down  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:30):**  on the types of customers that I wanted.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:33):**  So it was basically identifying out of all the customers I had, so let's say for example,  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:39):**  I would have say 20 different restaurants I was selling to.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:43):**  I had a CSA box program and I had a farmer's market every Saturday.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:47):**  I basically looked at that, all those revenue streams, so those are three revenue streams  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:52):**  there, and I said, okay, of the restaurants, let's eliminate the customers that are really  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:58):**  high maintenance and are low volume.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:00):**  So if it's a chef and they take up a lot of my time, they don't pay their bills on time  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:06):**  and they don't even order that much stuff, they're gone.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:10):**  Just forget about it, not even engaging them anymore.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:14):**  With the other market streams in recent years, like last year, we dropped our farmer's market.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:19):**  Three years before that, I dropped my CSA and then I pretty much specialized in restaurants  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:25):**  and then I started selling more to food aggregators, like food hubs.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:30):**  I basically buy product from local farmers and then redistribute it in a box program  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:34):**  and then I started selling to grocery stores.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:37):**  And so that was pretty much it there, was continuously finding the gravy, like finding  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:43):**  the cream.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:44):**  Like what's the best return for the least amount of work?  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:49):**  And I always find looking at sort of the customer, I call it the customer spectrum, it's like  
**[0:40:54-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:54):**  you've got...  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:56):**  I break it down to two categories, how much maintenance they require and how much volume  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:01):**  they buy.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:02):**  So a customer that is low maintenance and high volume, meaning that they're easy to  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:07):**  deal with and they buy a lot of product, that is like your all-star number one customer.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:12):**  Customers in the middle might be high maintenance, but they buy high volume so you'll tolerate  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:16):**  them because at the end of the day, they might spend $1,000 a week, they're worth your time  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:22):**  even though they might send you 10 or 20 text messages a week, they're still worth it.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:27):**  And then on the cutoff point, on the other end, you've got low volume and high maintenance  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:34):**  customers.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:35):**  So they don't buy a lot, but they're high maintenance to deal with.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:37):**  Cut those ones out immediately and then decide where you want to draw the line on the others.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:41):**  Even recently, in recent years for us, I've cut out a lot of customers that were high  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:46):**  maintenance and high volume because to me, life is short.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:50):**  And I've been in business long enough now that we've got sort of an incumbent status  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:55):**  where we are with our farm that nobody's really going to come in and out-compete us, at least  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:00):**  without us getting a really good idea of what was happening.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:05):**  So that I'm just not really so worried about it.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:07):**  To me, it's more about quality of life.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:09):**  Like sure, it's great to make a lot of money on the farm, but at the end of the day, I  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:13):**  want to have time to spend with my daughter and my family and I want to enjoy what I'm  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:18):**  doing.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:19):**  And if there's a customer that I don't enjoy dealing with, I just don't engage them anymore.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:23):**  That's really fantastic advice.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:25):**  And I know even for myself and also for many of the people that I've interviewed on this  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:29):**  podcast that that 80-20 principle has been absolutely key for them to actually turn a  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:34):**  profit in their business and get away from an enterprise that's really just letting them  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:39):**  get by.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:40):**  So what would be some advice that you would give to someone who wanted to get started  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:43):**  farming in the city for themselves?  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:46):**  What would be some of the first steps that you would advise them to take?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:49):**  Well I would say right off the bat, this is something I don't think I've ever said in  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:54):**  an interview, is do you really need to farm in the city for one?  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:01):**  A lot of people come to urban agriculture because it's hip, like it's cool to farm in  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:08):**  the city and it certainly is and there is a lot to be said about the quality of life  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:13):**  and getting to know people in your community and neighborhood, that's really awesome.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:18):**  But if you have an opportunity to farm slightly outside of the city and you've got more of  
**[0:43:23-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:23):**  an ideal situation as far as logistics and land go, there's nothing wrong with that.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:30):**  I think a half hour commute into a town isn't really that big of a deal.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:35):**  Whereas a couple hours, certainly that's something else.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:38):**  But a half hour isn't so bad, you can almost be farming in the city in that same context.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:43):**  So, if you're going to farm in the city, you want to really figure out an ideal logistical  
**[0:43:55-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:55):**  land base.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:57):**  If you're too spread out, then it's going to cause a lot of inefficiencies and wasted  
**[0:44:05-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:05):**  time in transit, so that's really key.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:08):**  Another thing is you have to utilize mini-monocultures.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:12):**  A lot of people who come into this from permaculture, they think that everything has to be like  
**[0:44:17-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:17):**  a forest garden or like this ultimate biodiverse little garden and it doesn't because in a  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:25):**  city there's actually a lot of biodiversity.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:26):**  You got trees, you got neighbors gardens, you got all things around you, all kinds of  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:30):**  things around you that a 500 square foot plot of spinach isn't a monoculture.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:35):**  It's a mini-monoculture within a greater biodiversity.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:38):**  So, for the sake of making things logistical and simple, it's way easier to have little  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:46):**  specialized monocultures and you'll rotate them throughout the season, but that's really  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:50):**  important.  
**[0:44:52-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:52):**  A lot of urban farmers I see too, they get into it because it's like a social justice  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:00):**  thing.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:02):**  And I think that's fine as far as intent, but it doesn't really deliver on the end.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:09):**  That if that's your mission and at the end of the day you don't have a business, then  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:15):**  you're not even going to succeed at the social justice.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:18):**  So, you need to make a business a business.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:21):**  And then all those other things that you want to do, whether they be good things in the  
**[0:45:25-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:25):**  community, environmental things, or economic sustainability and so on and so forth, you  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:32):**  have to make a sustainable business first.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:35):**  Because if you don't, you won't last and you won't achieve those other goals.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:38):**  So I'd say those would be the main ones.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:41):**  And I mean, I guess lastly, get the right equipment.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:44):**  I see some urban farmers, I'm not kidding you, that have been farming for like five  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:49):**  years and they're still sowing seeds with their fingertips.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:52):**  That's insane.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:53):**  Get the right equipment.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:55):**  Get a walk-in cooler.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:56):**  Get a good post-harvest station.  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:58):**  Get the right tools.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:59):**  Make sure you've got a seeder.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:00):**  Make sure you've got good infrastructure to start a nursery.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:03):**  Because you can kill so much time without that stuff.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:08):**  And these tools have been around for a long time.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:10):**  There's really nothing new.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:12):**  Of course there's lots of new stuff out there that is absolutely game changing.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:17):**  But start with, you need to have a seeder.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:20):**  Start with some of the basic infrastructure and then work up to the other things as you  
**[0:46:24-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:24):**  get some capital cushion from your operation.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:27):**  Yeah, that's fantastic advice.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:30):**  Like you said, cutting out all of these things that people aren't taught in maybe their permaculture  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:34):**  design courses or general gardening courses but are essential to actually making it a  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:39):**  business.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:40):**  I'm really glad you touched on those.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:41):**  Now I personally am just such a huge fan of your book, your YouTube channel and even the  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:47):**  courses that you offer.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:48):**  How can people get in touch with you and learn more about urban farming and market gardening?  
**[0:46:53-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:53):**  The basic hub to find out about anything I'm doing is just go to my website, theurbanfarmer.co.

**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:47:15):**  I'm kind of taking a little hiatus until the fall.

**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:47:48):**  But thanks for sticking with it and it's been a ton of value for both me and my listeners.

**[0:49:01-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:01):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:04):**  months.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:05):**  And I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad Goodsy.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:09):**  Hey buddy, what's new?  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:11):**  Oh man, so much is happening.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:14):**  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:17):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:49:20-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:20):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:23):**  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics  
**[0:49:27-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:27):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:29):**  As you know, we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:33):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:37):**  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:49:42-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:42):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:48):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:50):**  Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:55):**  Yeah, that's for sure.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:56):**  It's life changing.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:57):**  But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:02):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:08):**  of our intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:10):**  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:15):**  know of available anywhere.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:18):**  Basically with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything  
**[0:50:22-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:22):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:28):**  That's what I'm excited about, man.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:29):**  But yeah, what about you?  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:31):**  What's going on?  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:32):**  Man, well, you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:50:36-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:36):**  season as well.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:37):**  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:50:42-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:42):**  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:45):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:50):**  to houses.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:52):**  And it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:54):**  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:59):**  methods for years and years to come.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:01):**  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:05):**  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:11):**  Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:13):**  And honestly, this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:17):**  too.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:18):**  I mean, this little town of Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala,  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:22):**  like right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan, it's one of the most beautiful places in the  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:26):**  world.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:27):**  And on top of that, you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich  
**[0:51:31-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:31):**  and alive.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:32):**  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:38):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:43):**  I mean, within walking distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:47):**  on.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:48):**  We got the projects that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat centers.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:52):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:55):**  You have Love Probiotics, you have Fungi Academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your  
**[0:52:01-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:01):**  mind type stuff.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:02):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:05):**  Yeah, it really does.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:07):**  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make  
**[0:52:11-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:11):**  sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:13):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:52:14-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:14):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:17):**  I mean, all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:21):**  the tuition.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:22):**  So this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:25):**  That's a great idea because I mean, people can still take just one course if that's what  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:29):**  they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks, but this will actually make the  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:33):**  two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:37):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:42):**  want to do.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:43):**  So hey, to all of you listening out there, we really want passionate and driven people  
**[0:52:47-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:47):**  like you to come and be a part of the community and the ecosystem that we're building out  
**[0:52:51-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:51):**  here.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:52):**  So if you're ready to take the next step and really dive in, there's no better time to  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:55):**  invest in yourself by joining us on this journey to a regenerative future.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:00):**  Shad, how can they get in touch with us and see the upcoming events and workshop schedule?  
**[0:53:04-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:04):**  For sure.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:05):**  Well, for start, they can either go to atilanorganics.com and click on the workshops tab or they can  
**[0:53:12-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:12):**  check out abundantedge.com and click on the education tab.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:17):**  Either one of these will get you all the information you need for all of the courses that we're  
**[0:53:21-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:21):**  offering in the months ahead.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:22):**  We're really looking forward to working and collaborating with all of you inspired and  
**[0:53:26-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:26):**  enthusiastic people out there.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:28):**  But even if you can't make it out yourself, I'm sure you know someone in your network  
**[0:53:32-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:32):**  who would jump at the chance to get involved in this positive, regenerative, and truly  
**[0:53:37-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:53:37):**  life-changing projects.

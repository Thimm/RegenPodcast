**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:00):**  Storytelling also promises something as well, and that's the belief and the hope, but hope  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:12):**  sounds too passive.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:14):**  A true, true story, like a transformational storytelling, ultimately promises a brighter,  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:21):**  better future.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:25):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:29):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:32):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:36):**  I am once again honored to be representing my friends at New Society Publishers, the  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:40):**  book publishers that were a big inspiration to me even before I started working with ecologies  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:46):**  and natural buildings and way before podcasting.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:49):**  Their titles like The Natural Plaster Book and Timber Framing for the Rest of Us really  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:54):**  made me believe that I could build my own home, which I eventually did.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:00:58):**  And later volumes like Ecopreneuring, Unlearn Re Wild, and Building Community have offered  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:03):**  tons of inspiration and even helped to shape my worldview.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:07):**  Whether you're looking for practical tips on growing and preserving food, exploring  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:11):**  complex challenges in your own life, or sometimes just searching for hope and inspiration in  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:16):**  a crazy world where you don't feel like you fit in, you'll find exactly what you're looking  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:20):**  for and more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:25):**  I remember distinctly the time that a storyteller came to my middle school when I was in 7th  
**[0:01:30-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:30):**  grade.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:31):**  At that point in my school experience, like for many others, it consisted of being talked  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:35):**  to all day by someone at the front of the class while I struggled to pay attention and  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:38):**  not fidget.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:39):**  But this was different.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:41):**  This woman's story and the way that she told it managed to hold an auditorium full of 12  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:46):**  and 13 year olds in silent attention hanging on her every word.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:50):**  I remember how she raised and lowered her voice to build tension, and how she would  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:01:55):**  quicken, or slow, her speech to convey energy and pace, and to use emotion to transport  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:01):**  us into the viewpoint of the characters and feel what they were feeling.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:06):**  I was truly impressed, and since then I've loved storytelling, especially live stories,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:11):**  and I envy those people who've mastered their way of speaking to elicit real emotion and  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:16):**  connection with an audience or even just an individual in conversation.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:21):**  And that's why today I'll be exploring the importance of storytelling in our modern lives  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:26):**  with one of my favorite authorities on the subject.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:28):**  Now Shannon Leahy is the founder of Lighthouse Storytelling and works with individuals and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:33):**  organizations to effectively communicate their stories through better writing and speaking.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:38):**  She told me right away just how far back storytelling has played a big part in her life, and why  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:43):**  it was so important from a very young age.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:46):**  Well I always like to say that when I grew up I very much had a father who I loved and  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:55):**  adored and there were four other orangutans, four other siblings, so we were a big Irish  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:02:59):**  family of five.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:01):**  Don't tell my sister, I often say that I come from a family of brothers, but you know when  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:06):**  you have really big voices you learn you're either going to be quiet or you're going to  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:11):**  just learn to get louder.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:13):**  And for my dad he used to sit at the head of the table and if you didn't actually have  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:18):**  a story to share in many ways you didn't have a place at his table.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:24):**  And over the years when I've shared that with audiences I've always been so amazed by what  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:29):**  they think that means and then they actually tell me how wonderful they think my childhood  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:34):**  was or how horrible it was.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:37):**  And what I meant was I discovered quite quickly that the way to entertain, to be seen, heard  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:45):**  and understood, especially as a middle child or Fawn nicknamed the forgotten child, was  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:52):**  to come to the table with a story and be able to actually communicate in a way that could  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:03:57):**  have command over the room.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:00):**  Now at the risk of that sounding unbelievably egomaniacal is as a kid that's like currency,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:07):**  right?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:08):**  I mean mom and dad are paying attention to me.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:09):**  I'm slowing down dinner.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:11):**  So I learned quickly that there was value to it and also too storytellers are also story  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:20):**  listeners, right?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:22):**  I always had a tremendous fascination with other people.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:26):**  So in terms of the value of stories and when people come to me and they're wanting to know  
**[0:04:31-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:31):**  how to tell a story, how to write it, much less how to perform it on stage, my advice  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:39):**  used to be quite unfashionable because my first step would be start listening to stories.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:46):**  And by listening to other people's stories you'll start finding your own and that's our  
**[0:04:50-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:04:50):**  great beautiful shared humanity that these days is we're really needing strong bridges  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:00):**  to bridge a gap that I'm absolutely shocked that the gap is as wide as it is right now.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:07):**  Before we go in deeper about techniques and strategies for better storytelling, let's  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:11):**  establish a baseline of where we're at as a storytelling culture because digital and  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:17):**  social media have changed the ways that we tell stories through their various platforms.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:22):**  Can you tell me some of the ways that this art form has been transformed recently?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:26):**  Oh, there's so how shall I count the ways?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:31):**  One of the biggest things I see and again, that fascination and being amazed by and really  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:39):**  working hard not to be frightened by it.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:43):**  It are two mindsets.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:45):**  Number one is that everyone has a story.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:49):**  I don't agree.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:50):**  So there I'm quite in the minority on that one, that everything is a story.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:53):**  Just like everyone has a right to an opinion, but if you dig deep into that, that becomes  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:58):**  part of the white noise.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:05:59):**  If everyone has an opinion, if everyone has a story, then ultimately we're all screaming  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:03):**  into the wind and back to bridge building.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:07):**  And the moat gets wider and wider.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:10):**  Number two, I'm really amazed to see how storytelling has been commercialized in the sense of remember  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:19):**  when it became really, really fashionable and everyone was a storyteller and you could  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:25):**  spend thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars on how to be a storyteller.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:30):**  And now journalists, at least here in Canada, you have journalists or newscasters who ultimately  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:36):**  you could say read prompts are now being called Canada's favorite storyteller.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:42):**  I don't want a journalist to be a storyteller.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:44):**  I want a journalist to be a journalist and then let me come to my own conclusions.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:49):**  And that really is what fundamentally, like it or not, stays the same in a true story,  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:06:56):**  is stories, their power and their potential for subversiveness.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:02):**  And that doesn't necessarily need to be negative or against the greater good, is that it shows  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:07):**  meaning without constricting itself to saying what the meaning is.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:13):**  So in simplest terms, a story invites a listener or reader to come to their own conclusions.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:21):**  And I bet, Oliver, that you likely enjoy changing your own mind rather than feeling berated  
**[0:07:30-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:30):**  and kind of like attacked to a point where you give up and you say, OK, fine, I'll agree.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:38):**  Because you might have changed your mind, but you sure haven't changed your heart about  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:42):**  me or about the view.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:44):**  So with so many stories, shall we say, out there and who's a storyteller and the person  
**[0:07:51-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:07:51):**  with the best story wins, I am also fascinated of how the term narrative is being used because  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:00):**  narrative and ideology are very, very different.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:03):**  And I'm finding being a word lover.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:06):**  There is a level of concern for me because ideology I see as a box.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:10):**  It's like the Dead Sea is that sure, new ideas can come in, but then nothing really goes  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:16):**  out.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:17):**  Nothing new is created.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:20):**  And yet a story can be can can be told last year and then be told right now and be told  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:26):**  next year and have completely different meaning.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:29):**  So I'm really quite.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:32):**  Really, really conscious of when we talk about narrative, narrative does not imply a storyline  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:39):**  because stories, ultimately the best stories, as I said earlier, are stories that remind  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:45):**  us of our shared humanity and how we truly, really are in all this together.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:50):**  And when I say in this, I mean in terms of our of our being human.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:08:57):**  The meaning of life, all the good stuff, right, love, compassion, joy.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:01):**  And then, of course, you as as I almost I almost dated myself and called you an environmentalist.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:06):**  But, you know, as someone who is so in tune with, you know, with Gaia, with with with  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:11):**  Mother Earth, you know, the environment regenerative policies.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:15):**  I mean, that's where you also see our our humanity there as well.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:20):**  So that's really what comes to mind for me is how with storytelling becoming so prevalent.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:29):**  And the quantity being so massive, I do believe that a lot of the quality has has been diluted.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:37):**  And I know that's not particularly fashionable, but I'm OK to stand on that pill.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:42):**  Yeah, I think you'll find plenty of people on your side on that one.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:47):**  But with the dilution of stories and the commercialization of these expressions, how can we make our  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:52):**  stories connect with others and break through the noise?  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:09:55):**  I think a lot of there's so many there's so many tips and trades, you know, potholes and  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:02):**  all the rest and mistakes.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:04):**  I've done them all.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:05):**  Like I always like to define wisdom as I know I know a lot about what doesn't work.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:10):**  Right.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:11):**  And the biggest thing that comes to mind to me immediately in the irony is it's not really  
**[0:10:16-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:16):**  so much of a mindset is to believe in the story you're about to share.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:24):**  And we and we don't have to be particularly sophisticated listeners or readers to really  
**[0:10:29-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:29):**  be able to know when someone is speaking, whether they are trying to sell us crap or  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:38):**  they give a crap.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:39):**  Right.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:40):**  And that's very much the reptilian brain.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:41):**  Does this person care about me or is this person just trying to free money from my wallet  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:47):**  right out of my bank machine?  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:48):**  And our spidey senses now are so strong to be yes.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:52):**  Right.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:53):**  We're inundated and we're exhausted.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:10:55):**  And and we're you know, we're we're walking around with COVID COVID curves and lockdown  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:02):**  life and all the rest.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:03):**  Like we have a really low tolerance for, you know, what our grandparents would have called,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:07):**  you know, horseshit.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:08):**  How's that?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:09):**  But so the mindset number one would be to actually believe in what you're going to say,  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:14):**  because that's actually fuel.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:16):**  Because if you're really hesitant and don't believe in your own story, then how the heck  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:20):**  or is anyone else going to believe in it as well?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:23):**  And especially as a public speaker, it's the Wild West up on stage.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:27):**  Like you cannot fake that stuff.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:31):**  And if you can, well, you're a superb actor, then you're not you're no longer in the realm  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:35):**  of storytelling for the sake of transformation and pushing the species forward.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:41):**  And I mean, I know that's that's the realm that you live in.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:44):**  Those are that's your tribe.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:46):**  So the first thing I would be is to really believe in the story that you're about to  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:50):**  share.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:51):**  And then once you have the power of belief, you're willing to sacrifice, you're willing  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:55):**  to stumble.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:11:56):**  But your authenticity and your strength and your courage is ultimately what people, whether  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:00):**  they're listeners or readers or both, will fall in love with it or at minimum, at least  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:05):**  give you a chance.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:08):**  Because stories as well, and that ties in with what's a good one, a story is ultimately  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:12):**  a form of influence.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:14):**  And it's an if and if that sounds too douchey or too marketing, a story is ultimately an  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:20):**  invitation into a better world.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:23):**  And then it's up to that person who's listening or reading to make a decision.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:27):**  It's ultimately what journalism was about.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:29):**  It's like, hey, Oliver, I know you're busy and you have a mortgage to pay.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:32):**  I know you have some yard waste to get rid of to walk the dog, maybe raise your kin.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:36):**  But this is what's happening in the world.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:39):**  And now it's up to you to decide whether or not that has any meaning for you.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:44):**  I know that makes like media consumption and media creation so easy and wonderful.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:49):**  But that really is the invitation is what does this story mean to you?  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:54):**  And if it does mean something to you, are you actually going to take action?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:12:59):**  And then true transformational storytellers such as yourself, what is really lovely is  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:04):**  the person in a moment of inspiration.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:07):**  They're actually you've appealed to their higher angel, shall we say their higher self.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:11):**  You then actually do have to offer them what the next step is.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:18):**  And I know that with some storytellers, that would sound like, well, then you're now advocating  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:22):**  for marketing.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:23):**  But it's wonderful to have to inspire people and to entertain them and to make them feel  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:29):**  good.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:30):**  It's wonderful.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:31):**  And then what's next?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:33):**  Because otherwise, a story is like eating cotton candy.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:36):**  It's fantastic.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:37):**  It's great.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:38):**  But in the end, you've added to your COVID curves, and nothing's changed.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:44):**  And as storytellers willing to really go up there and sacrifice and also stumble and suffer,  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:52):**  we really do have to then at least provide the next step of that inspiration.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:13:58):**  So that person can say, you know what, I love what Oliver just said, I agree with it, I'm  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:02):**  behind it.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:03):**  And then I've also taken action, and then it's done.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:09):**  And that's a highly satisfying interaction between two people, whether that's you in  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:15):**  front of a room of 300 people, like in the olden days, you know, a screen of 300 little  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:20):**  potato heads on a zoom call, or speaking to your boyfriend or girlfriend one on one, right,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:27):**  you're actually made an invitation, the person has accepted the invitation, and then you've  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:32):**  actually guided them through their own self-determined, you know, their self determination, their own  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:37):**  empowerment to actually do something that pushes a species forward.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:41):**  And that, my friend, is the good day at the office.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:45):**  Given just how sensitive listeners are about being advertised to, or for sniffing out any  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:50):**  selfish agenda, I count myself in that group now, how can we advance an agenda or effectively  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:14:57):**  make a point through storytelling without it coming off as sleazy or manipulative?  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:01):**  Well, I work with storytellers who ultimately have what would be called tough stories, right?  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:07):**  So they're tough stories in the sense that they can make people uncomfortable.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:11):**  And you can make people feel uncomfortable as soon as you push or not, or ring the doorbell  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:16):**  on their on whatever paradigm they're living in, right?  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:20):**  Because the only reason why people like us approach other people, as wonderfully, you  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:25):**  know, gorgeous and social as we are, is because we believe that we actually have something  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:30):**  to say that could make life a little bit better.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:33):**  And not in an egomaniacal way, but we, right?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:36):**  And this isn't all the time, obviously, but we have an idea and we believe in the idea  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:40):**  and we think it's going to make life better, right?  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:42):**  We're not selling porn or nicotine.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:44):**  Yes, I've said that from stage, you know, in the olden days, but it's true.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:47):**  Like, there's not, we don't have an ethical dilemma.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:49):**  Like the idea, you know, it's, the idea is, is good and it's pure and we believe in it  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:55):**  and it's not doing any harm.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:15:59):**  So, what can happen though is, is you do have to meet your audience and remember an audience  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:06):**  is ultimately a group of individuals, right?  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:08):**  So let's say instead of audience, I'm going to say individual, you do have to meet the  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:12):**  person with where they are.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:14):**  So as a skillset, how do you actually then, as you say, spoon feed or otherwise known  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:20):**  as kind of dumb it down.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:22):**  And then now we're talking down to people and we all love to be talked down to, of course,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:27):**  right?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:28):**  Why wouldn't you put on the brakes, right?  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:30):**  But that also doesn't work because then you're in the position of teacher and they are student,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:35):**  which means we're right and they're wrong.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:38):**  We're smart and they're dumb.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:39):**  Do you see?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:40):**  And that's the joys of the left brain, right?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:43):**  I'm right, you're wrong.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:46):**  And off to the races we go.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:48):**  So the biggest thing as a, as a skillset is I think of number one, grounding your story  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:54):**  in what's familiar to the average person you're speaking to.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:16:59):**  Let them know where they are.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:03):**  Let them recognize the world that you're talking about.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:05):**  Like something as simple as, which of course isn't really as simple as the word regeneration.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:10):**  If someone doesn't know what that actually means or what it's similar to, they can't  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:17):**  move forward.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:18):**  They like neurologically cannot move forward because they have an unanswered question.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:22):**  And the fact that they even on some level know that they have an unanswered question  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:27):**  is fantastic because it means they're actually doing some light lifting of, of critical thinking.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:33):**  Imagine that, right?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:36):**  So to really ground your, your story and what is familiar.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:40):**  And if we went even more skillset ground, your opening scene, think, think of film,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:46):**  right?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:47):**  Think of the best movies, the best stories, you know, I call it W3, you know, who's in  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:52):**  this frame, you know, where, where it is and you know, what's happening.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:17:58):**  So when I used to write for magazines, I remember one of the most powerful stories I had the  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:04):**  privilege of sharing was the character.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:06):**  She was pregnant.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:07):**  She was at a bus stop and she was waiting to get on the bus to go see the doctor.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:13):**  You know, who's there, you know, what's happening.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:16):**  And then the hint is within an hour of being at the doctor, she'll be fighting for her  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:20):**  life.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:21):**  You want to know what happens next?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:23):**  Right?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:24):**  And that starts at a bus stop.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:27):**  And so, so something as simple as that, but as you know, like simplicity is, is anything  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:34):**  but simplicity because it's essence.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:37):**  So that's what I would say is, is in terms of rather than thinking of spoonfeeding, if  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:42):**  you wanted to think in that term, think of familiarity.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:46):**  How can I show my listener who is giving me the most precious commodity on the planet,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:54):**  which is their time, they are never going to get that back.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:18:58):**  How can I have them know where they are, know what I'm talking about.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:05):**  And at the same time, it is again, the joys of the art and science of it and feel safe  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:11):**  at the same time.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:12):**  And having someone feel safe is to know where they are.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:16):**  They're not in a dark room, but bumbling around in the dark.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:19):**  That's our job, right?  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:21):**  As artists and communicators is to do that, preferably not live, but of course it's going  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:25):**  to happen live as well.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:26):**  It's how we learn.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:28):**  But then also to really trust you as a guide where it's like Oliver is here to guide me.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:35):**  He's not talking down to me and he wants to show me something just like when we were kids.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:40):**  And then I'm going to decide whether or not what Oliver is showing me is cool or not.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:46):**  And it becomes very non adversarial and there's not a winner or a loser, but of course, you  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:52):**  know what the stakes are is that the more people who come over onto your boat, the better.  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:58):**  I like that.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:19:59):**  I don't think I had thought of storytelling that way before as like a method of persuasion  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:04):**  of ideas and perspectives in hopes of connecting others to our ways of seeing the world or  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:09):**  showing that we're not alone in our feelings.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:13):**  And that's where the power of, I always like to say emotion is the potion, right?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:17):**  And I know that a lot of, um, a lot of people get a little squirrely about that because  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:22):**  they're like, that still sounds like manipulation and you sound like a marketer, but what do  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:26):**  we all have in common is that we're all emotional creatures and emotion doesn't undermine reason.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:32):**  Emotion is the foundation of reason.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:34):**  So one of the things to go back to say, helping, uh, people tell tough stories.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:39):**  I work a lot in the, um, recovery movement.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:43):**  So people who have been, uh, addicted to X, Y, and Z, and now they're living these beautiful  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:48):**  lives of recovery and, and they're, I call them lighthouses, they're beacons, right?  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:53):**  They ha and they have a story that is rooted in a lot of pain and suffering and so forth.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:20:58):**  And then it's also rooted in hope because here you have people who are not professional  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:02):**  speakers.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:03):**  They're not getting paid to speak, but they're, they're the most courageous people I've ever  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:07):**  met because they're willing to step up on that stage and, and share their story because  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:13):**  there might be one person who actually, uh, is changed, who they actually save from.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:20):**  And that's the highest stakes in storytelling.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:22):**  It's life or death.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:24):**  So with emotion so often, especially as, um, as men and especially as women, because we  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:30):**  have our own burdens is don't get too emotional.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:34):**  And then to, of course, our men, it's like, don't you like you, it's not, it's unspoken.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:38):**  Of course, you're not going to go up there and get choked up or anything like that.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:42):**  And I don't agree that women really should be doing that either as women.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:45):**  I think we're encouraged to lead with our wound stories.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:49):**  And I think it, I think it undermines of just about everybody.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:21:55):**  So what with emotion is one, one tip that I would, I would, uh, share with, with storytellers  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:01):**  as, as they're crafting their it's true, their pitches, their fundraising proposals is what  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:06):**  feel, what feelings do you actually want to activate in, in your, um, prospect.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:13):**  Now if you're getting the spidey senses of like, Oh, that sounds like marketing, but  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:17):**  it's true though.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:18):**  Like, do you, do you actually want to make them feel so horrible about the environment  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:23):**  that they better like, you know, they better save the whales cause all the whales are being  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:26):**  slaughtered or the seals are being, are, are, are being clubbed to death.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:30):**  Like we know that that doesn't, doesn't work.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:33):**  Like hope and faith builds, uh, builds worlds, not, not shame and fear.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:39):**  And those aren't the world, that's not the world we want to build.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:42):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:43):**  I'm exhausted from so many doomsday statistics and those dire warnings of the future for  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:49):**  humanity.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:50):**  And it's not that I disbelieve them or I don't want to hear it.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:53):**  It's just that it really only serves to paralyze me and I kind of fall into despair after hearing  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:22:58):**  certain amount of it.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:00):**  It seems to provoke apathy more than action for me and a lot of others.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:04):**  And at times it feels like that angle is being overplayed for emotional reactions.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:08):**  Yet I also know that personal emotion and vulnerability are powerful tools to convey  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:13):**  important and difficult messages.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:15):**  Do you have some tips on how to use them effectively without overdoing it?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:19):**  Oh, can it be, well, we, I think we've all seen it overplayed, right?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:22):**  I think we've all, yeah, we've all seen it to where it's like, oh, you might be crying,  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:26):**  but I don't believe you.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:27):**  Uh, well, vulnerability, I always think, you know, the power of honorability, Brené Brown,  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:31):**  you know, you're, you know, years ago.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:34):**  And, and I remember when she came out and she was so horrified because there she was  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:37):**  as a, as a researcher being called a storyteller.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:40):**  And that's why I think that became the boom, right?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:42):**  Cause that was like the number one, Ted talk and all the rest.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:46):**  And what did she have?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:47):**  I mean, it was, it was, she, she was vulnerable because she, she went behind the numbers,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:52):**  right?  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:53):**  She talked about, um, she talked about looking at the numbers and the power of shame, but  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:23:58):**  more than anything, that vulnerability, that, that origin story really went into the collective  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:05):**  consciousness because she was a researcher.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:07):**  So despite her Southern drawl y'all, you know, from Texas and, and, and blonde and, and,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:13):**  and, and, and pretty, right?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:15):**  The whole nine yards are all kinds of buttons being pushed here was this researcher, this  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:20):**  quantitate, I think, God, I don't even know what, how to pronounce it.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:24):**  Quantitative researcher who was talking about having a breakdown because it was all about  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:29):**  shame.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:30):**  So that's, so that's a form of vulnerability defined as there was a twist in the story,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:36):**  right?  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:37):**  And we love twists now, vulnerability though, I think, especially for, for some people,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:44):**  whether, whether male or female, but I believe guys have it a lot harder.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:47):**  It's like, why would I want to go up on stage and be vulnerable?  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:53):**  Like I want to be strong and professional and, and this like, and, and, and articulate  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:24:59):**  and, and as a woman too, it's like, why do I want to go up there and be vulnerable?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:03):**  But so I don't appear as, as a, as aggressive or assertive or a bitch, like, so, right.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:07):**  So we're already into a pothole.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:10):**  So I really define vulnerability as being in command and being in command of and being  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:19):**  in command of the room.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:21):**  Now when I tell this to some clients, they just say, Oh my goodness, they just want to  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:25):**  scream out of the room because they think they they've hired a dictator.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:28):**  But when I say maybe they have, but I, I see control as a fist.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:34):**  And a thing about a control is that like a fist, well again, right, just look at the  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:37):**  imagery, right?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:38):**  The fist is, is, is it's closed and nothing comes in and nothing comes out and, and yet  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:43):**  it's in it's a fist.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:44):**  So it has it, but one finger gets loose and then another finger and another finger and  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:48):**  it's an open palm.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:50):**  But command, since we're just coming off of Easter, I kind of think of Jesus.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:55):**  No I'm not going to say and go out there and act like Jesus, but you know that the open  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:25:58):**  palms, not crucifixion, but you will have days like that, but the kind of open palms  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:03):**  where command is you have an openness, you're grounded.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:08):**  I know to the mindfulness people, you know, the meditative people, like you're, you're  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:11):**  rooted in the ground, you're rooted in your story and you have command over your emotions.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:17):**  Can you still access, I don't want to say tears, but can you still access, you know,  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:24):**  emotion in your throat?  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:25):**  Can you still take a pause because you're feeling a little overwhelmed, not from nerves,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:29):**  but by passion, by emotion, by memory.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:33):**  And you can, and you, you have command because you're safe in your story.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:40):**  And therefore the audience is safe in that story too.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:43):**  Because if there's one thing that I've learned from being on the public speaking circuit,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:48):**  is that 99, and I believe, I believe this before, but 99.9% of people want you to succeed.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:26:56):**  They don't want, they don't want you to go up there and die on stage.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:00):**  I've done it.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:01):**  People are very gracious, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're harshest on ourselves,  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:06):**  right?  
**[0:27:07-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:07):**  But if you go up there and you're overly emotional, your listeners will panic because they don't  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:15):**  want to watch a train wreck.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:18):**  You know, they, they don't, they don't want to see it.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:21):**  And it's also oversharing.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:23):**  And I know that I've sat in a group and I've seen someone overshare and as wonderful as  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:29):**  I am, I'm actually mildly irritated because I feel like I'm being manipulated.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:35):**  And as a woman looking at another woman, the sisterhood, I'm like, girlfriend, you're not  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:38):**  helping us at all.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:40):**  And if I see a guy up there, I'm like, dude, no, like this, this is not what it is.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:45):**  Like you don't need, no, you'd be in command.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:49):**  So that's what comes to mind for me is that if you're telling a story where you actually  
**[0:27:55-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:27:55):**  get so, and you know what it is when you're rolling, like you just, you're not who's in  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:03):**  charge and it's not really you, then you know that, that, that that's beyond vulnerability.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:09):**  But I define vulnerability as being in command of your emotions, of your story, of the room.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:17):**  And you're still very much coming from on, on a scent on an authentic place.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:23):**  And you're being honest because I bet you you've seen it too.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:27):**  And especially with, with the public speaking circuit, I was amazed where people would tell  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:33):**  stories that they claimed were first person stories and they weren't.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:40):**  Have you seen like that?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:41):**  Like, like, yeah, like, it's like our story went over really well with a speaker.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:45):**  And then the next thing, you know, a couple of months later you hear a speaker and it's  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:47):**  like, Oh, that, what?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:48):**  That wasn't your father.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:49):**  That was my fault.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:50):**  You know?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:52):**  So it is, is to be honest, honest, honest, because if you're telling stories, especially  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:28:57):**  that include other people and whether they're there in another country or, or in another  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:03):**  world, I always put this, especially dead people.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:07):**  I always put them right in the room with me because you have to tell, you have to tell  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:12):**  the truth.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:13):**  And this is according to you, yes, and never let the facts get in the way of a good story.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:17):**  My dad always used to say, but at the same time, you have to really part of being in  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:24):**  command and being vulnerable is to know, I don't like the term bulletproof, but to know  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:29):**  that you're still in integrity.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:33):**  Because I think that's where we get into trouble.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:35):**  Trouble is when we, we know we're walking the line and then we lose courage.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:41):**  And that's actually our guidance system saying like, I know you have a big vision here, but  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:46):**  you have, but you still have to tell the truth.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:48):**  You still have to tell, yeah, it's, it's, it's not theatrics.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:53):**  There you have it.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:54):**  Some great advice for your stories and unique messages moving forward.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:29:58):**  There's a lot more ground that Shannon and I covered in the far reaching conversation  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:02):**  that you can find in the full Uncut Interview on the Regenerative Skills Patreon page.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:07):**  And you can find more of Shannon's work where?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:09):**  I run a storytelling studio here in Toronto, Canada.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:14):**  So I'm at lighthousestorytelling.com.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:17):**  And that's one of the many reasons why I call so many storytellers lighthouses, right?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:21):**  Where you don't see bunches, you don't see a bunch of lighthouses together or a flock  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:26):**  of lighthouses.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:27):**  You see them on cold, jagged, wet, slippery rock, just shining away.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:32):**  But every once in a while, it sure is nice to find other, other fellow lights.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:37):**  And I'm out there on LinkedIn with my own name.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:40):**  And then of course, on the website, there is the storytelling tips that come out.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:45):**  But no, I, I always appreciate speaking to lovely people like you, Oliver.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:51):**  And that would be my last closing tip for, for those of us.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:55):**  And I consider myself so blessed to even be in that realm.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:30:59):**  But to, to people like you who really see a better world, and then you actually have  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:07):**  the how to, like you actually have thought it through, through blood, sweat, and tears,  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:12):**  and then you've practiced it and you've experimented with it and you've perfected it.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:16):**  And now you want to share it with, with people rather than saying the world, but that's ultimately,  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:22):**  you know, one person at a time.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:24):**  It's it's really the, it's really the point of being alive.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:28):**  And I think sometimes as storytellers, we have to really remind ourselves that they're  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:32):**  really, this is the work with a capital W and it's blood, sweat, and tears.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:39):**  But at the same time, there's such a tremendous joy in sharing your ideas through story.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:47):**  And it's a sacred art and you're transformed.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:50):**  And then we, as listeners or readers were transformed as well.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:31:55):**  And as I like to say, and of course, Leonard Cohen said it best, that's, that's how, that's  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:00):**  how the light gets in, right?  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:02):**  It's through the cracks.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:03):**  So I really salute you and to your listeners as well for the hard work that they're doing.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:09):**  And at the same time that it's the work, it's the whole point of being here.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:14):**  All right, before wrapping up today, I want to pose some questions to you directly.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:21):**  What stories have really connected with you throughout your life?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:24):**  Have they changed your mind or shaped your worldview in meaningful ways?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:28):**  And do you think you would be able to retell that story to another person and have it make  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:32):**  the same impact on them as it did for you?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:35):**  If not, what skills would it require to make that happen?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-tell-better-stories/#t=0:32:39):**  As always, we'll be exploring these questions and sharing stories on the Discord channel.

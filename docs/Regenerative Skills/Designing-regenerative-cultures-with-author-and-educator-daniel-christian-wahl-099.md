**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:02:15):**  decided to focus on sustainability and sustainable communities.

**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:06):**  perspective and experience on community and cultural shifts, the factors of time in nuanced  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:12):**  design, working in collaboration on multi-stakeholder projects and much more.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:17):**  This interview is the perfect capstone for this last month's focus on design theory and  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:21):**  regenerative community dynamics.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:23):**  So before I give it all away, I'll hand it over now to Daniel.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:27):**  Hey Daniel, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:31):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:32):**  Very well, thanks for inviting me.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:34):**  It's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:35):**  How's the weather in Majorca?  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:36):**  I would imagine your winters are pretty mild there.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:39):**  Mild, but you get spoiled and then when it's a windy and not sunny day, you're on the edge  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:46):**  of complaining, but yeah, no, we are spoiled.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:48):**  It's a windy day today and normally I go stand up paddling every day and today it was just  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:52):**  a bit too cold and choppy.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:54):**  Ah, okay.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:55):**  Yeah, no, we're spoiled here too.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:03:58):**  The wintertime is our dry sunny season.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:01):**  It's kind of the height of the tourist season, so I'm completely spoiled as well.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:04):**  I know how it is.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:05):**  So look, I've got a ton of questions to ask you and I've been really inspired by a lot  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:09):**  of your work, your talks and some of the articles you've written to say nothing of the book.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:12):**  So what do you say we just jump right into the questions?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:15):**  Sounds good to me.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:16):**  All right, so could you talk a little bit first about how you began to pursue regenerative  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:20):**  design and who were some of the mentors who've guided you along your journey?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:26):**  I try to make this a relatively short version, but basically, initially I studied biology  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:33):**  and really out of a motivation, a bit like the natural philosophers like Humboldt or  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:40):**  Goethe were just curious about how life works.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:45):**  Then there came a point in that career where I realized that I could spend my entire time,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:51):**  my entire life studying whales and dolphins and most likely they would go extinct within  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:04:57):**  my children's lifetime and they would only know the amount of books.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:01):**  So I kind of at that point decided to work with my species in order to help other species.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:10):**  And to speed it up a bit, I ended up doing a masters in holistic science at Schumacher  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:16):**  College where I met John Todd and Nancy Jack Todd and David Ohr and they really turned  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:23):**  me on to the power of design as the way that we can remake the human presence on earth  
**[0:05:29-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:29):**  and hopefully make it a healing one in terms of undoing the damage that we've been doing  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:38):**  to the biosphere for many, many years.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:41):**  And at the time I was still working under the heading of ecological design, but pretty  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:47):**  much with the same intentions of healing and regeneration.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:51):**  And I ended up doing a PhD with a wonderful man called Professor Seton Baxter at the University  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:56):**  of Dundee.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:05:57):**  He had a little post-graduate research unit called the Center for the Study of Natural  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:02):**  Design.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:04):**  And my 2006 PhD thesis was on design for human and planetary health, a holistic integral  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:10):**  approach to complexity and sustainability.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:13):**  And while I wasn't really using the word regenerative back then, it really is, to my mind, an early  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:22):**  work on regenerative design and planetary health.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:26):**  And then over the 10, 15 years that came afterwards, I've been working with the United Nations  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:32):**  Institute of Training and Research and with Global Eco-Village Network and Gaia Education  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:37):**  and Bioneers and the International Futures Forum and lots of different outfits that basically  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:44):**  care about the future and try to create a more viable, thriving future for this generation,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:51):**  but also the generations yet to come.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:06:55):**  And in 2016, I wrote my book, Designing Regenerative Cultures.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:00):**  And it's around that time, a couple of years before that, that I came across Bill Reed  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:04):**  and Pamela Mang and the work of the Regenesis Group.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:07):**  And when I first saw that graphic that is also in my book, it shows that spectrum from  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:13):**  business as usual to green to sustainable to restorative and then onto regenerative,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:18):**  it was like a light went on and I kind of said, ah, now it all makes sense.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:23):**  And also having had a lot of contact with people in the regenerative agriculture movement,  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:30):**  particularly.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:31):**  It just seemed to me back then and when I wrote my book, 2014, 2015, that regenerative  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:38):**  was the meme that was so much more powerful than the word sustainability.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:44):**  And in many ways, I've been proven right because since my book came out, it seems like everything  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:52):**  has gone like in so many different areas, people are working on regenerative economics,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:07:57):**  regenerative bioregional development, generative design and so on.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:01):**  And I have high hopes that this is the beginning of what I call the regeneration rising, the  
**[0:08:07-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:07):**  last minute transformative response of humanity to the crisis we're facing and the last chance  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:16):**  to create a viable future for our species on this planet.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:21):**  That's a wonderful explanation.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:23):**  And what it prompts me to ask now is what is your own personal definition of regenerative  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:28):**  design?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:29):**  Because I recently got Bill Reed from Regenesis Group's definition on that, and that was very  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:34):**  eye opening for me as well.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:36):**  And what is the difference between that and sustainability to you?  
**[0:08:40-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:40):**  Well, I would say, and I mean, I work with Bill, I like Bill a lot and I think we overall  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:50):**  ideologically agree completely, but when it comes down to sort of use of language and  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:55):**  so sometimes we might use different wordings.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:08:59):**  But for me, there are lots of people, and this really has to be stressed, there are  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:03):**  lots of people who've been working in the field of sustainability from a regenerative  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:09):**  stance and with a regenerative, salutogenic intention.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:15):**  But in the way that Bill likes to describe it, and I think it's useful, to basically  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:24):**  say that sustainable is the point at which we don't add any more damage to the system,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:29):**  where what we're doing right now is not degrading the resource base and not damaging ecosystems  
**[0:09:38-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:38):**  or eroding social fabric or destroying local economies.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:48):**  But since we've done so much damage in all these areas over the last 50, 250, with the  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:54):**  start of agriculture, even 5,000 years, not doing any more damage isn't enough.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:09:59):**  We need to undo the damage that we have done over all those centuries.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:10:05):**  And that moves you then into restorative practice, but restorative practice, when done with the  
**[0:10:11-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:10:11):**  hubris of a kind of human engineer coming in and redesigning entire ecosystems on a  
**[0:10:19-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:10:19):**  GIS system and then implementing that design, it can still be done in a mindset that is  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:10:31):**  separating humanity and nature, and only when we put humanity really back into the system  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:10:36):**  and understand that as biological beings we're fundamentally interconnected with the wider  
**[0:10:41-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:10:41):**  community of life upon which we depend for our survival, then we begin to, rather than  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:10:49):**  design learning from nature, we begin to try to design as nature, and that is both enormously  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:10:55):**  humbling and somewhat audacious, because what we really have to do is to redesign the human  
**[0:11:01-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:01):**  presence on Earth in time to reverse climate change within this century and restore healthy  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:09):**  ecosystems functions over the next three decades.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:12):**  And so as a definition of what I call a regenerative culture, it's a culture that tries, wherever  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:24):**  possible, to increase the capacity of the people within it to respond to an uncertain  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:29):**  future in ways that are adaptive to the changes that will come at us and to do so in ways  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:37):**  that are restoring and regenerating the healthy ecosystems functions of the ecosystems upon  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:43):**  which we depend, but also restoring and regenerating the social fabric and social cohesion of our  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:50):**  communities so we are able to collaborate more effectively in responding to these changes.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:11:57):**  So it's all about capacity to respond, it's about manifesting our potential to be a healing  
**[0:12:07-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:07):**  and regenerating impact on the environments in which we live and upon which we depend.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:15):**  As a marvelous answer, and I want to unpack some of those very complex things that you  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:21):**  breezed over there, let's start with the idea of designing nature as nature rather than  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:28):**  apart from it.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:30):**  What sort of mindset shift does that require and what perspective needs to be cultivated  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:35):**  in order for us to think as a part of the systems that we're designing?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:40):**  Well the reality is that we've never been anything but nature.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:47):**  The quickest way to find out if that statement is true is to invite you to not breathe for  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:52):**  the next nine minutes and if you're still there at the end of that then I'd be surprised  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:12:57):**  because you're a biological being with a metabolism depending on oxygen and food and all sorts  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:04):**  of things that are moving through your system.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:07):**  And so as being primarily biological beings, we have somehow over the last, particularly  
**[0:13:18-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:18):**  since the Scientific Revolution but even before that, have started to tell a story that has  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:26):**  believed that culture somehow emancipated itself from the modern human world and that  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:31):**  it is now somewhat separate from nature and we speak of nature as other.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:37):**  And that's why I deeply respect the wonderful work that Janine Benioz and all the people  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:42):**  working in the biomimicry field are doing and I actually helped together with a group  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:47):**  of colleagues here in Spain and Portugal to launch the Iberian Network for Biomimicry.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:53):**  But what I've noticed is that in the language use there's still this intent to let's learn  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:13:59):**  from nature and copy it to adapt it to our human designs and I think we have to be really  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:04):**  careful of this kind of language use because it perpetuates this false dualism.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:11):**  And once we really truly understand ourselves as parts of the ecosystem or participants  
**[0:14:18-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:18):**  in the ecosystems that surround us and participants within this transforming process that is the  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:28):**  biosphere that is life as a planetary process, then we will design in a completely different  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:34):**  way because we will stop designing in these kind of siloed ways of just looking at product  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:40):**  design because we actually need to, or architecture, or the different scales of design.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:46):**  Because everything is interconnected in this transforming complex dynamic system that we  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:52):**  participate in, we need to always pay attention to all the scales that whatever design we're  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:14:59):**  working on sits in.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:01):**  So when you work at the scale of product design you need to ask yourself how does this product  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:06):**  sit in a building.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:08):**  And so for example if you have a passive house, wonderful eco-building with all eco-materials  
**[0:15:19-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:19):**  and no off-gassing, if you then fill it with products that are made from toxic plastics  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:27):**  and are off-gassing these into the environment, then you still have health effects.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:32):**  So it's this idea that really paying attention to the complexity that we're facing and stopping  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:40):**  this short-sighted piecemeal approach that most designers still have today.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:47):**  And with all of that challenge of complexity in the world that we live in and the choices  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:52):**  that we have to constantly confront, how do we start to educate not only this generation  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:15:59):**  but the younger generation to think in these levels of complexity or to simple it so that  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:04):**  you can make more informed decisions on a day-to-day basis?  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:09):**  That's the million dollar question.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:11):**  I think education is key.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:15):**  Sometimes it can feel like education is too slow, but education has the potential of shifting  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:23):**  the worldview and the value system that drives ultimately what our intentions, what our real  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:29):**  and perceived needs are and therefore drives our behavior and how we design, what we design  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:35):**  and all that.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:37):**  So the highest leverage point of interfering in a system is at that level of shifting worldviews  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:45):**  and value systems or even inviting people into being able to hold multiple perspectives  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:51):**  at the same time, even if they seem somewhat contradictory, and let themselves be informed  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:57):**  by these multiple perspectives.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:16:59):**  Because one of the stories we've got at the moment is that if I'm right and you have a  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:05):**  different opinion, you must be wrong.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:07):**  And that might in this complexity not be true.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:11):**  Really we need to look at our participation in this process from a number of angles and  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:19):**  be informed by different ways of knowing.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:24):**  Can you repeat your question again because I think I sort of veered off a little bit.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:28):**  No, no, that's fine.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:29):**  We were just talking about how you might be able to educate other generations to think  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:33):**  through the complexity of these things when it really hasn't been focused on in most countries'  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:38):**  educational systems.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:39):**  I can't speak to all of them.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:41):**  But some examples that come to mind is Gunther Pauli, the author of The Blue Economy and  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:49):**  founder of the Zero Emissions Research Initiative.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:52):**  He quite a few years ago, maybe 10, 12 years ago, wrote a series of fables which are called  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:58):**  Gunther's Fables.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:17:59):**  And they basically are all about environmental ethics, dynamic systems thinking, the interconnectedness  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:07):**  of ecosystems.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:09):**  And they're all written in simple language, five-minute fables that you can read to your  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:15):**  children at bedtime.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:17):**  And they come with a little study guide so you can use these fables at different ages  
**[0:18:23-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:23):**  and every time you repeat them to your children they have another dimension or another level,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:31):**  a layer of depth to teach this kind of ecological systems view of life.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:38):**  So that would be one thing.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:39):**  Then Linda Booth Sweeney, who wrote this wonderful book which any teacher or facilitator should  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:45):**  have a look at, called The Systems Thinking Playbook, has in recent years also started  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:51):**  to write children's stories.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:53):**  And I think we need much more of that.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:18:55):**  And for me that's a topic close to home because I've become a father 18 months ago and now  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:01):**  that I look into my 18-month-old daughter's eyes I really wonder what kind of education  
**[0:19:08-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:08):**  system can I submit her to that she doesn't learn this separation from nature and that  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:19):**  she actually much more deeply feels her interconnectedness with the world at large.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:24):**  And of course it continues because education is lifelong learning.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:28):**  We need to get into the schools, we need to get into the universities.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:32):**  I've worked a lot with universities, I've designed master's programs for a number of  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:37):**  different universities, set up the world's first master's in sustainable community design  
**[0:19:43-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:43):**  with Harriet Watt University and Fintan College, a college based in an eco-village in Scotland.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:52):**  And then for the last, ever since 2007, I've been involved with Gaia Education and worked  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:19:57):**  with them off and on and for the last five years I've been working with them more closely,  
**[0:20:02-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:02):**  writing curriculum for them and they basically offer a number of different modalities, 125  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:10):**  hour residential course and 400 hour online courses and a number of other programs that  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:17):**  train people in design for sustainability or train people in sustainable community design.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:23):**  Now with this increased perspective of looking at the world as nature rather than apart from  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:28):**  it, let's talk a little bit about the community design that you've touched on, especially  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:33):**  this being the main subject of your book.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:36):**  How do we start to design communities that are in harmony with nature and actually work  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:41):**  to regenerate the systems in which they interact?  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:46):**  Little correction, my book's called Designing Regenerative Cultures and community is one  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:50):**  of those scales.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:51):**  Sorry, I made a mistake.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:52):**  No, no, that's okay.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:53):**  It's a very important scale but it kind of prompts me to say that I actually spent 10,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:20:59):**  12 years very much focused on the community scale.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:03):**  As I mentioned before, working with the Global Eco-Village Network, working with Gaia Education  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:08):**  which is an educational charity that grew out of the Global Eco-Village Network and  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:13):**  runs a course called Eco-Village Design Education.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:18):**  So I was very focused on how do we put the pieces of the puzzle of sustainability and  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:24):**  regenerative development into place at the scale of a community.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:30):**  What I actually realized doing that and also being quite involved with the first wave of  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:36):**  the transition town movement, helping to set up transition town in forests in Scotland  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:41):**  and giving talks in Germany about transition town when nobody else was doing that yet,  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:47):**  I kind of realized that at the scale of communities, on the one hand, that's where people have  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:52):**  a face, that's where they have the story that connects them to their place and to the history  
**[0:21:57-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:21:57):**  of that place and is a key scale at which we actualize patterns of sustainable regenerative  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:07):**  behavior.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:08):**  But it's not enough in terms of from a whole systems design perspective to really integrate  
**[0:22:15-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:15):**  all the needs of the human population in a benign way into the ecosystems they inhabit.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:23):**  You really need collaboration between multiple communities at the bi-regional scale.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:28):**  I think that the scale of the region is the scale at which we can redesign the human impact  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:37):**  on Earth to not be based on artificial borders that were drawn by a ruler of some kind of  
**[0:22:44-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:44):**  empire or colonialist, but we actually draw the borders again based on aquifers and watersheds  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:54):**  and natural patterns.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:22:56):**  And that's really what the promise of the bi-regional design development approach is,  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:05):**  which is not to diminish the importance of community design.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:11):**  So within those types of shifts of structures, how can we start to collaborate at a much  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:17):**  more advanced level, especially on sort of multi-stakeholder projects?  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:21):**  And I'm asking this from a personal perspective, as I happen to be as a part of a company and  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:27):**  a group that's working on land-based projects here in Guatemala.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:31):**  I just didn't realize when getting into it how complex and difficult the interpersonal  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:38):**  relationships and coming to consensus and all of these other essential parts of collaboration  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:44):**  were.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:45):**  And having studied these through the Eco-Village Network and the communities that you've been  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:50):**  a part of, what have been some of the insights or the advice that you would give someone  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:55):**  going into a multi-stakeholder project?  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:23:59):**  Be patient.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:00):**  Go for it in the long run.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:06):**  The path is the goal.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:09):**  If you have a clear idea of where you want to be in two years' time, you're most likely  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:15):**  going to get really frustrated.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:16):**  You're absolutely right.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:17):**  It's a really tricky process.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:20):**  It's much easier when you work at the scale of an intentional community in Eco-Village  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:24):**  where it's still very complex, but at least you've got a whole bunch of people who say,  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:28):**  we want to live in a different way and we want to create a sustainable system.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:32):**  Let's try to do that together.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:33):**  And then the problems start.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:35):**  But when you're in the real world and you work with, like I have done for the last eight  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:39):**  years here on the island of Majorca, I actually moved to Majorca because at least there's  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:43):**  one positive thing about islands as models for bioregions.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:47):**  You can't have an argument about the borders of the bioregion.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:51):**  They're defined by the water, by the beach.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:55):**  But I completely agree with you.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:24:58):**  It is so complex and you basically deal with the clash of worldviews.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:03):**  You deal with people who are mainly in the mindset that whatever the amount of money  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:10):**  you've made in your life is your measurement of performance, so you must be more intelligent,  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:16):**  more successful and better if you're wealthier.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:19):**  And of course, that's not always the case, or actually very rarely the case.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:25):**  And then working with universities, you run into the bureaucratic, like, why they should  
**[0:25:31-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:31):**  be the lighthouses for a bioregional culture of inspiration and data and information management  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:40):**  and knowledge provision.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:42):**  They're very often somewhat stuck ivory towers where any project that is inviting multi-stakeholder  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:49):**  collaboration can easily be seen as a challenge to established power structures in universities.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:25:56):**  And then local government, the same thing, you might be just about to make an inroad  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:02):**  with your local government on local and bioregional planning, and then suddenly there's a political  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:07):**  change and since we have these very short-term election cycles of four years, sometimes the  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:14):**  whole work that you've done with a stakeholder process over three, four years can be washed  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:20):**  down the drain when another party comes into power and says, well, they started that project,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:25):**  so let's stop it now.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:28):**  Just on principle, yeah.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:30):**  So not wanting to sound terribly frustrated and like a wet blanket on that, I still absolutely  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:37):**  believe we need these multi-stakeholder platforms.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:41):**  And for me, one way of working in that space is to invite everybody, not just one party  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:51):**  but all the parties, not just the universities but the universities and the schools and local  
**[0:26:56-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:26:56):**  NGOs, invite as diverse a group of representatives as possible to get involved in a future state  
**[0:27:04-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:04):**  visioning process that really asks where do we want to be in X amount of time in the future,  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:14):**  and then create that image as clear as possible and then start backcasting from that.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:20):**  And this is, for example, where the Regenesis approach would be slightly different from  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:24):**  mine.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:25):**  Regenesis is very focused, like Bill Reid and Pamela Mung and Ben Haggard, are very  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:32):**  much about drawing the story of place out of the location.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:36):**  And I think that's also hugely important and it can inform such a visioning process.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:41):**  But to me, it's a both-and, not neither-or.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:45):**  So in a similar way, as I would say, giving people a quick introduction to case studies  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:27:54):**  and first to the complex map of what needs to be integrated to create a whole systems  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:01):**  design that has a higher chance of being regenerative and sustainable helps.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:08):**  Because I find that basically if you make it only a process of drawing out of the local  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:13):**  population in place their story of place and their vision of place, what you will get is  
**[0:28:20-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:20):**  defined by the education and the cultural process of the last 30, 40 years in that place.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:29):**  And that might mean that people have never had the vision of that other ways of living  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:34):**  are possible.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:35):**  Some places are too disconnected from the indigenous wisdom of the past where people  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:40):**  still lived in place with the wisdom that came from that place and have basically been  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:46):**  eroded in terms of what they even hold possible.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:50):**  So for me, it's about education, it's about visioning, it's about carefully listening  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:28:57):**  to the story of place and weaving all of that together.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:01):**  Yeah, I could go on, but I'll leave it there.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:05):**  Certainly.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:06):**  And if I can kind of summarize this quickly, just almost from my own understanding, it's  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:13):**  hard to underestimate how necessary it is to find the narrative of a place when you  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:18):**  start any sort of project or initiative or even before you get to that stage by identifying  
**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:24):**  the stories and the identity that the people and the place sort of identify with and using  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:32):**  that as a way of unifying the collective, but also then stepping ahead and finding a  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:40):**  new narrative as to the full potential of what that collective can be and where it can  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:45):**  go and how it can interact with the system.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:48):**  And when those two things are identified and perhaps the agreeing party sort of come to  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:29:55):**  a consensus, you see that as the main way forward and getting people onto the same page  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:02):**  or same narrative or same goal in order to facilitate cooperation?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:08):**  Almost, yes.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:09):**  Although I'm not so sure about the word consensus.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:13):**  It's almost like that the most powerful thing you can do in a multi-stakeholder process  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:19):**  is to get people to a level of understanding of complexity and the unpredictability of  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:27):**  the big system they participate in that they begin to value the diversity of opinion.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:33):**  They begin to value disagreeing more intelligently.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:38):**  And if you can get an overall overarching consensus where you can say, this is the higher  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:47):**  ground where we can meet.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:48):**  We have different political opinions.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:49):**  We have different ways we tell the story of the past in some cases, particularly here  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:54):**  in Spain, that's very prevalent.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:30:58):**  But we actually share a common vision of the kind of world we would like our children to  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:04):**  grow up in.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:05):**  And we share an understanding of the urgency of the imminent climate chaos that we're now  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:12):**  running towards, that we know that we don't have an option anymore.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:17):**  We need to find ways to collaborate in all our diversity, with all our disagreements,  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:23):**  and find that higher ground of – and this is where I think regeneration is so powerful  
**[0:31:30-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:30):**  and positive, because anybody would understand that by regenerating the resource spaces and  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:40):**  the capacity of people in place, you can only increase your chances in a turbulent and uncertain  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:47):**  future.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:48):**  And even if we just get to that point, we're already beginning to move in the right direction.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:54):**  Hmm.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:55):**  I really agree with that.  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:58):**  That's a very good way of explaining it.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:31:59):**  And my next question kind of comes from some questions that I've begun to ask in my own  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:04):**  design process for our own projects and those for clients.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:08):**  And that is, what part of the problem am I?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:12):**  And to elaborate on that, it would be, especially in multi-stakeholder projects, what part of  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:18):**  the communication breakdown am I responsible for, and what responsibility for its facilitation  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:23):**  can I take on?  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:25):**  Because like you mentioned earlier, the complexity of all of these different personalities, power  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:31):**  structures, differences of opinion and ideology can be very difficult to navigate.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:38):**  So how can you make sure or take steps to ensure that you are not part of the problem  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:44):**  or that you are facilitating the communication and the cooperation of the parties involved?  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:51):**  Also a hugely important question.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:32:52):**  And it reminds me of a kind of saying that gets repeated a lot in the International Futures  
**[0:33:01-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:33:01):**  Forum, which goes that the quality and effectiveness of the intervention depends on the inner state  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:33:09):**  of being or quality of being of the intervener.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:33:14):**  And that's another way of saying that, again in the regenerative development language of  
**[0:33:20-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:33:20):**  the Genesis group, it would mean that the first level of work is working at your own  
**[0:33:29-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:33:29):**  personal development and working to be able to sit in the fire in these processes and  
**[0:33:36-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:33:36):**  to try to not get triggered, to try to be constantly aware of this observing your own  
**[0:33:45-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:33:45):**  locus of attention, your own way of making meaning and telling a story, so you can be  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:33:57):**  most transparent when you facilitate about where you might be bringing in a bias, because  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:04):**  you have an opinion too and you're part of that system, but at the same time giving space  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:10):**  for other people to voice their strong opinions as well.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:15):**  I think it's a lifelong process and I've seen these kinds of processes depend enormously  
**[0:34:23-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:23):**  on the quality of the facilitation that holds the process and the level of trust and buy-in  
**[0:34:32-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:32):**  from these different stakeholder groups towards the team that is convening.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:42):**  It's a tough job.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:44):**  I like to call it weaving or the role of the systems weaver.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:49):**  When you're a bridge builder or weaver bringing together these very diverse stakeholder groups,  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:34:55):**  you often find yourself using slightly, when you're only with one group, you use slightly  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:01):**  different language that is more akin to their language and their framing of the world, but  
**[0:35:08-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:08):**  you also try to make them understand the value in all the other constituents in the multi-stakeholder  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:16):**  system.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:17):**  To some extent, what that means is that you leave yourself open as the weaver and the  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:23):**  bridge builder and the meta-network weaver to be shot at from both sides of the bridge,  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:29):**  because it's very easy for anybody in different constituencies that are still in the habit  
**[0:35:35-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:35):**  of creating an other as opponents or being opposed to misidentify the bridge builder  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:45):**  or the weaver as just one from the other side of the bridge.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:50):**  It's an art form and it's a continued personal development process that never stops.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:56):**  Indeed, yeah.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:35:58):**  I find that one of the other aspects of design that we as humans tend, not always, but tend  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:04):**  to be kind of poor at is the element of time.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:09):**  So how can you think long term when designing?  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:13):**  How can you make accurate predictions of how a design and a community might evolve or in  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:18):**  some cases allow for space and flexibility in the design to take into account the unforeseen?  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:25):**  Yeah, when I speak of this motion of scale linking design, I mean both temporally and  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:32):**  spatially scale linking.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:34):**  So the spatial is to always be aware of how the scale of even green chemistry and the  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:42):**  materials we use, the scale of products, communities, architecture, industrial ecology, bioregional  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:48):**  planning and more international scales are all interlinked.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:52):**  And in a similar way, short cycles, mid-term cycles and long-term cycles in nature are  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:36:59):**  also fundamentally interlinked.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:01):**  The whole work of the Resilience Alliance and Stockholm Resilience Center, if you've  
**[0:37:06-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:06):**  ever seen this panarchy cycle and the adaptive loop, it's basically change processes sitting  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:14):**  within change processes.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:15):**  And the bigger the process is when they come at the level of ecosystems or entire biomes  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:22):**  or even the entire biosphere, these cycles run much slower.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:27):**  And the closer you get to the smaller the place gets of the local community or the bioregion,  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:33):**  it becomes a little faster.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:35):**  And so the long-term design approach is to just be aware of these changing, like the  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:44):**  different change dynamics at different scales interacting.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:48):**  But it's also being aware that our interventions will always be temporary and imperfect, that  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:57):**  we just keep having to adapt.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:37:59):**  One of the key insights at an early point of time trying to write my book was this moment  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:04):**  when I realized that, wait a minute, what can I actually put in this book that isn't  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:09):**  going to be obsolete in 10 or 20 years time?  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:12):**  And I began to realize that more often than not, yesterday's solutions have turned into  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:18):**  today's problems even if the solutions are offered with the best of intentions.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:24):**  So even you and I trying to do positive work at the bioregional scale in our communities,  
**[0:38:30-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:30):**  how can we be sure that what we're proposing isn't also somewhat biased and a limited perspective  
**[0:38:37-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:37):**  and will lead to unintended consequences in the future and therefore will require future  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:46):**  course corrections?  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:48):**  And I guess once we have that humility, we begin to pay more attention to asking the  
**[0:38:53-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:38:53):**  right questions and take answers as transitory means to get to better questions rather than  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:02):**  questions as transitory means to get to answers that are final.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:08):**  Because very few answers are final.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:10):**  And so basically just keep being adaptive is the short answer.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:15):**  Well, then tell me some of the questions that have helped you to gain perspective and start  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:21):**  to design in a way that is perhaps more compassionate and takes in the perspective of as many other  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:26):**  people and possibly even life forms as you can accommodate.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:31):**  Well, some of this, I mean, this is what we find.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:36):**  The more we go into exploring what are the questions that would create a regenerative  
**[0:39:41-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:41):**  culture, I think many of the questions are questions that humanity has asked for millennia  
**[0:39:49-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:49):**  when we were still living bioregionally in tribal communities that were often nomadic  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:39:57):**  and were moving through the landscape.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:00):**  And so this wonderful and somewhat overquoted question of the Iroquois Federation in North  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:08):**  America where they basically had this rule to ask themselves, how would our decision  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:14):**  today affect the seventh unborn generation of the future?  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:20):**  That's a powerful question.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:23):**  Or the question that I learned from the famous ecological design architect William McDonagh  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:30):**  at a conference in Barcelona by now 15 years ago.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:35):**  He asked the question of how can anything that creates ugliness and ill health and discomfort  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:43):**  to people elsewhere be truly beautiful?  
**[0:40:48-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:48):**  So this concept of total beauty, again, the Native American wisdom has this advice to  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:40:58):**  people as if you walk into the future, walk in beauty.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:04):**  Beauty is a wonderful feedback mechanism.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:08):**  A lot of boat designers I know say they never, Buckman Safuller said something similar, when  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:13):**  I design I never think about beauty, but when I'm finished with the design and it's not  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:18):**  beautiful I know that it's not right.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:20):**  Yeah, those are very good metrics to look at.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:23):**  You still there?  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:26):**  Yeah, still there.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:29):**  Okay.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:30):**  Sorry.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:31):**  I'm going to glitch a little bit with the internet connection.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:36):**  So within these terms of scale, let's talk a little bit about how you can plan at the  
**[0:41:41-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:41):**  stages of local, bioregional, and all the way up to global economies, especially when  
**[0:41:49-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:49):**  maybe not having direct access or reach to some of those larger scales.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:41:56):**  I love this word that has emerged over the last few years, glocal.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:03):**  I first came across it when I ran a consultancy research project for Ecovair here on Mallorca  
**[0:42:10-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:10):**  and we called it Ecovair Glocal, which was basically this idea of whether they could  
**[0:42:19-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:19):**  use waste streams on Mallorca to create detergents and cleaning products on Mallorca from waste  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:27):**  products and basically use them for the local market.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:33):**  In this particular case study we were positioning Ecovair as a knowledge holder that is global,  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:41):**  that is working in 40 countries around the world, that has 35 years of experience in  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:46):**  how to create ecological detergents, but then they would collaborate at the local level  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:51):**  with the local chemical industry to actually produce the products.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:42:57):**  And for me, because everything is interconnected, all our interventions at any scale do affect  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:05):**  the whole system.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:07):**  And the larger planetary response to the current climate crisis and the increasing uncertainties  
**[0:43:18-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:18):**  and increasing potential for disruptive processes at multiple scales from local to bioregional  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:27):**  invite us.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:28):**  It's actually one and the same response.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:31):**  If we try to prepare for climate chaos, we need to increase local resilience and shorten  
**[0:43:38-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:38):**  supply lines and create redundancy in the system, move towards renewable energy, decentralized  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:45):**  systems that are not so easily disrupted.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:50):**  If we do all that, and if we do it right, restoring local soils, local watersheds, reforesting  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:43:58):**  local forests, then we're actually affecting the planetary scale.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:03):**  So in many ways, working locally means to work locally and bioregionally in global collaboration  
**[0:44:12-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:12):**  and knowledge exchange and to trust in the pattern of emergence that if enough people  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:20):**  in enough places begin this local and bioregional regenerative development process, then what  
**[0:44:27-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:27):**  will emerge out of it is a diverse kaleidoscope of different bioregional regenerative cultures.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:38):**  And they'll be different because they'll be adapted to the biocultural uniqueness of the  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:43):**  places and the bioregions they inhabit, but this will be enabled by global collaboration  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:48):**  and solidarity.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:51):**  And I think that's the kind of maturation process that our species is now called to  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:44:57):**  make, that we have to understand that the time of them and us thinking is over, that  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:03):**  nation states are in anachronism that has no real place, certainly not in the 22nd century,  
**[0:45:09-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:09):**  that we need to become one species humbly united in creating conditions conducive to  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:16):**  life, and that we do so best at the bioregional scale, and that means open innovation, open  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:22):**  knowledge exchange, peer-to-peer collaboration, and all those things that are already being  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:27):**  developed.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:28):**  It means re-empowering a way of working with the global commons, deprivatizing a lot of  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:35):**  things that should have never been privatized, and all of that needs activism at local, bioregion,  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:42):**  national and international scale.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:44):**  It needs all of us and it needs work at all scales at one and the same time.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:53):**  That is very beautifully and articulately explained.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:55):**  I really appreciate that.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:45:58):**  Let's take a couple of steps back and before actually enacting some of these projects,  
**[0:46:04-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:04):**  it requires a lot of thinking and a lot of, like you said, humility too, before actually  
**[0:46:11-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:11):**  implementing or moving forward with these things.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:13):**  So my question would be, what are some of the essential design criteria that you research  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:18):**  before starting a project?  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:23):**  The one thing, I think it's an interesting question because now you're pushing me into  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:29):**  an area where there's a lot of tacit knowledge, but I have actually not necessarily made it  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:35):**  explicit under this kind of heading of design criteria.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:40):**  But basically, a lot of it has to do with mapping the opportunities and the challenges  
**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:54):**  of the place and the bioregion I work in.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:46:58):**  So it is the same process as Alla Regenesis of looking deeply into the story of place.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:09):**  Washington town had the same impulse of asking the elders, talking to people who know the  
**[0:47:15-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:15):**  longer climate patterns, which areas flood, how often the bigger cycles of droughts come  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:24):**  around.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:25):**  But also this data is available on multi-layered GIS maps in some university vaults that you  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:33):**  just have to somehow find the right academic to give you access to.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:38):**  But it's also looking at what is the current economic fabric, but also what was the past  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:44):**  economic fabric.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:45):**  Very often we can learn from what a place was like in the late 1800s, early 1900s, when  
**[0:47:56-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:47:56):**  basically places were still more bioregionally focused on their local strengths, so to speak.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:05):**  And from all that, to basically construct an image of what you're working with that  
**[0:48:17-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:17):**  then also makes you realize where the ill health, where the healing needs to take place,  
**[0:48:25-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:25):**  where development over the last 100, 150 years has created severe damage and how to undo  
**[0:48:33-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:33):**  that damage.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:34):**  And so the bigger meta question is, does it create conditions conducive to life?  
**[0:48:40-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:40):**  I think Janine Benio has really nailed it with this wonderful summary statement of biomimicry.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:46):**  Life creates conditions conducive to life.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:48):**  How do we do that in a way that is good for our species, but also all the other species  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:48:57):**  we co-inhabit our bioregion with?  
**[0:49:01-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:01):**  Not sure whether that answers your question.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:04):**  It does.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:05):**  And it gives you a really good framework to start from.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:08):**  I like that you mentioned talking to people who are connected more with the way things  
**[0:49:11-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:11):**  used to be and as useful as finding the detailed mapping data and conditions or I guess criteria  
**[0:49:22-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:22):**  that you can use as a baseline, there is something to be gained from getting someone's perspective  
**[0:49:29-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:29):**  on it as well.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:30):**  And the stories that come along with how things used to be, not just the data itself.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:34):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:35):**  And very often it's the elders.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:37):**  It's like, for example, so many in the UK now, there's a lot of trouble with flooding  
**[0:49:43-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:43):**  and it's because so many housing developments have been built in floodplains.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:50):**  So many.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:51):**  If somebody had bothered to just sit down and ask a local shepherd, what do you think  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:56):**  about this new development?  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:49:58):**  They would have said in a very strong accent, well, I wouldn't be building there because  
**[0:50:03-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:03):**  that meadow floods every 10 years.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:07):**  So it's these unique individual perspectives that have built up, people have built up over  
**[0:50:14-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:14):**  30, 40 years of living with and in the landscape that you need to find ways of searching out  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:21):**  or even looking at old images.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:23):**  I've just come across a wonderful book of Majorca with sort of before and after images  
**[0:50:29-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:29):**  of basically images taken in the 1910s, 1920s and what the exact place taken from the same  
**[0:50:37-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:37):**  angle looks like today.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:40):**  And unfortunately, it's quite jarring what we've done to this beautiful island.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:46):**  Now, we've been talking a lot at this point about the theory behind regenerative design,  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:54):**  community and cultural shifts.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:50:56):**  Can you talk about some of the examples that you've seen in your own travels and your own  
**[0:51:00-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:51:00):**  networking with other influential designers of communities, bioregions that are beginning  
**[0:51:07-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:51:07):**  to make the shift or have made shifts in certain ways towards this ideal that we're pursuing?  
**[0:51:14-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:51:14):**  Well, one wonderful network that really, I think, is going to find a new strength in  
**[0:51:22-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:51:22):**  the next few years is the Global Eco-Village Network and all these communities they connect,  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:51:29):**  whether it's the experimental communities that were set up in the 60s and 70s like Fintone  
**[0:51:35-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:51:35):**  and Auroville and The Farm and many others, but also the powerful way that the Global  
**[0:51:44-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:51:44):**  Eco-Village Network has worked with indigenous leaders in countries that are not part of  
**[0:51:52-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:51:52):**  the highly developed world and have given them back a new appreciation of their way  
**[0:52:01-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:01):**  of being, of not falling for this insidious development conversation of you are underdeveloped,  
**[0:52:10-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:10):**  these are highly developed countries, and to actually appreciate that very often indigenous  
**[0:52:17-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:17):**  place-based ways of living hold a kind of wisdom that the global north is trying to  
**[0:52:24-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:24):**  get back to.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:25):**  And Jen has done this effectively, for example, Senegal has a rural development strategy that  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:32):**  is basically built on eco-village development and similar things are happening in parts  
**[0:52:37-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:37):**  of India and other parts of Southeast Asia and it's also gaining strength in Latin America.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:47):**  But then there's other projects like, for example, Judy Wicks grew out of just a small  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:55):**  neighborhood cafe, the White Dog Cafe, she grew this wonderful network in Philadelphia  
**[0:52:59-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:52:59):**  called Bali, the business alliance for local living economies, which give a wonderful example  
**[0:53:06-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:53:06):**  of how to retrofit and rebuild and re-energize the local business and community fabric in  
**[0:53:17-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:53:17):**  a region in a way that increases the resilience of that place and also gives people more meaning  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:53:24):**  and more human connections.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:53:28):**  And then there are a number of cities that have done pioneering work in a more bi-regionally  
**[0:53:39-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:53:39):**  focused urban development approach, Curitiba in Brazil, Melbourne in Australia, but the  
**[0:53:47-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:53:47):**  thing is that because this is a journey and not a final destination, none of these places  
**[0:53:53-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:53:53):**  are perfect, but from all of these places we can learn elements of what might work and  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:00):**  again that's a nuance where I'm a little bit different in my orientation from the regenesis  
**[0:54:06-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:06):**  approach, they tend to not like case studies and examples because there's then that tendency  
**[0:54:14-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:14):**  of a sort of cookie cutter, cut and paste replication of something that worked somewhere  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:19):**  else in a new place which hardly ever works and so that's why staying with the story of  
**[0:54:24-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:24):**  place and drawing something new out of the essence of that place and the potential that  
**[0:54:30-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:30):**  comes from the capacity of the people and the essence of the place is a wonderful frame  
**[0:54:37-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:37):**  and it's useful and helpful, but I often think giving people examples of different ways of  
**[0:54:46-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:46):**  doing things and say well just try it on for size, explore how you would make this relevant  
**[0:54:51-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:51):**  to your local culture and your local uniqueness of place and if you find that it doesn't work  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:54:57):**  then don't use it or if you find you need to completely redesign it or change it, do  
**[0:55:03-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:03):**  so, but it still helps to highlight these best practice and best process examples and  
**[0:55:10-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:10):**  in my book I name a number of them and it might be like two, might take too long to  
**[0:55:18-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:18):**  run through a lot of them right now.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:20):**  No I understand, no I definitely agree with that, I think a lot of inspiration can come  
**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:27):**  from these examples, case studies and success stories that you mentioned, but absolutely  
**[0:55:33-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:33):**  as well that if you use them as okay well this worked here, let's try and implement  
**[0:55:37-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:37):**  the same thing, you miss a lot of the nuances and the differences in the context of where  
**[0:55:42-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:42):**  you're working, not only within the culture but the bio region, the species and you know  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:48):**  even micro climates, especially since I tend to work a lot more with individual clients  
**[0:55:53-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:53):**  on buildings and smaller scale permaculture designs, micro climates can play a huge role  
**[0:55:59-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:55:59):**  in that too to say nothing of the history of a place as well.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:02):**  So before I let you go, I've got one main question left that I would love your perspective  
**[0:56:07-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:07):**  on and that is, why do you do this work?  
**[0:56:11-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:11):**  What is it that motivates you and gives you hope that some real change can be made?  
**[0:56:18-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:18):**  Well on the one hand it just gives me an enormous amount of meaning, it puts me into a framework  
**[0:56:27-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:27):**  of, I used to say to people that I work in, I earn in two economies, I earn in the economy  
**[0:56:35-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:35):**  of money and I earn in the economy of meaning and for many years in the economy of money  
**[0:56:40-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:40):**  I just about made it to the end of the month and my coasting horizon of being able to pay  
**[0:56:47-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:47):**  rent without income was maybe three months or six months, but the economy of meaning,  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:55):**  in the economy of meaning I feel like I've been Bill Gates for many, many years.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:56:59):**  I just feel richly rewarded by this wonderful network of friends, collaborators and mentors,  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:07):**  particularly mentors, I've been very blessed to have learned from some of the real pioneers  
**[0:57:12-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:12):**  in all these fields that are now flowing together.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:18):**  So I do this work for future generations, again the indigenous practice is to ask with  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:28):**  everything you decide about what you want to do with your life, does it serve yourself,  
**[0:57:34-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:34):**  does it serve your community and does it serve the planet?  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:37):**  And for many years I found it really hard to ask the first of those questions because  
**[0:57:42-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:42):**  I was very focused on does it serve the planet, does it serve life, does it serve the community,  
**[0:57:48-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:48):**  but I felt that there was something wrong with asking does it serve me and I kind of  
**[0:57:53-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:57:53):**  learned the hard way that if you want this to be a marathon and not a horse race, if  
**[0:58:00-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:00):**  you want this to be something that works over the long term, you have to basically also  
**[0:58:07-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:07):**  nourish and support yourself because from that basis you can then effectively nourish  
**[0:58:14-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:14):**  and support your community or the wider community of life.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:18):**  And for me it's just been something that I sort of grew into over the last 20 years,  
**[0:58:24-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:24):**  that more and more I feel excited about serving this transition, what I call the regeneration  
**[0:58:32-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:32):**  rising, this planetary response.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:35):**  And in many ways since I've written my book, which is really when I started to make public  
**[0:58:43-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:43):**  some of the writing that I've done and some of the thinking that I've done for the last  
**[0:58:46-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:46):**  20 years, a lot of the stuff that I now put out on my Medium blog, like right now I'm  
**[0:58:54-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:54):**  putting out a lot of articles that I wrote in Spanish in 2003, 2004, 2005, but when I  
**[0:58:59-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:58:59):**  reread them I would change nuances in framing and language use, but the underlying intention  
**[0:59:09-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:09):**  and the information is still absolutely valid.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:13):**  And I learned from my mentor Brian Goodwin at Schumacher College, who is one of the co-founders  
**[0:59:20-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:20):**  of the Santa Fe Institute of Complexity Science, that if you want to affect positive emergence  
**[0:59:30-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:30):**  in a complex dynamic system that you can't predict and control, the one thing that you  
**[0:59:35-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:35):**  can do is design for positive emergence.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:39):**  You can't force the system to turn out in a certain way, but if you connect the right  
**[0:59:46-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:46):**  actors in the system with each other and you pay attention to the qualities of the relationships  
**[0:59:51-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:51):**  between them and you pay attention to the quality of information that flows to them  
**[0:59:57-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=0:59:57):**  and in the system, then the likelihood that what will emerge as an emerging property from  
**[1:00:03-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:03):**  the system to be positive and life-supporting and healthy and collaborative increases.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:11):**  And so my work in social media and on Facebook, Twitter and all these different channels is  
**[1:00:20-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:20):**  really spreading what I would call information that increases the likelihood for positive  
**[1:00:26-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:26):**  emergence.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:28):**  It's trusting that it can actually make a difference and it seems to be making a difference.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:34):**  There seems to be a real, and I'm not taking it on my shoulders, but somehow in the last  
**[1:00:38-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:38):**  two years, three years, I feel like there's a quickening, that more and more people are  
**[1:00:44-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:44):**  realizing that it's 20 past 12 and we should have acted a long time ago and we're still  
**[1:00:51-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:51):**  only talking about it.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:00:53):**  And that now is the time to really come together and to some extent it's the last stance of  
**[1:01:02-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:02):**  our species.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:03):**  It's a species-level rite of passage.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:06):**  We were asked to either become mature members in the community of life or bow out center  
**[1:01:12-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:12):**  stage left and say, okay, it was fun while at last digging up carbon and putting it into  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:21):**  the atmosphere.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:23):**  I really love two things that you mentioned there because they resonate a lot with my  
**[1:01:26-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:26):**  experience as well.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:27):**  And that was first of all, being paid into economies and that there are many different  
**[1:01:32-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:32):**  ways to come out with a, I'm trying to think of the word I always speak in Spanish, a ganancia  
**[1:01:39-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:39):**  or a profit.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:42):**  A profit for your efforts and for your time spent is not only something that comes back  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:48):**  to you in money and it's something I've been working on a lot in my own journey as well,  
**[1:01:53-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:53):**  but then you followed it up by saying that you've learned to sort of take care of yourself  
**[1:01:57-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:01:57):**  and in the longer vision, if you're burned out or if you don't have the resources and  
**[1:02:04-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:04):**  you're, especially if you're coming from a mentality of scarcity or a mindset of scarcity,  
**[1:02:10-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:10):**  I know in my own experience has caused me to make a lot of decisions either in the very  
**[1:02:14-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:14):**  short term or in a reactionary mode that has compromised sort of the longer term thinking  
**[1:02:20-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:20):**  that I've tried to cultivate.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:22):**  And sort of reminding people that taking care of yourself is an integral part of being effective  
**[1:02:27-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:27):**  at the community and the global level is something that I think, especially a lot of my friends  
**[1:02:31-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:31):**  and other people that I've connected with could stand to hear a few more times because,  
**[1:02:36-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:36):**  you know, dying on the cross of activism is far too common.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:42):**  And people's best intentions really start to fall apart when you make these decisions  
**[1:02:49-1:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:49):**  from a reactive mindset, when you come from a perspective of scarcity, when you don't  
**[1:02:53-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:53):**  have your own priority set that can allow you to live in the abundance that you're trying  
**[1:02:59-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:02:59):**  to seek for others.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:00):**  And I find it very powerful that you mentioned that as well.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:04):**  I think it is hugely important and it very much comes out of personal experience over  
**[1:03:08-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:08):**  the last 20 years of trying to walk this path.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:13):**  And it never stops.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:14):**  I still find myself very often talking to friends and saying, I'm trying to shift from  
**[1:03:20-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:20):**  the reactionary path of opportunity to just say, okay, here's somebody offering me a worthwhile  
**[1:03:27-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:27):**  project that I can be involved in and get paid for, to a much more long term and strategic  
**[1:03:35-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:35):**  path of intention and saying, okay, what is it that I actually want to build in the mid  
**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:42):**  and long term and what are the projects that serve that path as well as the short term  
**[1:03:47-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:47):**  need to pay the rent.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:50):**  And I still, particularly right now, in many ways, a friend of mine has recently called  
**[1:03:57-1:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:03:57):**  it drinking from the firehose.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:02):**  Things have changed for me in the last two years and I have become more visible to people  
**[1:04:08-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:08):**  and therefore I get a lot more offers of collaboration.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:10):**  But that has turned into me spending 30 hours a month on exploratory Skype and Zoom calls  
**[1:04:18-1:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:18):**  about potential projects or just giving advice to people because they told me about their  
**[1:04:23-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:23):**  project and it sounded cool and I wanted to not be impolite and help them.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:29):**  And in many ways, for me, 2019 on a very personal level is understanding that there are so many  
**[1:04:38-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:38):**  jobs out there worth doing in the world and so many projects that are worth supporting  
**[1:04:44-1:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:44):**  that I cannot take it on my shoulders to do them all myself or support them all with my  
**[1:04:50-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:50):**  participation.  
**[1:04:53-1:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:04:53):**  I can do whatever I do with spreading some of the information and doing podcasts and  
**[1:05:01-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:01):**  creating videos and writing.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:04):**  But if that all goes at the cost of me living on Mallorca in a community and working for  
**[1:05:11-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:11):**  the future of this island that is my home now and has been my home for the last eight  
**[1:05:15-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:15):**  years, then I'm beginning to risk my own personal integrity.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:23):**  And so I've made a very strong decision that for me 2019 is a return to mobile regional  
**[1:05:31-1:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:31):**  work here on Mallorca, basically facing that messy multi-stakeholder process we talked  
**[1:05:39-1:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:39):**  about earlier that I kind of ran away from when I wrote my book and started working more  
**[1:05:45-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:45):**  internationally again and just saying, no, I need to do both.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:50):**  I need to build my little permaculture farm here on the island and I need to show my daughter  
**[1:05:55-1:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:05:55):**  how to tell the difference between the early sprouts of a broccoli and a parsley and a  
**[1:06:02-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:02):**  turnip and a carrot because that is deep wisdom that will serve her maybe more than some of  
**[1:06:08-1:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:08):**  the things she learned in school.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:11):**  And so, yeah, I think it's an ongoing journey to make sure that we serve ourselves and our  
**[1:06:18-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:18):**  families because that is the basis of strength from which we then can work with our communities  
**[1:06:23-1:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:23):**  and the planet.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:25):**  And, yeah, watch this space.  
**[1:06:28-1:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:28):**  I'm sure you will try and I will try and we can every now and then compare notes and see  
**[1:06:34-1:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:34):**  how we're managing.  
**[1:06:35-1:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:35):**  Oh, it's marvelous.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:36):**  Yeah, those are things that I struggle with on a daily basis as well.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:39):**  Now, Daniel, could you tell our listeners how they can get in touch with you?  
**[1:06:43-1:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:43):**  I know you're pulling back a little bit.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:44):**  It's funny to ask that right after you say you're trying to focus a little more bioregionally.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:49):**  But how can our listeners find some of your resources and get in touch with you?  
**[1:06:54-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:06:54):**  Well, one easy way is to just hesitate to use the word Google because there are other  
**[1:07:00-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:00):**  search engines, but basically put into your search engine of choice my full name, Daniel  
**[1:07:06-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:06):**  Christian Wall and Medium, which is this aggregator blog medium dot com.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:11):**  And I've got probably about three hundred and ten, three hundred and fifteen articles  
**[1:07:16-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:16):**  and pieces, probably a couple of thousand pages of writing on that blog structured into  
**[1:07:24-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:24):**  a resource that's a good one, different headings.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:27):**  And then after years of boycotting Facebook, two years ago, I started to work on Facebook.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:34):**  And so there's my personal page, but there's also a page called Regenerative Cultures,  
**[1:07:39-1:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:39):**  just at Regenerative Cultures.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:41):**  And then I'm working in a kind of lighter way, sort of more inspirational quotes, beautiful  
**[1:07:47-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:47):**  images and memes that can make people's hearts sing with a guy called Christopher Chase in  
**[1:07:55-1:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:55):**  Japan.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:07:56):**  And we've got a Facebook page called Ecological Consciousness.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:00):**  So if you just need some daily inspirations, that's also a nice one.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:06):**  And then I'm on Twitter.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:10):**  And I've just recently put up more things on my YouTube channel.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:15):**  And actually one of the ways that I'm hoping to do more work locally and still continue  
**[1:08:22-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:22):**  some kind of global meme seeding work is that I will step into your footsteps and other  
**[1:08:28-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:28):**  people who've already started podcast series.  
**[1:08:31-1:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:31):**  And my intention for this year is to set up a not a one to one interview, but actually  
**[1:08:38-1:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:38):**  a series of conversations with all these wonderful elders and all these wonderful pathfinders  
**[1:08:45-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:45):**  in what I would call the regeneration rising and explore with them some of the deeper questions  
**[1:08:51-1:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:51):**  that we've also explored today.  
**[1:08:53-1:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:08:53):**  So watch this space and there'll be more of it starting March or April with conversations  
**[1:09:00-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:00):**  that I'm hoping to have with wonderful people.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:03):**  Oh, that is very exciting.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:05):**  I'll definitely keep a lookout for that.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:06):**  I can't wait to hear those conversations.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:09):**  Well Daniel, thank you so much for taking the time.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:11):**  It's been an absolute pleasure talking to you.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:13):**  And it's given me a lot of confidence that some of the topics and the things that you  
**[1:09:17-1:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:17):**  struggled with are not things that myself or my team are going through alone and that  
**[1:09:22-1:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:22):**  the complexity of our multi stakeholder endeavor is universally difficult.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:27):**  It definitely gives me a little confidence that we're not going this on our own.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:34):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:09:35-1:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:35):**  I'm glad you're out there and glad that there's so many more.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:38):**  Every day there's more of us out there.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:40):**  There are.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:41):**  I think things are shifting.  
**[1:09:44-1:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:44):**  They need to shift fast now, but I have a real sense of hope.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:49):**  The main thing is that we need to keep always aware of the unit, the greater unifying ground  
**[1:09:57-1:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:09:57):**  of not focusing on our differences with the things that connect us.  
**[1:10:03-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:03):**  Not going the path.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:04):**  I think that the big shift of building a regenerative future for humanity is the shift from competitive  
**[1:10:10-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:10):**  advantage to collaborative advantage.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:13):**  To understand that life is a non-zero sum game.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:18):**  You can actually create win-win-win solutions.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:22):**  That's how life has evolved over 3.8 billion years.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:27):**  If we learn how to design as life conditions conducive for life, then that's the future  
**[1:10:34-1:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:34):**  we will create.  
**[1:10:36-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:36):**  Well said.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:37):**  Well again, thank you Daniel.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:39):**  Let's definitely stay in touch.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:40):**  I would love to do a follow up interview with you sometime in a future season.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:45):**  Keep up the great work.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:46):**  I've gotten so much out of the resources and the writing and the publications that you've  
**[1:10:49-1:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:49):**  put out there.  
**[1:10:50-1:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:50):**  Thank you very much for that.

**[1:10:52-1:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:52):**  It was a nice conversation.  
**[1:10:53-1:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/https-www-abundantedge-com-abundantedge-daniel-christian-wahl/#t=1:10:53):**  All right, take care.

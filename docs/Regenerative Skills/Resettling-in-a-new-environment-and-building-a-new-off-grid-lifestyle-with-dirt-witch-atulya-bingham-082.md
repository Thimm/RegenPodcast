**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:02):**  I got lost there.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:04):**  Sorry, that was a full bag.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:08):**  So how did you relocate from Turkey and settle in a place in northern Spain?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:14):**  Well, I had to for a number of reasons.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:19):**  First of all, somebody started building next to me, right?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:21):**  So that was the first thing that happened in Turkey and I was pretty well protected.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:26):**  I only had one side that was open that had a neighbor and of course that side was, yeah,  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:33):**  that happened.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:34):**  So that was the first thing that made me, really pushed me to start thinking and then  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:39):**  of course the same year, in the same time, a number of other things happened and I really  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:45):**  felt the land was kicking me out and I've learned to pay attention when that kind of  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:49):**  thing happens and I feel I was absolutely right.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:52):**  I have no regrets at all about that decision.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:06:55):**  Politically, things went very wonky and subsequently they've gone economically wonky.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:04):**  So actually if I hadn't left when I did, I would have struggled to leave.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:09):**  So yeah, I think I was absolutely right in my decision and of course that shaped my…  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:16):**  So the last time when I did this on what I called my mountain in Turkey, it was a much  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:22):**  smaller plot.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:23):**  I didn't know what I was doing.

**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:34):**  sustainable lifestyle.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:35):**  I hadn't done that at all.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:37):**  I wasn't even in that frame of mind when I bought the land which had been a decade  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:41):**  earlier.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:42):**  So really I went onto the land and somehow hobbled through and survived, but I had no  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:51):**  water and for two years I was without running water in a dry area where it doesn't rain  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:56):**  for five months of the year.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:07:59):**  And yeah, I wasn't willing to do that again.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:03):**  Let's just say that.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:05):**  So already I had two criteria.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:06):**  I didn't want neighbours for one thing and I wanted water.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:10):**  And I would say to anybody who's looking to move off-grid, that should be your number  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:14):**  one thing that you're paying attention to because you can kind of get by with everything  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:19):**  else but you can't get by without water.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:23):**  There are other things that you look for as well that you start to pay attention to once  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:27):**  you've done it once.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:30):**  And so the next thing I paid attention to, you want some way of powering your land.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:36):**  I was looking for a south facing or a very sunny plot, which is what I've got.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:41):**  So it had to be a sunny plot.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:42):**  It had to have no neighbours.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:44):**  It had to have water and I have two water sources now.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:49):**  So like you, I'm kind of covered.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:08:52):**  I feel I'm covered.

**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:10:08):**  Yes, there's loads of things.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:10:11):**  Yes, really, really.

**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:18:29):**  In your previous project, you built yourself an earthbag house, which was, like you said,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:18:35):**  very well suited to your climate and your context.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:18:38):**  And now in such a different setting, you've chosen some other methods and in fact, you're  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:18:42):**  going to mostly be renovating a pre-existing structure on your land, isn't that right?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:18:47):**  Yeah, yeah, there will be quite a bit of rebuilding involved though.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:18:50):**  I mean, the roof will need entirely redoing, but yes, there's going to be a lot of, well,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:18:59):**  two of the cabanas are in, two of the stone huts are in beautiful condition with still  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:03):**  with the pre-existing mud mortar in them, which is such a joy.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:09):**  So they will be easy to renovate.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:11):**  I'll just simply have to make a mud mortar and fill in the gaps and point it all.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:17):**  But the big one has been badly restored with concrete and so I'm going to have to actually  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:22):**  take all that concrete out and then re-point it with mud mortar the original way.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:30):**  And I may even have to rebuild the stone walls and I'm not a stone expert, I can do the mud  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:35):**  easily and the cob, but at the moment I can't do stone.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:39):**  Someone did say to me, well, maybe you can learn, maybe I will.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:42):**  We'll see.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:43):**  But there's some, yeah, because the stonework really is, especially if you're not using  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:49):**  concrete, the stonework is key.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:52):**  So that's what I'll be doing this time.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:54):**  Then I plan to completely redo the interior with cob.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:19:59):**  So I create cob walls throughout.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:02):**  So it will be mud on the inside and insulating mud actually.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:06):**  This is, as I said, a temperate climb.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:07):**  It's not freezing climate.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:09):**  So an insulating cob will do the job, I think, perfectly.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:13):**  And yeah, on the outside it will be a renovated stone wall.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:17):**  And so what do you mean by an insulating cob?  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:20):**  Yeah, there's a number of ways you can make, or I should say earth plaster would be better.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:26):**  Well, no, some of it will be cob because it will be structural.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:28):**  But anyway, you can make cob or earth plaster insulating by adding an insulating ingredient  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:36):**  to it.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:37):**  A very easy way would be to throw in a lot more straw or throw in sawdust.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:44):**  Other things you can put into it are things like cork, cork granules.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:48):**  Some people have even put things like perlite into it.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:51):**  And they say it's worked.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:53):**  Paper pulp is another one.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:20:54):**  If you reduce the sand content and you bulk up the insulating ingredient, whatever it

**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:21:11):**  Yeah, so I've worked with this a little bit in the past.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:21:14):**  And it's really a matter of how light and fluffy you can get your mixture, the more

**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:21:27):**  or the insulative properties of the mix, right?  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:21:30):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:21:55):**  But because the temperature didn't stay that cold for very long, what happens is the earth  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:22:00):**  never gets time to completely, because it's thermal mass, so it takes ages for that cold  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:22:07):**  to go completely through.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:22:08):**  It never really got totally cold.

**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:22:15):**  It actually felt very snug.

**[0:22:20-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:22:20):**  And even earth, solid earth, has a higher R value and an insulative value than normal  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:22:28):**  concrete does.

**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:22:37):**  Even just earth.

**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:22:41):**  I agree with you.

**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:34:54):**  When it contracts back again it cracks.

**[0:35:01-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:35:01):**  Now lime is a drying out material so it mitigates the moisture problem in the plaster.

**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:37:04):**  the walls and then let it dry.

**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:37:10):**  You always do a very good job.

**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:38:07):**  reason that we added lime into the infill for the walls is that it helped to reduce

**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:38:28):**  but it has nothing to do with the structural integrity it's just you know that's naturally

**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:38:39):**  in the one in Turkey yeah yeah and yeah it's absolutely true because if you just throw

**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:39:35):**  as slowly as possible and they recommend one to two weeks right?  
**[0:39:41-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:39:41):**  Yeah and it's I went even even though mine was an earlier mixed with a bit of lime like  
**[0:39:48-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-resettling-in-a-new-environment-and-building-a-new-off-grid-lifestyle-with-dirt-witch-atulya-bingham-082/#t=0:39:48):**  yours I would wet it I wetted it every day for a week at least and yeah especially if

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:00:59):**  Are you the owner or promotions manager for a regenerative business or organization looking  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:01:22):**  to get your message out to a larger audience?  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:01:24):**  Finding your target audience for regenerative products and services can be tough, especially  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:01:28):**  while the movement is still in its infancy and awareness around the importance of ethical  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:01:32):**  business still has a long way to go.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:01:35):**  If you want to tap into a network of informed and motivated people with strong environmental  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:01:39):**  and community ethics who vote with their purchases, then you've come to the right place.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:01:44):**  The Abundant Edge Podcast now has more than 30,000 monthly listeners around the world

**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:11):**  best resource for regenerative skills education that it can be.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:16):**  Because of our commitment to the integrity of our message and our affiliations, this  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:19):**  offer is only open to businesses and organizations that are as committed to regenerative work  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:24):**  as we are.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:25):**  If this sounds like a good fit for you, go to the show notes for this episode to fill  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:29):**  out the collaborator application form.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:31):**  We look forward to helping you reach your highest potential.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:36):**  As I continue to explore the topics of natural building and ecological design in this ongoing  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:40):**  series, I had the pleasure of speaking again with Mark Lakeman.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:44):**  Now, Mark has been a big inspiration to me through the architectural work that he's  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:48):**  done at the community level and in exploring what it takes to design neighborhoods and  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:52):**  gathering places that help humans to reconnect to their sense of place and overcome the colonial  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:57):**  infrastructure that continues to separate us from each other and from lifestyles that  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:02):**  include all the facets of healthy living.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:05):**  Since I've mostly studied design at the building level, learning about ecological  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:09):**  and life enhancing ways of designing the infrastructure around us has been very eye opening to me  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:14):**  as I start to consider the larger impact that our built environment has on the way that  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:19):**  we live and how our cultures are shaped.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:22):**  Now in this episode, we take more of a philosophical approach to design than in previous interviews  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:27):**  where I focus mostly on techniques and methodologies.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:30):**  Here Mark speaks in detail about how, especially in North America and other colonized regions,  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:36):**  we operate in communities that were designed for efficiency and expansion rather than the  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:41):**  health of the inhabitants.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:43):**  As a result, even the basic grid of our streets and the zoning separation between commercial,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:48):**  residential and industrial areas creates the lifestyles where all functions are separated  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:54):**  and impersonal.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:55):**  One of my favorite enduring quotes of Mark's from a TED talk that he gave a while back  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:59):**  is,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:00):**  What good is our right to assembly without any place to assemble?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:03):**  And in turn we talk about some of the many projects that he and his teams have worked  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:07):**  on to bring places of gathering and assembly back into disconnected neighborhoods and the  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:12):**  uphill battle they face in navigating the bureaucracies and regulatory bodies that make  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:16):**  it difficult for people to contribute to public spaces.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:20):**  We also explore ideas on how to renovate and rejuvenate our community infrastructure to  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:24):**  reclaim our space and in turn become people of place once more.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:29):**  This is a thoughtful interview that links in with other conversations that I've published  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:32):**  in the past, so I've put links to the other interviews that we reference in the show notes  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:36):**  for this episode, including the original conversation that I had with Mark and his colleague Riddi  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:41):**  D'Cruz from a previous season.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:44):**  If you'd like to go back and hear more about Mark's background and how he started in community  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:48):**  architecture, but rather than giving everything away, I'll turn things over now to Mark.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:54):**  Hey, Mark, thanks so much for taking the time to be with me here today.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:57):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:58):**  I'm doing great, Oliver.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:00):**  Thanks for getting together like this to share some stories.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:03):**  Yeah, it's such a pleasure to be able to catch up with you again.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:06):**  Now it was almost say about two years ago since I spoke with you and your colleague  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:11):**  Riddi D'Cruz.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:13):**  So if anybody's interested in hearing more about your background or hearing some perspectives  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:18):**  from Riddi from your team with City Repair Project, they can go back to that original  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:22):**  interview and I'll put links to that in the show notes for this podcast episode.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:27):**  So let's jump past the background information and talk a little bit about the impact that  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:34):**  civic planning and architecture can have on our lives and how it can affect the way that  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:40):**  we interact or disconnect with our communities.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:44):**  That's exciting.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:45):**  I live for this conversation.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:47):**  Okay, well, would you like me to just kind of just start generally then?  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:51):**  Yeah, go ahead and just kind of give me an idea of how you see those topics because I  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:55):**  know that this is the world in which you work with kind of on a full time basis.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:00):**  Okay.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:01):**  Well, I think I'm I think I'm always finding myself navigating kind of different paradigms  
**[0:06:09-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:09):**  of seeing, I think, like a lot of constructive activists, they have this reference in what  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:17):**  they think or what they feel is an essential human way of being or essential human condition.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:24):**  And I think that might for a lot of people that probably boils down into a kind of a  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:30):**  democratic or anarchistic sense like that you should be able to participate and have  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:37):**  a voice should be able to affect your environment pretty directly and not be too encumbered  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:44):**  by bureaucracy or needing to be part of a culture that has to ask permission.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:49):**  For me, as an architect and planner, my reference is to kind of have a historical perspective  
**[0:06:57-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:57):**  and look at kind of over the sweep of time at sort of village cultures that have emerged  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:05):**  around the planet over time and understand that as place based communities, they were  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:11):**  able to really directly affect their environment in fact to transform or alchemize their environment  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:18):**  into a, you know, urban forms and agricultural systems without having without even being  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:23):**  able to, or maybe even wanting to import a lot from outside of their bioregions.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:30):**  So my reference point is that the majority of human history, people have been working  
**[0:07:36-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:36):**  within bioregional frameworks to create the systems and the structures that they inhabit,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:44):**  the social systems, the architecture, the village forms.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:49):**  And as opposed to that, which would, you know, let me just say more about that.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:54):**  I mean, in that context, you would presume that people are able to express themselves  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:00):**  and as they're meeting their needs, they're solving problems.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:04):**  And as they're doing that, they're building their community because they're solving problems  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:08):**  together and meeting their needs together.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:09):**  So they, you know, develop stronger linkages and relationships with each other.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:16):**  I think a lot of people in their sense of how the world should be, it's kind of based  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:20):**  on a sense that that's been our history, but also that we're biologically wired to feel  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:26):**  that that is righteous and that is the way that we should live.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:30):**  I feel that way.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:32):**  So I bring that into my work within the modern city, in the modern world.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:38):**  And you know, I'm constantly interfacing with systems that are really set up to serve development  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:45):**  interests, you know, that someone can engage the land and other human beings more from  
**[0:08:53-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:53):**  a profit motive point of view, and then create landscapes that serve their desire for a return  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:01):**  as opposed to the people living there, you know, creating something that helps them meet  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:07):**  their needs.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:08):**  Instead, a lot of this, in my opinion, ends up being a kind of an artifice that looks  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:14):**  and works a lot like how we would like to create landscapes, except in the end, the  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:20):**  result isn't to build community, but more, you know, maybe to build someone's bank account.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:25):**  So I live in that spectrum, that disparity spectrum between how I think I would like  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:33):**  to live in the world, and then the world that we're living in.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:38):**  And I navigate between those poles, trying to figure out ways to elicit and re-express,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:47):**  re-emerge, help to re-emerge ways for people to participate and create and connect with  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:55):**  each other.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:56):**  And I try to sort of, you know, work with human beings within the system who also feel  
**[0:10:02-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:02):**  this way, even if they're bureaucrats, to humanize and temper the bureaucratic and profit-oriented  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:09):**  structures that we find ourselves in, in order to help create more just relationships and  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:16):**  designs.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:19):**  So I think that's an overarching partial answer there.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:22):**  No, that's a really good way of putting it.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:25):**  But it always leads me to this question when people have kind of a vision for what they  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:29):**  want to achieve.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:31):**  I'm interested in knowing what you use as reference for healthy infrastructure and civic  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:37):**  planning or community infrastructure that facilitates connectivity and that ability  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:43):**  to kind of influence in a healthy way, the way that you interact with the people in your  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:49):**  daily life.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:50):**  Yeah, I've got a really practical answer to that.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:54):**  Well, yeah, so here we are living in the USA, and about 20 years ago or 25 years ago in  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:05):**  my career, I came back from a series of kind of cultural immersions where I was basically  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:12):**  out asking different communities and cultures around the world what they could see about  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:18):**  the USA and what they could also see about me and what they would advise me and us to  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:24):**  do about our condition because obviously there's massive challenges that we have here like,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:30):**  you know, across the spectrum of so-called prime, we sometimes have these statistics  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:37):**  that are 10 times more distressing than other cultures that are related to us.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:42):**  The answer that I got back was basically to notice, when I got home, to notice that we  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:48):**  all live in this colonial infrastructure that is an expression of participation at all.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:55):**  It's really designed as a development mechanism, and the practical simple answer to your question  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:00):**  is to look around and notice that there's almost no public squares in any neighborhood  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:06):**  across the entire country.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:09):**  And to understand, you know, the advice I got was to understand that there's this really  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:14):**  terrible, terrible, like horrific absence in our midst, that we actually have to travel  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:21):**  across the ocean to visit villages where, you know, living and working is in close proximity,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:28):**  not zoned like American cities are where you have to transit the landscape to go and earn  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:34):**  money, leave the home zone to go to the work zone to earn the money to pay for the home  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:39):**  zone where you barely get to live.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:41):**  So the practical response to your question, the simple one, is we focus on restoring community  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:47):**  gathering places to the American grid, really the North American grid for the most part,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:54):**  as a way of helping people not just to see that there's been a gathering place missing  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:59):**  the whole time and then restore it, but also to restore the interactive vitality that is  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:05):**  also missing and latent at the same time in every community.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:10):**  So we're saying, hey, everyone wake up, look, you live in the colonial grid, you're zoned  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:15):**  so that you just are kind of this mono-cultural condition where everyone just lives in these  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:20):**  tracks, where almost nobody speaks because there's no place for people to gather, but  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:26):**  also by omitting gathering places, you're also omitting the stewardship culture dynamism  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:33):**  that would be engaging in that space and stewarding it over time.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:36):**  And then you're also omitting the cultural rituals and celebrations that would be happening  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:43):**  otherwise cyclically and spontaneously in that space.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:47):**  And then you're also therefore missing the automatic connection of living and working  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:52):**  that would also happen.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:54):**  So we're politically disempowered by the absence of gathering places and then there's all of  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:00):**  these other related really horrific outcomes that play out in the form of some of the worst  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:07):**  public health statistics in the world.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:11):**  So our design projects, dozens of them going on at the same time, all have to do with reengaging  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:19):**  people to not just dialogue, but to physically create gathering places in their midst once  
**[0:14:25-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:25):**  again, some of the forms that this takes are political, like we have new ordinances that  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:33):**  we've been helping to establish across the USA and Canada for people to be able to literally  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:38):**  recreate street intersections and turn them into public squares.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:44):**  And that's based on the observation that in ancient free automobile urban fabric where  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:51):**  crime statistics are super low and public health indicators are really high, the gathering  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:56):**  place literally happens where people's pathways converge, you know, so-called crossroads of  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:01):**  the village.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:02):**  We're basically restoring crossroads of the village to the colonial grid of the USA and  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:07):**  Canada with remarkable public health outcomes and then impacts even on crime.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:13):**  So that's our main like leverage point over and over and over again.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:18):**  And it seems the overall kind of project seems to be taking limitless varieties of forms  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:26):**  in every project that we do.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:29):**  Now you and I were speaking just a little bit before we started recording this episode  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:33):**  about how we've both done a good bit of traveling and my reference to some of the things that  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:37):**  you were mentioning, like having a common town square and places of assembly kind of  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:41):**  built into the infrastructure have often been in places where colonialization has really  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:47):**  left a mark.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:49):**  Actually the last time that you and I spoke, I was living in Guatemala actually up until  
**[0:15:52-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:52):**  recently and even in very small towns there, the central church and the government building  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:01):**  usually surround a public park.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:05):**  And even in small towns, you'll find this configuration as a leftover of Spanish colonial  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:09):**  culture.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:10):**  And now that I'm actually in Spain, seeing where this, you know, civic design kind of  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:16):**  originated or at least before it was exported over to those areas, I definitely notice a  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:22):**  difference in the way that people assemble and the way that towns get together and practice  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:26):**  ceremonies and rituals.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:28):**  You know, even though it's very different from the original colonizing culture that  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:34):**  brought it over to that area.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:36):**  But that being said, there are still a lot of disconnects that come even from that.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:42):**  What have you noticed about the way that other types of colonial infrastructure have either  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:47):**  hurt or facilitated these healthier community infrastructures?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:52):**  Wow.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:53):**  Great, great, huge question.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:55):**  I got a couple of things just to start with.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:58):**  First of all, you've just touched down on a really important kind of parallel to the  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:05):**  North American grid.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:07):**  So north of the border that we share with Mexico, we have the national land ordinance  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:16):**  in the USA and then in Canada, it's the Dominion Land Survey.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:20):**  And in both cases, it's a proscription or, yeah, really it proscribes.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:27):**  Both of those systems, just like south of the border where you have the law of the Indies  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:33):**  that the Spanish enacted to create plazas and zocalos in all of the cities and towns,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:39):**  even in Guatemala where you were, you have basically two different kinds of ordinances.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:44):**  The ones in the USA and Canada are essentially the same.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:48):**  They're very similar and profoundly importantly different from the law of the Indies that  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:55):**  affected places like Guatemala.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:57):**  The similarity is that they are all designed to eliminate and wipe out pre-existing cultural  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:04):**  patterns, literally to wipe out pathways, wipe out mentalities too.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:10):**  Like if the native population had some kind of sensibility about how they saw themselves  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:17):**  in relation to the land that was expressed in their urban form, that had to be eliminated.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:23):**  And so with the national land ordinance of the USA or the law of the Indies of Spain,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:29):**  you were basically saying, first of all, fundamentally, the land is now a commodity and we're going  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:34):**  to cut it up according to this giant grid infrastructure with certain key reference  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:39):**  points for surveying, which is kind of how it begins to be laid out.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:44):**  But fundamentally, the land is seen as a commodity and then within that space, time and even  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:51):**  life force, including human beings, seen as labor force, is also part of what is enacted  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:57):**  within the plan.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:59):**  So that's the ways that they're similar to see that the world is now for sale in this  
**[0:19:03-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:03):**  colonial infrastructure that we will use as an extraction design that will enable us to  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:11):**  take the proceeds and reap them and bring them back to the motherland.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:15):**  And in the case of law of the Indies, Spain intended to hold all these colonies and then  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:21):**  just reap whatever benefit they could from the people and the place and bring it back  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:26):**  to Spain as we know they did.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:28):**  The difference though is that Spain mandated that there be a plaza and zocalo in every  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:34):**  city and town.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:35):**  In fact, per population, there would be multiple plazas and zocalos.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:42):**  And you can see some of the intent or the malintent in the way that plazas and zocalos  
**[0:19:49-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:49):**  tend to be bookended by government institutions that are able to oversee the space and can  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:57):**  kind of control it.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:59):**  You can also see it in the way that plazas and zocalos, in a beautiful way, they integrate  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:06):**  planting, but they also really limit the scale of gathering open spaces within plazas and  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:13):**  zocalos.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:14):**  In fact, dividing up the space oftentimes with statues and pavilions to make it so that  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:20):**  the crowds can't be quite too big, except for in Mexico City where the Plaza Mayor is  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:28):**  gigantic.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:29):**  Anyway, that's the ways that they're different.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:32):**  Let's see, maybe I should just stop there.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:36):**  I don't think I've come quite back.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:38):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:39):**  No, I hear what you're saying.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:41):**  Now, given those two references as colonial cultures, which you've been working actively  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:46):**  to try and overcome the shortcomings and the violence inherent in those infrastructure  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:52):**  plans, what are some of the most effective ways that you've seen or that you've been  
**[0:20:57-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:57):**  able to implement for people to get together on a human scale and reassemble by transforming  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:06):**  either places of gathering or creating ones where there weren't before?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:10):**  Okay.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:11):**  Well, this is a really essential answer.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:15):**  The most effective thing is for people, God, however they get there, to seize their own  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:22):**  power and start to act directly.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:25):**  Now, we have created ordinances that have seriously liberalized the relationship of  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:32):**  local communities to their own public space.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:37):**  In cities across the continent, people are told they have no power in their own neighborhood,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:42):**  like to put in a speed bump or to put in a bench or a little free library or something  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:47):**  out in the space between the sidewalk and the street.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:51):**  Certainly they can't do anything out in the street.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:55):**  In our case, we now have legal structures that have been negotiated with the city council  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:59):**  and the department of transportation that oversees something like 22,000 intersections  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:05):**  in our city and something like 6,000 residential right-of-way miles.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:11):**  We now have ordinances that let people literally walk right outside and build shit without  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:17):**  getting a permit.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:18):**  They're automatically permitted and insured simply by creating.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:23):**  So what we have there is the system actually saying, we're going to be a real democratic  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:29):**  mechanism and support your initiative.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:32):**  You the resident are now so powerful, you can do anything you want and we will support  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:38):**  you with the might of our joint collaborative economy.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:45):**  That's an incredible change.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:47):**  But the answer to your question is basically to realize we were only able to accomplish  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:53):**  all of that by forcing the bureaucracy and the political leadership to come to the table.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:01):**  Because when we tried to appeal to them and say, look, we have all these statistics that  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:06):**  in all these goals and plans, we have all these benchmarks we've tried to establish  
**[0:23:10-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:10):**  for accomplishing sustainability and urban livability that require us to act locally  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:19):**  in our own neighborhoods as place-based people.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:23):**  And the city would say, well, you know, that's never been done before, so we can't do it.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:27):**  So they're not responsive usually when you appeal to them collaboratively.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:33):**  So the answer to your question is people have to do it anyway, whether it is legal yet or  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:37):**  not, people just have to do it.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:40):**  And believe it or not, Oliver, that's how you make it legal.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:44):**  Every single time, we've broken many laws in this city.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:47):**  And not because we enjoy breaking laws, it's like, oh, God dang it, here we are again,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:52):**  where they're not being responsive and they're forcing us to break the rules in order to  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:57):**  change the rules.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:58):**  So then we'll do it again.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:00):**  And whether we're changing an energy code or a way that we're able to use public space  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:04):**  or we're changing the way that, you know, park regulations work.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:09):**  There's lots of different ways that you have to end up challenging the system.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:13):**  We've ended up being forced to do it on our own authority and having to stand there and  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:17):**  have people get mad at us simply because they weren't able to be flexible enough or to care  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:22):**  enough to say yes.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:23):**  I mean, honestly, when bureaucracy is remote and disinterested, and it almost always is  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:28):**  because it is not place-based, and the system comes up against the needs of place-based  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:34):**  people, you're going to always have that contradiction.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:37):**  Here's the difference.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:39):**  Place-based people care about each other.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:40):**  They see each other in the eyes.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:42):**  They come and go every day, even though, you know, you might come out of your house and  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:48):**  say hi to your neighbor and not really get to know them because living and working have  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:51):**  been disintegrated and you don't really get to work together.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:54):**  Still, you see each other enough.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:56):**  Your children might play together enough that at a certain point, you talk and you care  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:01):**  enough about your condition that you want to slow traffic to, you know, to make the  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:06):**  streets safer for your children to be near because they're out there on their bikes or  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:10):**  something or you talk to each other and you're concerned about the state of the world and  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:15):**  it's not good enough to just be getting it pre-digested from the papers.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:19):**  Like you want to put in composting systems or you want to put in district energy systems.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:24):**  At a certain point, you have some professionals maybe living next to each other or a carpenter  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:29):**  lives next together, next to a caregiver.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:31):**  They start to get ideas that make them feel like they could accomplish it with their skills  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:36):**  and talents.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:37):**  And so, you know, you start to like think that, hey, maybe my capability could be applied  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:42):**  here.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:43):**  And of course, the bureaucracy is unresponsive.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:47):**  There's a lot of reasons for that.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:49):**  People have all kinds of ways of understanding the bureaucracy, but they're not fundamentally  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:54):**  place-based.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:55):**  They're not connected to the real issues.  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:58):**  They're connected to their own neighborhood.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:59):**  So if you remind them, you know, like one time I had to say to a bureaucrat, you know  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:04):**  what we're doing?  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:05):**  We're trying to help you too because your neighborhood doesn't have a freaking public  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:08):**  square either.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:09):**  And they're like, well, okay, that's true.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:13):**  You know, and then we actually got them to start to relate to why we needed to create  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:17):**  a public square ourselves.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:18):**  And then they began to help us to legalize it.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:22):**  So we're always navigating this disparity between the fact that communities are place-based  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:28):**  and bureaucracy and political systems aren't.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:30):**  They all come from kind of everywhere else to come together to do job descriptions.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:36):**  And they don't really get to jail as a, in a sense of community themselves.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:40):**  So every time a place-based community sort of stands up and has to challenge the regulations  
**[0:26:44-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:44):**  and force the rules to change, it even benefits the bureaucrats and politicians that are opposing  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:51):**  them.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:52):**  I'm actually getting rather tired of always having to navigate this ridiculous set of  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:00):**  contradictions.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:01):**  But now we know how to do it and we're successful every time.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:04):**  But it always has to start, this is the answer to your question, over in Oregon, people have  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:08):**  to reclaim their power, face the paradoxes that they already are inhabiting and just  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:14):**  say to themselves, no one else can freaking have my power.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:17):**  I refuse to ask permission anymore for things that are simply common sense.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:21):**  You know, speaking of Guatemala, one of my favorite examples of this is in Guatemala  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:27):**  where you might have some teenager driving through the neighborhood too quickly, very  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:33):**  frequently.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:34):**  And then somebody says, all right, let's get out the two by four with nails in it again.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:37):**  And they drag it across the street in order to force cars to slow down.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:42):**  And you can only get the two by four pulled out from in front of your car if you donate  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:46):**  some money into a can for the local school fund.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:49):**  Like neighborhoods in Guatemala literally affects serious traffic calming by themselves  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:56):**  under their own authority without having to ask permission.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:00):**  And a two by four with some nails in it is enough to slow down all the cars.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:04):**  And you wouldn't dream of doing that in the U.S. today because we're so cowed by the authorities.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:11):**  But in Guatemala, not that way.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:14):**  It was amazing to witness that kind of self authorization.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:16):**  Yeah, I have to say I witnessed a lot of those types of self-government acts in the various  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:22):**  communities that I had a chance to interact with while I lived there.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:25):**  And a lot of it comes from the fact that, you know, larger governmental bodies are quite  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:30):**  ineffectual the further you get away from the capital city.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:34):**  And given that we were about five hours drive most of the time that I was living in Guatemala,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:40):**  you start to feel the effects of government much, much less, especially as you get into  
**[0:28:44-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:44):**  the rural areas and seeing how local Alcalde's and other kind of community leaders found  
**[0:28:53-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:53):**  ways, creative ways to, yeah, exactly sort of enforce laws, but also create a sense that,  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:02):**  you know, we're in this together and punishment isn't so much as getting rid of the problem  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:08):**  as finding a way of sort of with it in house.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:11):**  And I've been fortunate enough to see pretty inspiring examples of that all over the world.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:16):**  But to go back to something that you were kind of touching on and somewhat dancing around  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:21):**  is this idea of becoming people of place again.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:24):**  And I've heard it sort of explained in a number of different ways, perhaps reindigenizing  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:30):**  oneself as well.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:32):**  Give me an idea of how one can start to cultivate a mindset of getting back into their own power  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:39):**  and understanding what it is that we should consider our rights as citizens and as members  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:45):**  of communities so that we can actually think outside of the infrastructure that we were  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:50):**  born into.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:51):**  And many of us, much like a fish does not realize that it's swimming in water, we don't  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:56):**  realize that there are many other ways to live given just how prolific this type of  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:02):**  infrastructure is.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:03):**  Boy, that's such a great question.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:06):**  Thanks for asking that question.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:07):**  Let me ask you to talk about it.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:10):**  Well, I have a lot of lived experience that can help with this.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:17):**  I guess the first thing I want to say is that for a lot of us, we feel like we have to kind  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:23):**  of understand everything before we can act or before we can know what to do.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:29):**  And I just want to advise people listening to this that I think the best that you can  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:34):**  do is come to a point of action because you'll never figure it all out.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:40):**  You have to kind of, and I totally understand that kind of desperate desire to have a framework.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:50):**  I think what helps me to just really, God, I got to this place where I absolutely committed  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:57):**  to the ground that I was standing on.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:00):**  And I almost had to laugh because if you were to ask me in the abstract, Mark, where would  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:05):**  you like to live the rest of your life?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:07):**  Where would you stand your ground for your village culture?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:11):**  I would have either said, the ground, the land of my Celtic ancestors, I shall return  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:16):**  to that place in Lakeland of England.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:22):**  I might've said that, or I might've said, I'm going to go to an island in Thailand because  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:29):**  it's the most beautiful place I can imagine.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:30):**  But where it was, was actually one of the most mundane choices I possibly could have  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:37):**  made in the world.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:39):**  A typical colonial grid neighborhood where I myself had grown up.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:44):**  That was where I was the moment that I realized that the ultimate revolution and the finding  
**[0:31:49-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:49):**  of my power would be to stand my ground permanently in a place and just hammer on that location  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:58):**  with all my power and create a continuity of relationship over time to the people and  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:05):**  to the environment and just keep affecting change and affecting change from there.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:11):**  But it was in the last place I would have thought I would have made that commitment,  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:16):**  the very place where I grew up, that I was wanting to escape.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:21):**  And it has really worked out perfectly in a lot of ways.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:25):**  Its very mundanity makes it, and repetition and its sameness is a perfect context for  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:33):**  generating prototypes that can help people in all of these other conditions that are  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:38):**  really very much the same, to inspire them to make change themselves.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:44):**  So I guess what I'm saying is for anybody listening here, I would recommend that to  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:50):**  just get to the point where you decide to commit.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:56):**  And you won't know all the same things I know, you'll just know what you know, you'll know  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:00):**  what you know.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:02):**  But you can know this, like you can ask yourself this question and come up with your own answer  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:06):**  like when in the freaking world am I finally going to be home?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:12):**  Am I always going to keep dreaming of a better place?  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:15):**  Like you know once I have enough money I'll sell this place or I'll stop renting this  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:20):**  place and I'll go live in a co-housing community or ecovillage outside of town or I'll move  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:26):**  to another country to escape this crass capitalism or whatever your dream might be.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:32):**  For myself it was just this moment where I was like aha I see committing to place, calling  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:38):**  myself a villager.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:40):**  Like what I did was I just was like I shot my cat down into the planet in that moment.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:48):**  I was like oh my god I just need to commit to somewhere and set in my roots and hold  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:54):**  the ground.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:55):**  At that time I would have these dreams like of a storm, that I was a tree and I kept trying  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:03):**  to hold soil and the storm was blowing the soil away from my roots.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:08):**  And I kept trying to grab particles of ground to aggregate it back and the storm was relentless  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:17):**  and it was hopeless and then another plant would somehow come along and its roots would  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:22):**  join with mine and we would start to be able to hold some soil.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:25):**  And it was literally a metaphor for what was going on in my neighborhood.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:29):**  Like just as soon as we were building community and all these people within four square blocks  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:34):**  knew each other with our first intersection guerrilla project.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:38):**  As soon as we knew each other then we saw that people were moving and then we were like  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:43):**  oh my god this is happening all the time and we don't even know it because we don't even  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:48):**  know each other.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:49):**  That everyone's always moving like Americans move every four to seven years and we could  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:54):**  see it happening right in our own experience.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:56):**  That was empowering, it was demoralizing but it was also empowering.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:00):**  Like we've got to stop moving.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:02):**  We've got to hold our ground together and so the consequences of holding our ground  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:10):**  have been things like new civic ordinances like I was saying that make it so that everyone  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:16):**  across the city can revolutionize their own relationship to the right-of-way.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:23):**  Opening up pathways within the blocks to connect everyone internally.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:26):**  So you've been really decompartmentalizing the grid of isolation and turning it into  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:32):**  a landscape of connection.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:34):**  Lots and lots of food is being grown all over the place.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:37):**  Places for children to play.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:39):**  We've stabilized the community so almost no one moves anymore.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:43):**  People have studied us and published reports in health journals.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:48):**  Basically crime has plummeted and people are mentally and physically healthier but the  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:55):**  main thing is the project then has replicated across the continent in like more than a hundred  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:59):**  cities and we don't even know anymore how many cities.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:03):**  So by standing our ground and I'm like I'm standing my ground.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:07):**  I'm inviting other people to stand their ground.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:09):**  By standing your ground and claiming your place you also claim your power.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:14):**  If you say that you have a relationship to place and you start to act from a place of  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:19):**  connection, it leads you to do things that are positively revolutionary and sometimes  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:25):**  outside of or within the rules and there is no more powerful place to be coming from if  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:30):**  you want to change your city and offer prototypes and stories to inspire other people than that  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:37):**  Mark, I think it's remarkable that it seems that as I get better at doing these interviews  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:44):**  I end up talking with people at just the right time to give me some confidence in difficult  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:50):**  decisions that I've made and if anybody who's listening now has sort of followed the genesis  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:56):**  of this podcast they've heard me go through everything from like kind of being a little  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:01):**  bit uprooted and being an apprentice at a friend of mine's in Guatemala to like co-investing  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:08):**  on a farm and really feeling like I finally had found my home and then also the displacement  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:14):**  that I felt as that arrangement became I mean it wasn't we weren't all going in the same  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:19):**  direction and I decided to move again but I represent exactly that generation that you're  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:25):**  talking about.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:26):**  I've moved, man I can't even count how many times I've basically been traveling independently  
**[0:37:31-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:31):**  for almost 14 years now and we're literally having this conversation about four days into  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:38):**  me settling into the spot that I've decided is going to be my home and where I'm going  
**[0:37:42-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:42):**  to stand my ground and so many of the things that you've just said resonate with this journey  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:50):**  that I've gone on and realizing that there's no place that you can decide on going that's  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:57):**  going to be perfect certainly not in how damaged and disconnected our world has become at this  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:02):**  point and if you're looking for the perfect place you won't find it you will constantly  
**[0:38:07-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:07):**  keep moving but if you decide that you're going to be sort of the change or the conduit  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:15):**  for the good things that you find missing in the place that you decide to go home or  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:19):**  that you decide to stand your ground on then you actually have a chance at creating where  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:25):**  and how you want to live and sort of with that said I would love to hear about some  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:31):**  of the projects that you and your team have worked on that have started to create that  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:37):**  meaningful change within the neighborhoods that you've been able to interact with and  
**[0:38:41-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:41):**  work in.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:42):**  Can you say that last sentence again?  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:44):**  That was a beautiful beautiful response there to all that I had said.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:49):**  Say that last sentence again, question?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:51):**  Yeah well let's explore some of the projects that you and your team have worked on within  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:57):**  the communities that you've had the chance to interact with.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:00):**  I know you've done designs for co-housing developments within I think it was in Portland.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:06):**  You've worked with city repair at sort of rejuvenating those intersections like you  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:11):**  had mentioned earlier.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:13):**  What are some of the projects that you feel have taught you the most about sort of the  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:18):**  steps that can start to reconnect these disconnected infrastructures?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:22):**  Okay I'll kind of talk about small things and giant larger things and giant things.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:31):**  By all means.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:33):**  Let's see well smaller things smaller things that kind of are doable at a community scale  
**[0:39:41-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:41):**  can happen at you know places like in your neighborhoods or schools or people's businesses.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:50):**  I'm thinking right now of this installation that I've been helping people to do some maintenance  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:58):**  on recently.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:00):**  It seems like such a small thing.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:03):**  It's in someone's front yard.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:06):**  It's an earth and masonry project.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:08):**  It's very very sculptural and it's inspired by this epiphany that a man had.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:14):**  He was reading an article.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:17):**  His name was Fatah and he was reading an article about how the majority of what we see in our  
**[0:40:24-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:24):**  society is kind of historically it's been created by enacted or decided upon or created  
**[0:40:34-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:34):**  or literally physically built by white men between 35 and 75 or something like that.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:45):**  And after this this after Fatah got done reading this article he was really upset.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:51):**  He was like my God the spectrum of possibility is really in my own experience has been limited  
**[0:40:58-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:58):**  by men who are traditionally emotionally stunted and their capacity to express and to emote  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:06):**  is limited.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:07):**  We're actually living within the mental framework of what they think is possible or appropriate  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:11):**  in the world.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:14):**  And part of the article that he read was suggesting that perhaps a more sustainable reality would  
**[0:41:20-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:20):**  be more inclusive and expressive of a broader spectrum of human possibility.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:28):**  So it happened that Fatah was connected to this family, a mother and a couple of little  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:34):**  girls across the street.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:36):**  He just marched across the street and he asked the little girl who was about six what she  
**[0:41:42-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:42):**  thought needed to happen in the world.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:45):**  He said with all the changes that are happening in our city what do you think needs to happen?  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:49):**  What would you what would make the world a better place?  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:52):**  So that's this installation that he ended up building in his front yard is the vision  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:56):**  of the little girl who was his friend.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:00):**  He facilitated the creation of it.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:02):**  He brought this fantastic builder from Canada, Pat Heneberry.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:07):**  It's kind of a legend.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:09):**  That's one of my heroes.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:12):**  I use one of my first guests on this podcast.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:14):**  Oh my gosh, beautiful.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:16):**  Thank you.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:17):**  I don't know if you know, but Pat, you know, he's got Parkinson's disease now and it's  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:23):**  very severe at this point.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:24):**  I just saw him about a month ago and he's certainly not long for this world.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:31):**  So the restoration of that project right now is front burner for me.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:36):**  It's a murder situation.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:39):**  Anyway, what was created looks like this giant wave inspired by this little girl's vision.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:44):**  I mean, part of the conversation that Fada had with her was that she always wished that  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:49):**  she had a big sister who was a mermaid.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:52):**  So if you go to see this little gathering place, it's in the form of a wave with a lighthouse  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:59):**  and a mermaid and it's all made out of cob.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:01):**  It's very gaudiest and it looks, I mean, it does all the things that we want it to do.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:07):**  You know, it quests the private edge of public space and it says, instead of fortifying that  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:16):**  edge or trying to delineate what's mine and what's yours or what's not yours and what's  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:21):**  mine, as most edges tend to do, it says, come across the edge.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:27):**  Come into the embrace of this fabulous fantasy of a better world, of a more sculptural and  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:33):**  inspiring story.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:35):**  And of course it's modeling sustainability because it's made by human hands.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:39):**  You just, it's inescapable.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:40):**  It's the most beautiful, lovingly crafted place.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:44):**  It's in this completely fantastical form with this luminous roof floating overhead made  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:51):**  out of parts and pieces from the ocean.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:55):**  So that's small, but it's actually gigantic because it provides an example for everyone  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:00):**  living with that same mundane edge of private versus public.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:05):**  And it invites people to reconsider whether or not they'd like to invite people across  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:10):**  the line or whether they'd like to fortify that line.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:13):**  I'm happy to tell you that project has contributed to, you know, something like 700 similar projects  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:19):**  across this city.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:21):**  So it's just, you know, it seems small, but it's actually gigantic because it becomes  
**[0:44:25-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:25):**  a way of inspiring change everywhere where people live individually or with family.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:32):**  And they contribute to that, you know, to either reinforcing the idea that we're all  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:37):**  separate or that we're all connected and everyone can make a statement along their own personal  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:41):**  edge.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:42):**  And frankly, I think that's how the world is going to change.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:44):**  It's two small acts that aggregate into a larger change.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:49):**  But it isn't just that project inspiring things.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:53):**  It's, I mean, it's inspired politicians to make policy changes.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:57):**  It's inspired bureaucrats to become sympathetic and redirect transportation routes.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:03):**  Like the bike, the bike route system comes close to that project in order to, you know,  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:08):**  let people come visit that.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:10):**  So that's a small project, but it's gigantic in its impact.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:13):**  And it's actually a huge project because it was never about the thing.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:17):**  It was always about the consciousness of people.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:20):**  So I'm talking about something small, but it's really quite gigantic.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:23):**  Okay.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:24):**  Then there's actually overtly gigantic things.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:27):**  Like lately we've been working on climate resilience projects and worked on a team to  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:34):**  redesign the entire watershed of Islais Creek, which is the majority of San Francisco, and  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:38):**  turn the urban sewer system into a water catchment system.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:43):**  So instead of trying to get rid of rain runoff and domestic and, you know, commercial and  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:49):**  institutional effluent to instead install upstream intervention systems, black water  
**[0:45:55-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:55):**  and gray water systems everywhere, and then basically recreate all domestic and institutional  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:04):**  commercial landscapes and public right-of-ways so that we're catching and absorbing water  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:09):**  and storing water by millions and millions of gallons in order to address the climate  
**[0:46:15-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:15):**  emergency, the extended drought in California, to capture all of this biomass and use it  
**[0:46:22-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:22):**  instead to regenerate landscapes and sequester carbon.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:26):**  And so giant systemic change projects, in that case funded by the Rockefeller Foundation,  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:34):**  they've been inspired after the Sandy Hurricane to realize the climate change is desperately  
**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:38):**  real and we've gotten to engage as permaculturists with them being specifically interested in  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:46):**  what a permaculture team could contribute.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:50):**  So I don't know, that's huge on design scales.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:53):**  That's supposed to be driven.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:56):**  I'm so glad to hear that those types of organizations are taking a real look and putting money down  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:02):**  on infrastructure projects that actually work towards regeneration and resilience rather  
**[0:47:07-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:07):**  than sort of putting the project or the issue onto somebody else's plate or just getting  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:16):**  rid of it, starting to look at these as resources rather than destructive forces if managed  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:21):**  properly.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:22):**  Yeah, it was very heartening.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:24):**  At the same time, it was beginning to see that there was this bright light shining from  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:32):**  within the context of Rockefeller in connection to city administrations.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:38):**  It was also very sobering because as we traveled around the Bay Area, we basically traveled  
**[0:47:46-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:46):**  for, I think, six weeks around the Bay Area meeting administrators and visiting different  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:54):**  communities and Rockefeller was having us do workshops with all these climate scientists  
**[0:48:01-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:01):**  and different specialists.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:04):**  We kept learning things from specialists that just somehow wasn't being absorbed and integrated  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:11):**  by political leadership or bureaucracies.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:15):**  So for instance, we would go from a workshop in the morning with Klaus Jacobs, who's like  
**[0:48:20-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:20):**  the Einstein of climate scientists, and he's saying to us in the morning, this whole thing,  
**[0:48:26-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:26):**  this whole sea level rise danger can go as high as 200 feet.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:34):**  And then in the afternoon, we're visiting Silicon Valley and listening to their elected  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:40):**  leadership saying, we're going to hold the line here.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:42):**  We're going to build a three foot levee.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:44):**  We're going to stop climate change right here.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:48):**  And I remember all of these architects and planners on all these teams.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:55):**  And they're, for the most part, really uncomfortable asking questions like reconciling the difference  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:02):**  between what they heard in the morning and what they're seeing in the afternoon.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:05):**  So I'm always having to stand out like a sore thumb permaculturist asking uncomfortable  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:10):**  questions.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:11):**  So I said to the administrator, well, you know, we just heard from our advisors that  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:16):**  the problem is going to go at least 200 feet.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:20):**  And no, no, it could go as high as 200 feet.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:23):**  And supposedly, if it goes 10 feet, it will destabilize so much about the economy and  
**[0:49:30-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:30):**  political and political culture, that the next 190 feet will just happen without any  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:39):**  ability to stop it.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:41):**  So I was like, you know, you guys must be hearing some of this.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:44):**  I mean, if you don't talk about it in the open, at least when you're having beers together  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:49):**  after work as friends, do you talk about this stuff?  
**[0:49:53-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:53):**  This administrator is just looking at me like I'm a space alien.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:56):**  And he's like, you know, no, we don't talk about it.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:00):**  So everywhere we went, one of the things that we were learning is that on one hand, the  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:07):**  Rockefeller Foundation representatives are saying to us, you know, the Bay Area is our  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:12):**  greatest hope, because it has the most ability to have political consensus.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:19):**  And it has the most diversity of people and geographic, kind of urban circumstances and  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:25):**  landform.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:26):**  So we can provide prototypes for people all over the world.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:29):**  And on the other hand, then we're out in the afternoon learning that, yeah, there's some  
**[0:50:33-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:33):**  amount of political, you know, kind of inclination in the Bay, but wholly unprepared in terms  
**[0:50:42-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:42):**  of facts, and any kind of grasp on the scope of the problem.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:49):**  So it was an illuminating process.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:53):**  I'm really glad for it.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:54):**  I'm totally tooled up to work on projects of this kind.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:58):**  But at the same time, it was sobering.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:02):**  Yeah, it would seem.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:05):**  Now, one of the things that I know that you've explored with your teams and such is the problem  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:10):**  of displaced people within this country, and many of them refer to them as homeless people.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:16):**  You've worked with homeless communities and development of bringing dignity back to these  
**[0:51:21-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:21):**  settlements, as this becomes an increasingly big problem, especially in our urban areas.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:28):**  Can you give me some insights on what you've learned in the process of trying to understand  
**[0:51:33-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:33):**  how this problem continues to evolve in our country?  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:39):**  And what are some of the solutions or at least hopes that you found in infrastructure that  
**[0:51:44-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:44):**  can include all people?  
**[0:51:46-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:46):**  Well, speaking of all people, I was in Denver, I was in Boulder a couple years ago, and working  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:56):**  with homeless people there and doing some design charrettes for house-less villages,  
**[0:52:02-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:02):**  tiny home villages.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:03):**  This is a project I've been working on since 1999, so 20 years into this, really working  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:09):**  hard on replicating.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:12):**  You used the word dignity.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:14):**  Our first village was named Dignity Village, and it's still going strong and has been providing  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:20):**  assistance to communities all over the country to be able to create similar prototypes.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:26):**  So it's very exciting.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:28):**  But when I was in Denver, I heard from a homeless person speaking at an event that Howard Einstein's  
**[0:52:38-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:38):**  granddaughter is a homeless person living in Denver.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:42):**  And you hear something like that, and it's like, okay, how much more convincing do people  
**[0:52:50-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:50):**  need to understand that this is really an economic issue?  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:58):**  It's very complex.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:59):**  It's very complex.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:00):**  But I think it's too easy for people to continue to do this same stuff about marginalizing  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:07):**  people based on their projections, that people are too lazy or they just don't want to work  
**[0:53:12-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:12):**  or they have a mental health problem.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:15):**  In the case of Einstein's granddaughter, probably she's wandering around sitting there having  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:20):**  epiphanies about the relationship of light and space, and she can't be bothered to get  
**[0:53:26-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:26):**  a job at 7-Eleven because she's too busy counting stars or something.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:30):**  Seriously, in my work over these last 20 years, I have met so many brilliant people who probably  
**[0:53:37-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:37):**  would not be living in the streets if they lived in a society that would embrace them  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:41):**  for their qualities and their talents.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:44):**  I've also met people who won't suffer the indignity of trading their time for money  
**[0:53:52-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:52):**  because life is too interesting.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:53):**  So I've met people who are intensely artistic and they live outside.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:59):**  I'm just going to give you a bunch of different thoughts.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:02):**  I mean, Oregon Public Broadcasting, National Public Radio ran a series a couple of years  
**[0:54:08-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:08):**  ago on the surprising percentage of people who have nomadic ancestry that live out in  
**[0:54:15-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:15):**  the streets.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:17):**  When I heard this series, I was thinking about that story in the Bible, which is basically  
**[0:54:25-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:25):**  just this allegory about the conflict between the rise of the city-state and colonialism  
**[0:54:32-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:32):**  and its hostility toward all things local, all local cultures.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:36):**  So Cain, whose name basically means city-state, kills his brother, Abel, whose name basically  
**[0:54:43-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:43):**  means nomad.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:45):**  What we have is this hostility toward the ephemeral, toward alternative forms of culture.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:53):**  And colonialism basically needs everyone to be nailed down to ground to pay for their  
**[0:54:58-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:58):**  space to fund the society.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:01):**  And we basically outlawed an entire paradigm on a way of being.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:05):**  A lot of people out in the streets apparently have a proclivity for being nomadic.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:10):**  And we're telling them that they have nowhere, there's no ground for them to sleep in the  
**[0:55:14-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:14):**  world, simply because we've decided to outlaw the very phenomena of being nomadic.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:20):**  This is so profoundly unjust, so profoundly ignorant and criminal.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:25):**  And it's just one aspect of homelessness, just one dimension of the conversation.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:31):**  Isn't that a thought in my mind?  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:33):**  It's as complex as each individual.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:35):**  Truly, truly.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:38):**  Who knows why Einstein's grand-mother and grand-daughter would be homeless?  
**[0:55:43-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:43):**  Who knows what's happening in her life to make this happen?  
**[0:55:49-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:49):**  And you know, as I've been working on this and meeting people personally, it goes from  
**[0:55:52-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:52):**  being a conceptual project where I'm doing it for different reasons, like, gosh, all  
**[0:55:57-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:57):**  of these houses villages are prototyped for carbon reduction, how exciting.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:02):**  For me as a design nerd, one of the biggest motivations is I get to just relish this experience  
**[0:56:10-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:10):**  of regenerating urban form over and over again, and witnessing the playing out of settlement  
**[0:56:17-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:17):**  patterns, which is one of the most...  
**[0:56:19-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:19):**  People think that, you know, when they think about design, they think about forms and objects  
**[0:56:23-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:23):**  and products and architecture.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:25):**  The ultimate design is to witness people collaborating together to create urban form, to create settlement  
**[0:56:33-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:33):**  patterns that, like, evidence how they move in space and how they relate to each other,  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:39):**  how they respond to climate and light, to wind and rain, and then alchemize the material  
**[0:56:45-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:45):**  around them into a habitat where they find shelter.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:49):**  That's the ultimate gig for human design.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:52):**  And, you know, that's what we mean by permaculture, of course, but we rarely think of it in terms  
**[0:56:57-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:57):**  of urban form because permaculturists mostly focus, you know, on domestic systems and planting  
**[0:57:04-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:04):**  guilds and things like that, but it applies to all scales.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:07):**  I don't know, thinking about homelessness, I'm learning constantly.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:12):**  Like the other day, there was an article released on the internet.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:18):**  There was a study done, I think in Portland, on that for every $100 average increase in  
**[0:57:25-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:25):**  rent across the city, homelessness increases by 15%.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:31):**  That is not...  
**[0:57:32-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:32):**  Oh, God.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:33):**  Do you...  
**[0:57:34-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:34):**  No, it isn't.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:35):**  Like, that tells us.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:36):**  And here's another thing related to that.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:39):**  When I was in Oakland a couple of years ago doing a workshop on colonialism and gentrification,  
**[0:57:46-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:46):**  I learned from one of the participants and economists that the more that we allow...  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:53):**  This is like, this is something to really, really take into consideration and give a  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:59):**  lot of thought to.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:00):**  The more we allow the economic disparity to grow, the more that we have people amassing  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:06):**  wealth whose only interest in wealth is more wealth.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:11):**  And wealthy people tend to keep so much of it available, just so much of it available  
**[0:58:17-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:17):**  for them to be able to use that's fluid.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:20):**  For the most part, they bank it in investments.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:25):**  Investments most often take the form of some kind of real estate development.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:30):**  So if you have all of this cash out there that needs to be invested in order to make  
**[0:58:34-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:34):**  more money, it causes the acceleration of gentrification because you're basically building  
**[0:58:40-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:40):**  all of these market rate housing units in order to provide an increasing return on investment.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:47):**  So the more we allow the disparity to grow, the faster gentrification accelerates.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:53):**  And all of that, of course, contributes tremendously to homelessness.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:59):**  We have a madness going on right now.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:02):**  I think one of the anecdotes is for people to realize that people in the streets, all  
**[0:59:08-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:08):**  around them, are maybe one or two degrees removed from them in terms of relationships.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:14):**  I have actually experienced that.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:18):**  I've actually met people that are the children of my father's and mother's own friends, people  
**[0:59:25-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:25):**  that I went to school with, but then I meet who are out in the streets.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:30):**  And I learned something that happened to them in the course of their lives that I was close  
**[0:59:34-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:34):**  to myself and I didn't realize what had happened to them.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:38):**  I've seen people run into each other in a car and get mad at each other in my own neighborhood  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:44):**  and start to fight, only to be pulled apart by their wives saying things like, don't you  
**[0:59:50-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:50):**  realize who you are?  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:51):**  You guys used to be friends in school.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:55):**  But they're so far from remembering each other because of isolation or lack of continuity  
**[1:00:01-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:01):**  in their lives that they don't even realize that they just finally had a chance to meet  
**[1:00:05-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:05):**  their old friend.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:06):**  Unfortunately, it took a car accident to do it.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:09):**  I'm going on and on about paradox here, but I think fundamentally for us to look at other  
**[1:00:15-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:15):**  people out in the street and just call them mere homeless people and treat them as if  
**[1:00:18-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:18):**  they're invisible pariahs or something is a terrible, terrible state of mind for us  
**[1:00:25-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:25):**  all.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:26):**  It's not just terrible for the homeless people.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:27):**  For us to walk around in such ignorance, being oblivious to our fundamental connection to  
**[1:00:31-1:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:31):**  other people around us and all that we share.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:36):**  I swear, even if they're homeless and you got a home, you're still cultural refugees.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:40):**  I think the fact that you're even alive in the 21st century is a testament to your resilience  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:46):**  that you've survived through all of these convolutions of human history.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:50):**  I would rather walk around appreciating the fact that we're still here, that projecting  
**[1:00:55-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:55):**  onto each other and saying, oh, you're of a lesser class because you have less than  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:59):**  me.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:00):**  That's like playing life as if it's a monopoly board game or something.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:05):**  I love that you reminded me that we're only maybe one, perhaps two steps removed from  
**[1:01:10-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:10):**  people of a situation of homelessness.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:13):**  I was reminded of this recently when there was an emergency in my family and one of my  
**[1:01:18-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:18):**  brothers had to go to the hospital.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:20):**  Now it wasn't terribly major and he got out of there just fine, but realizing that he  
**[1:01:25-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:25):**  doesn't have health insurance and a simple ambulance ride could put him into enough debt  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:31):**  that he couldn't pay his rent.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:34):**  So many people these days are a very slim financial fall from having their entire livelihoods  
**[1:01:43-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:43):**  at risk.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:45):**  Goodness knows it's like that in so many other parts of the world as well.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:48):**  As we become more and more disconnected from our communities, we also disconnect from our  
**[1:01:54-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:54):**  systems of support.  
**[1:01:56-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:56):**  And so few people know their neighbors.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:59):**  I realized in that emergency that we weren't terribly far from home without a phone to  
**[1:02:06-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:06):**  make a call or, you know, like I don't have any phone numbers memorized in my head anymore.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:14):**  And I couldn't tell you the phone number of the neighbors or some of the close friends  
**[1:02:19-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:19):**  of many of the people that I visited.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:21):**  You know, we've removed ourselves from having that as a part of us and have outsourced it  
**[1:02:26-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:26):**  to our electronic devices, which if those go like, I mean, anybody listening to this  
**[1:02:31-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:31):**  now, how many phone numbers, how many addresses do you have memorized anymore?  
**[1:02:35-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:35):**  You know, who could you reach out to if you didn't have an electronic connection like  
**[1:02:39-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:39):**  that?  
**[1:02:40-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:40):**  And I think it's very important to remember that we are not so much different from people  
**[1:02:44-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:44):**  of those situations.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:46):**  And perhaps one or two unfortunate circumstances could put us there as well.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:50):**  And definitely for me has helped to reconnect an amount of sympathy and compassion for people  
**[1:02:56-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:56):**  in those situations.  
**[1:02:57-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:57):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:58):**  Well, here's another thought related to that.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:02):**  If we don't sit there using our brains to file away phone numbers or addresses or to  
**[1:03:10-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:10):**  be able to calculate basic math problems, it becomes an atrophy function of our mind.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:18):**  I mean, I'm not saying that, you know, like we were biologically evolved to remember phone  
**[1:03:25-1:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:25):**  numbers specifically, but we have evolved with this intense capacity, incredible capacity  
**[1:03:33-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:33):**  for pattern observation and for integration of lots and lots and lots and lots and lots  
**[1:03:40-1:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:40):**  of detailed information.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:41):**  And the more that we outsource that to remote systems that we interact with, with the push  
**[1:03:48-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:48):**  of a button, I think the stupider we become.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:50):**  You know, frankly, we also know that if your mind is not engaged in complex exercises,  
**[1:03:58-1:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:58):**  you become susceptible early in your life to things like dementia and Alzheimer's.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:03):**  So there's a lot of motivations for actually doing it.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:06):**  But you know, I do that kind of stuff for an aesthetic experience.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:12):**  I don't want to not know things.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:14):**  Sure.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:15):**  It's kind of weird to me.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:17):**  I'll be in a meeting and someone will, there'll be some sort of need to understand something  
**[1:04:26-1:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:26):**  and I'll calculate it in my mind right there.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:30):**  And I'll say, oh, well, it's this number.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:33):**  And what's approximately this number.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:36):**  Or I'll remember a phone number and someone, some younger person will just be shocked that  
**[1:04:40-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:40):**  I can.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:41):**  I'm really glad to be old enough to remember, you know, rotary phones, times before cell  
**[1:04:49-1:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:49):**  phones, times before computers, because it really gives you context.  
**[1:04:54-1:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:54):**  I feel really scared for people who haven't known life before these systems.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:00):**  Well, I found it really useful because I mean, I don't remember some of those things that  
**[1:05:04-1:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:04):**  you've mentioned, but I remember like cassette tapes and dialing phone numbers that you had  
**[1:05:09-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:09):**  to remember in your head.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:10):**  And for nothing else, I think it just serves to remind us that before all of the convenience  
**[1:05:17-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:17):**  of technology that most of us enjoy and rely on now, people were fine.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:22):**  Like life went on and we didn't have to be connected in the way that we are now to live  
**[1:05:28-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:28):**  richly.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:29):**  And so I like to, you know, from my experience, practice other ways of living occasionally  
**[1:05:34-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:34):**  to make sure that I could still do without it if I had to.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:37):**  But I actually want to read this to a couple of subjects that kind of are coalescing here.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:44):**  And you've talked about this idea of becoming people of place or reindigenizing ourselves.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:50):**  And I had a previous conversation with Bill Reed, who is one of the co-founders of the  
**[1:05:55-1:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:55):**  LEAD Building Certification Systems and one of the principles at the Regenesis Network.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:01):**  And he talked about him.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:03):**  Yeah, he also talked a lot about understanding the story of a place before starting to do  
**[1:06:09-1:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:09):**  any kind of design or make suggestions on a project.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:13):**  And I know through your work, this is something that you put a lot of effort into it, understanding  
**[1:06:18-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:18):**  the story of the place and the context in which you're working before you start to put  
**[1:06:23-1:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:23):**  pen to paper.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:25):**  And so I guess the question would be, what is like, how do you first start to gather  
**[1:06:31-1:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:31):**  information?  
**[1:06:32-1:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:32):**  What do you look to inform you as to what is the story of the place and the context  
**[1:06:38-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:38):**  that you're working in before you start to design?  
**[1:06:41-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:41):**  Great question.  
**[1:06:43-1:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:43):**  Jeez.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:44):**  Okay.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:45):**  Well, a lot of times, even if I'm not asked to show up and help with a design project,  
**[1:06:53-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:53):**  this is something I'm always doing as I move through the city or something.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:00):**  I'll just stop and stand and I will feel, I will listen.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:06):**  And I don't try to necessarily hear words or get specific images.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:12):**  I just stop and let my body and my ears, my mind feel and sense and let it come into me.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:22):**  And then I know it will integrate itself.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:24):**  The information will integrate in me and then come out as an expression.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:30):**  So, you know, I would say that that's a permaculture behavior.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:36):**  It's not specifically outlined in any manual, except to say that you, you know, you, you  
**[1:07:41-1:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:41):**  practice thoughtful and protect protracted observations, but the observation, you know,  
**[1:07:47-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:47):**  that I do with my eyes and my body, walking cases, noticing slope, paying attention to  
**[1:07:55-1:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:55):**  the direction of the wind or the orientation of the sun.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:59):**  I do that, but I also just stand and I feel and I listen because I figure, even though  
**[1:08:04-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:04):**  I don't particularly believe in anything per se, in a mystical and spiritual way, I also  
**[1:08:12-1:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:12):**  know that there's more going on than I can understand.  
**[1:08:16-1:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:16):**  So I don't, I don't, I don't use belief.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:19):**  I don't know, it sounds paradoxical, perhaps, but I know things are going on beyond any  
**[1:08:25-1:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:25):**  sort of scale and depth that I can actually decipher.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:30):**  And at the same time, I don't specifically ground myself in one interpretation of how  
**[1:08:36-1:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:36):**  it's all working.  
**[1:08:39-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:39):**  So I'll just sit there and sense.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:41):**  Sometimes I'm sensing ancestors or descendants who are, you know, I am, I'm like, wow, I  
**[1:08:50-1:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:50):**  kind of get a sense of people being back in time, blowing kisses forward into now, like  
**[1:08:57-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:57):**  wishing us luck or people from the past encouraging us to do our best and try as hard as we can  
**[1:09:03-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:03):**  because of how things turned out in the future.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:06):**  So I'm on a site doing a design.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:08):**  I'm doing, I do that.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:11):**  I just stand in it and I listen and I just try to absorb it without interpreting it mentally.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:18):**  And then I let it come through in the insights I have as I'm working with people to work  
**[1:09:24-1:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:24):**  on a design.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:25):**  And even then I'm listening, constantly listening and I'm listening acutely to other people.  
**[1:09:31-1:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:31):**  You know, the other people that are working with me on a project, they might not be as  
**[1:09:36-1:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:36):**  practiced at listening.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:37):**  So it's very important for them to know whether they're practiced or not.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:41):**  Everyone needs to know that they're heard.  
**[1:09:43-1:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:43):**  So I'm constantly practicing a kind of a social technology or a social architecture of being  
**[1:09:50-1:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:50):**  receptive and inclusive.  
**[1:09:53-1:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:53):**  And you know, they're thinking that I'm being the leader, but what they don't maybe understand  
**[1:09:58-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:58):**  yet is my way of leading is to summarize, you know, to let everyone talk and say all  
**[1:10:04-1:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:04):**  the things that I would probably say anyway, but to let them say it.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:08):**  And then I'm listening for what doesn't get heard.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:11):**  So as I'm standing in a group, you know, there's plenty of intelligence there.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:15):**  So they'll be talking about the direction of the wind or they'll be talking about the  
**[1:10:18-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:18):**  slope.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:20):**  And I'm not there to try to correct anyone.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:22):**  But if I hear people, you know, kind of not seeing something, you know, I might, you know,  
**[1:10:28-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:28):**  ask them a question that helps them to see it.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:31):**  I try not to be editing other people.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:34):**  But I'm just there to listen.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:35):**  And the more that I listen, the richer I get.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:38):**  The more I listen, the more I actually hear.  
**[1:10:42-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:42):**  Before I was a good listener, there was so much that I wasn't hearing.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:45):**  So I think, you know, practicing observation of my own feelings as I'm in that interaction.  
**[1:10:53-1:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:53):**  So I guess I'm starting a kind of a sort of a deeper way of having insight here.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:58):**  But I absolutely agree with Bill.  
**[1:11:02-1:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:02):**  This wouldn't necessarily make sense to some clients who aren't interested in respecting  
**[1:11:09-1:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:09):**  what has happened there.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:10):**  But I think it's to people's detriment to not care.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:15):**  I mean, for one thing, physically, you need to like maybe you're on a landscape where  
**[1:11:19-1:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:19):**  everything's kind of been just wiped out.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:22):**  It seems as if it's all been wiped out.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:23):**  They wiped out the vegetation, they removed the fauna, they've erased the cultural patterns  
**[1:11:29-1:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:29):**  from before.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:30):**  So it doesn't really matter to look at what was there before.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:33):**  Let's just build something new.  
**[1:11:35-1:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:35):**  Well, that kind of approach leads to things like sinkholes coming out of nowhere because  
**[1:11:41-1:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:41):**  you didn't bother to realize that in the violence that happened on the land, ways that water  
**[1:11:47-1:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:47):**  used to move has been obscured.  
**[1:11:50-1:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:50):**  Like you've filled a bunch of land where water used to flow.  
**[1:11:53-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:53):**  Well, it's still flowing under that land.  
**[1:11:56-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:56):**  You might put in a parking lot or a building and then have the parking lot or building  
**[1:12:00-1:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:00):**  fall into a hole because you didn't bother to find out that there's actually a stream  
**[1:12:05-1:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:05):**  flowing there.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:06):**  And besides, it really matters if there had been a village there.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:11):**  You're building on bones, you're building on sacred gathering places.  
**[1:12:16-1:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:16):**  You need to understand what's there.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:18):**  It might affect you spiritually.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:21):**  Probably would affect you spiritually, especially if you, at the fun end, if you don't care,  
**[1:12:27-1:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:27):**  then not being a caring person who doesn't bother to know the story of a place is going  
**[1:12:32-1:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:32):**  to make you have a much less rich experience and you'll be more prone to make stupid choices  
**[1:12:37-1:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:37):**  in the rest of your life.  
**[1:12:40-1:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:40):**  So for the sake of one's own richness, and I say this to developers frequently, like  
**[1:12:45-1:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:45):**  what is your legacy?  
**[1:12:47-1:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:47):**  Is all that you care about like going in, tearing down forests, building something and  
**[1:12:52-1:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:52):**  then cashing out?  
**[1:12:54-1:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:54):**  Because you can't take it with you.  
**[1:12:56-1:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:56):**  You know, you have the opportunity to build a legacy and it won't cost you anymore.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:00):**  We'll have a richer experience and people will actually like you.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:05):**  Like how do you lose in that equation?  
**[1:13:09-1:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:09):**  So caring about what it used to be is a fundamental way of, you know, connecting to the meaning  
**[1:13:15-1:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:15):**  in your own life, not even to start talking about the sustainability of a project.  
**[1:13:22-1:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:22):**  So I think Bill's absolutely right.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:24):**  And he's talking about all the same things I am when I say all those things.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:28):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:29):**  I mean, at this point, part of my job is just to see the similarities, the connectivities  
**[1:13:33-1:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:33):**  in these conversations that hopefully create a pattern that someone can suss out of the  
**[1:13:38-1:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:38):**  larger body of work that this creates.  
**[1:13:41-1:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:41):**  And certainly of people who have more experience and have been doing this longer, I've noticed  
**[1:13:46-1:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:46):**  that they really shy away from giving specific advice about techniques or design methodologies.  
**[1:13:54-1:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:54):**  And they really focus on all of them talking about putting in the time to listen and to  
**[1:14:00-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:00):**  observe, almost to a T, like everybody who I really look up to and who has been doing  
**[1:14:04-1:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:04):**  this for any period of time.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:06):**  That's the most common thread that I've noticed from their advice.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:12):**  Now, before we wrap it up, this is something that I'm starting to ask more and more people.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:17):**  And I would imagine that you're going to have a good answer with all of these challenges  
**[1:14:22-1:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:22):**  and seemingly insurmountable, I guess, issues of our time.  
**[1:14:29-1:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:29):**  What keeps you going personally?  
**[1:14:32-1:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:32):**  I know that when we spoke last, you had just become a father and two years on, you've got  
**[1:14:37-1:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:37):**  a two year old kid and that's a big part of your life.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:40):**  Is that one of the biggest influences and what motivates you moving forward?  
**[1:14:44-1:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:44):**  Or is there a larger sort of, I guess, motivation behind what you do?  
**[1:14:49-1:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:49):**  Well, having a really brilliant little two year old daughter is like a lightning bolt  
**[1:14:57-1:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:57):**  of beauty and inspiration that kind of shocks through everything that's going on, even the  
**[1:15:07-1:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:07):**  sort of fascist political insurgency that we see kind of trying to rise around the world.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:15):**  For me, on a personal level, she cuts right through that in terms of making me laugh and  
**[1:15:21-1:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:21):**  smile.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:22):**  But it also, you know, that pretty quickly turns to heartbreak too, because I'm struggling  
**[1:15:31-1:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:31):**  to try to understand how or imagine how I am going to dovetail her innocence into an  
**[1:15:38-1:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:38):**  awareness of the state of the world.  
**[1:15:42-1:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:42):**  She's, she heard this term strong woman, she keeps running around saying, I am a strong  
**[1:15:47-1:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:47):**  woman and then declaring what she can accomplish.  
**[1:15:53-1:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:53):**  So yeah, I know she's here to help.  
**[1:15:56-1:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:56):**  I'm pretty sure that's why she's here.  
**[1:15:59-1:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:59):**  So she's helping me a lot.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:01):**  I've got a lot of help.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:03):**  I've had, I'm really lucky to have had kind of activist and artist mentors through my  
**[1:16:09-1:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:09):**  life that have always helped me to see that that challenges our creative opportunity.  
**[1:16:17-1:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:17):**  We certainly have the greatest creative opportunity plethora of compounding creative opportunities  
**[1:16:23-1:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:23):**  more than we could have ever asked for, you know, happening in our time.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:28):**  But that's, it's both, you know, sort of heart rending and exciting at the same time.  
**[1:16:35-1:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:35):**  Like we've never been quite as globalized.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:38):**  There hasn't been as much, you know, like mutual understanding.  
**[1:16:41-1:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:41):**  For some people, it comes in the form of, you know, noticing that there's a lot of Thai  
**[1:16:46-1:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:46):**  restaurants around and Mexican food where before there were only hamburger joints.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:51):**  And you're, you know, you're seeing that there's this kind of cross-pollinization of culture,  
**[1:16:58-1:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:58):**  whether it's literally represented by immigrants or people who have traveled to other countries  
**[1:17:02-1:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:02):**  and found an appreciation.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:04):**  Sometimes it starts just by being able to taste each other's, you know, culinary traditions.  
**[1:17:12-1:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:12):**  But there's so many other different ways and expressions where people have been coming  
**[1:17:15-1:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:15):**  into contact and the world is starting to understand more about its story and whether  
**[1:17:20-1:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:20):**  that's through genetics or the beneficial aspects of archaeology and history and learning  
**[1:17:27-1:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:27):**  so much about what we've been going through.  
**[1:17:29-1:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:29):**  And so I think we're in a really portentous time, you know, and all of that, of course,  
**[1:17:35-1:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:35):**  is threatening to the supremacist culture that has been persisting for so long and presenting  
**[1:17:43-1:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:43):**  us with so many of these challenges, really challenges by design.  
**[1:17:47-1:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:47):**  I have to say, now that I know, I know that most of the problems we have in our society  
**[1:17:53-1:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:53):**  are not, like we're always saying things like, oh, I'm only human.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:59):**  I think that's missing, that's really missing the point.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:02):**  To be a human being, yeah, we're imperfect and we're failed and I love to understand,  
**[1:18:07-1:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:07):**  you know, I give myself a break all the time by knowing that really as a human being, I  
**[1:18:13-1:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:13):**  have to really see everything as an experiment and I have to be ready to make a lot of mistakes.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:18):**  But not to get down on myself about that and to understand our creative proclivities are  
**[1:18:24-1:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:24):**  really in some ways kind of divine-like, like to be able to express the way that we do and  
**[1:18:33-1:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:33):**  to be able to take challenges and turn them into cultural evolution is an incredible,  
**[1:18:39-1:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:39):**  incredible capacity that we have.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:42):**  Yeah, but the thing I was going to say that I've realized is that really all of our problems  
**[1:18:49-1:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:49):**  are a consequence of design choices that people make.  
**[1:18:54-1:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:54):**  The oligarch class has created homelessness.  
**[1:18:57-1:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:57):**  The oligarch class has been misogynistic from the beginning.  
**[1:19:00-1:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:00):**  They create a context where domestic violence can thrive, you know, basically, you know,  
**[1:19:06-1:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:06):**  based upon taking men and turning them against their own families to make them dominators  
**[1:19:11-1:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:11):**  or to turn them against their own communities and make them capitalizers.  
**[1:19:16-1:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:16):**  These systems aren't accidental and they end up making the people who think that they're  
**[1:19:20-1:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:20):**  profiting off of it the most crazy and the most miserable of all.  
**[1:19:25-1:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:25):**  So you know, I understand that as a designer.  
**[1:19:29-1:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:29):**  I just hope that we figure out a way to address these design issues in time so that we can  
**[1:19:35-1:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:35):**  continue into the future.  
**[1:19:37-1:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:37):**  And I'm excited by the challenge even as my heart is breaking because of all of the unnecessary  
**[1:19:43-1:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:43):**  pain.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:45):**  But here's like another piece of the answer to your question.  
**[1:19:48-1:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:48):**  I've gone out and I literally have asked people what is wrong with my country and what is  
**[1:19:52-1:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:52):**  wrong with me.  
**[1:19:54-1:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:54):**  And what I've got is the most beautiful, like empathetic sisterhood and brotherhood back  
**[1:19:59-1:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:59):**  in return.  
**[1:20:02-1:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:02):**  One time I was in a Mayan village and I was like, can you tell me what is wrong with me?  
**[1:20:06-1:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:06):**  Can you tell me what is wrong with my country?  
**[1:20:08-1:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:08):**  And they're like, first of all, you need to realize, like I'm sitting there apologizing  
**[1:20:13-1:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:13):**  for basically European invasion and this person's like, no, you cannot take this upon yourselves.  
**[1:20:19-1:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:19):**  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  
**[1:20:21-1:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:21):**  Look at what Europe has done to this place.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:23):**  Look at what we have done.  
**[1:20:24-1:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:24):**  And he's like, no, you only did this to us because it was done to you so long ago.  
**[1:20:30-1:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:30):**  You don't even know who you are anymore.  
**[1:20:33-1:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:33):**  Your people don't know who you are.  
**[1:20:35-1:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:35):**  You don't remember the villages that were destroyed.  
**[1:20:37-1:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:37):**  You don't know that you were attacked and subsumed.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:40):**  You were turned into people who would go out and attack other people at the cost of your  
**[1:20:44-1:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:44):**  own humanity and experience of family.  
**[1:20:49-1:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:49):**  And I'm sitting there crying.  
**[1:20:51-1:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:51):**  I can't even believe the kind of love that this person is giving back to me and all this  
**[1:20:55-1:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:55):**  understanding.  
**[1:20:56-1:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:56):**  Then he explains the colonial grid and he says, go back home to where you grew up and  
**[1:21:01-1:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:01):**  stand in a street intersection.  
**[1:21:04-1:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:04):**  Look at all the lines that are so flat and straight and see how this is a huge design  
**[1:21:09-1:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:09):**  construct city by city, everywhere people are isolated by.  
**[1:21:16-1:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:16):**  So yeah, I got to have an insight on the way that design can sometimes be monumental and  
**[1:21:23-1:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:23):**  enormous in the sweeping scale of ambition to control, to eliminate cultures and replace  
**[1:21:34-1:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:34):**  them with a giant kind of development concept that just will benefit the few.  
**[1:21:41-1:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:41):**  So I guess you asked me what keeps me going.  
**[1:21:46-1:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:46):**  Part of it is outrage.  
**[1:21:47-1:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:47):**  Like I see that we're, every one of us, including rich people are swept up in something so big  
**[1:21:53-1:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:53):**  we no longer understand it.  
**[1:21:54-1:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:54):**  And it's so painful to us, maybe especially rich people because they ended up being impoverished  
**[1:22:00-1:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:00):**  spiritually, but it's beyond comprehension and it's tragedy is beyond our ability to  
**[1:22:07-1:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:07):**  grasp.  
**[1:22:08-1:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:08):**  So there's that, I'm motivated by that.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:11):**  And on the other hand, on the other side of the tragedy, and this is something that this  
**[1:22:15-1:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:15):**  same Mayan person said to me, he held up his hands like this side of my palm is everything  
**[1:22:20-1:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:20):**  that's wrong that obscures us from seeing what's on the other side of my palm.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:24):**  And he turns his hand around and he's like on this side is to see the luminous reality  
**[1:22:29-1:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:29):**  that we are on a floating garden sphere.  
**[1:22:33-1:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:33):**  The only life that we know of in all the cosmos is here.  
**[1:22:38-1:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:38):**  This is home.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:39):**  We are home.  
**[1:22:40-1:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:40):**  We are all home together.  
**[1:22:42-1:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:42):**  And if we can see that everything is here and that everything that we need is provided  
**[1:22:46-1:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:46):**  for to us as a gift and an expression of love, if we can see that we are all leaves on the  
**[1:22:52-1:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:52):**  tree of life and somehow act from a place of seeing our larger self with each other,  
**[1:22:57-1:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:57):**  then we will be okay and we will thrive.  
**[1:23:02-1:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:02):**  And to like glimpse, you know, the possibility of actually inhabiting that awareness and  
**[1:23:07-1:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:07):**  taking care of each other and going to new levels of aesthetic appreciation and experience  
**[1:23:13-1:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:13):**  with each other like that, however, that's what's keeping me going is to see what's on  
**[1:23:18-1:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:18):**  the other side of all of this despair is all of this like promise, birthright.  
**[1:23:27-1:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:27):**  That inspires me constantly.  
**[1:23:29-1:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:29):**  All the way till I'm dust, I'll be inspired by that because I already know that stuff.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:33):**  Like, oh my God, we live in the most amazing place.  
**[1:23:37-1:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:37):**  That gets me up every morning.  
**[1:23:38-1:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:38):**  Even the tragedy.  
**[1:23:39-1:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:39):**  That's the thing.  
**[1:23:40-1:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:40):**  Like we go to Mars, sifting through dust, looking for one organic molecule, you know,  
**[1:23:45-1:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:45):**  and then we come back here and we're like, all around us, we're surrounded by evidence  
**[1:23:52-1:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:52):**  of the miraculous.  
**[1:23:54-1:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:54):**  And I feel that pretty much every day.  
**[1:23:57-1:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:57):**  It's it's it would be a hell of a lot better.  
**[1:23:58-1:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:58):**  There's billions of us were seeing that together because that cumulative celebration would  
**[1:24:05-1:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:05):**  be the best thing we ever experienced.  
**[1:24:09-1:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:09):**  So that keeps me going to have that with each other.  
**[1:24:12-1:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:12):**  Well said.  
**[1:24:13-1:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:13):**  Yeah, I, I deeply resonate with that.  
**[1:24:17-1:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:17):**  I really like the way that you put it.  
**[1:24:20-1:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:20):**  And I think it's a marvelous transition now to have you tell our listeners on that note,  
**[1:24:26-1:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:26):**  how they can get in touch with you or your organizations and learn more about your work.  
**[1:24:30-1:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:30):**  Sure.  
**[1:24:31-1:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:31):**  Okay, well, you know, there's different websites.  
**[1:24:34-1:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:34):**  I think the best thing to do is to come to Portland, invite you all to Portland at the  
**[1:24:40-1:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:40):**  end of May in the beginning of June for our 10 day annual gigantic permaculture barn raising  
**[1:24:47-1:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:47):**  called the village building convergence that happens every year.  
**[1:24:51-1:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:51):**  It'll happen next year for 10 days and come to Portland and see how sort of like 40 simultaneous  
**[1:24:59-1:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:59):**  projects can happen over the course of 10 days and everyone's organizing it themselves  
**[1:25:04-1:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:04):**  and revolutionizing their, their, their, their environments as expressions of urban permaculture.  
**[1:25:09-1:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:09):**  So come be a part of that.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:11):**  And we actually have a school during that time.  
**[1:25:13-1:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:13):**  So people can actually come and learn together and then go out and be part of the projects  
**[1:25:19-1:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:19):**  and then at night come and dance and sing and learn and express and eat together in  
**[1:25:24-1:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:24):**  a central village that we create.  
**[1:25:27-1:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:27):**  So it's really taking like the idea of festival culture, bringing it into the city to just  
**[1:25:31-1:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:31):**  blossom in the forms of permanent change so that you can find out more about that at village  
**[1:25:36-1:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:36):**  building, convergence.com or at city repair.org.  
**[1:25:43-1:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:43):**  And you could also go to, um, so you could also go to planet repair.org.  
**[1:25:48-1:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:48):**  There's a little bit there that's where city repair began.  
**[1:25:53-1:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:53):**  Um, and then you can also for our design for design projects from a different organization  
**[1:25:58-1:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:58):**  where we're doing things like villages buy in for people, um, contending with Asperger's  
**[1:26:04-1:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:04):**  or autistic permaculture based autistic village.  
**[1:26:08-1:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:08):**  Um, and lots and lots of prototypes building entire buildings made out of recycled materials,  
**[1:26:15-1:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:15):**  all kinds of natural building projects, all kinds of ecological, social ecological projects,  
**[1:26:20-1:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:20):**  go to communitecture.net and you can see lots of that's larger scale designs.  
**[1:26:26-1:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:26):**  City repair is more like the systemic change involving massive amounts of social culture  
**[1:26:31-1:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:31):**  doing projects that are prototypical.  
**[1:26:34-1:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:34):**  Communitecture's funded projects larger at physical scales, not as much social fusion,  
**[1:26:41-1:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:41):**  but still lots of participatory culture.  
**[1:26:44-1:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:44):**  So those two are sisters.  
**[1:26:46-1:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:46):**  They inhabit the same building where I am right now.  
**[1:26:49-1:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:49):**  Um, and they're part of a network of people that are all working on change.  
**[1:26:54-1:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:54):**  Excellent.  
**[1:26:56-1:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:56):**  And yeah, for those of you who are interested in that, um, village building convergence,  
**[1:27:01-1:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:01):**  so many of the natural builders that I've focused on and then interviewed here on this  
**[1:27:05-1:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:05):**  podcast have done small workshops or, you know, little tutorials during that building  
**[1:27:11-1:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:11):**  convergence.  
**[1:27:13-1:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:13):**  And a lot of you can participate in those.  
**[1:27:15-1:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:15):**  I think, you know, through that website that you mentioned, you can sign up to some of  
**[1:27:19-1:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:19):**  them early on, and it's a great way to get a little crash course in practical projects  
**[1:27:25-1:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:25):**  that can get your hands dirty on a lot of different types of natural building materials  
**[1:27:29-1:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:29):**  as well.  
**[1:27:30-1:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:30):**  Beautiful.  
**[1:27:31-1:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:31):**  Excellent.  
**[1:27:32-1:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:32):**  Mark, again, thank you so much for taking the time.  
**[1:27:34-1:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:34):**  It's always a pleasure to catch up with you.  
**[1:27:36-1:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:36):**  And I've loved the content and the projects that you've been publishing and putting out  
**[1:27:41-1:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:41):**  online for the last couple of years.  
**[1:27:43-1:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:43):**  It's been a big inspiration for me and the general dialogue that you helped to create  
**[1:27:48-1:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:48):**  around compassionate understanding of place and identity that can overcome this violent  
**[1:27:54-1:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:54):**  infrastructure that many of us operate in is a real inspiration to me.  
**[1:27:59-1:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:59):**  So I just wanted to thank you for that and for giving us your time today.

**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:16:11):**  but a lot of farmland across this country is being developed, being extracted from and

**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:16:50):**  There's really not one solution or one structure that is going to solve a transition of 400

**[0:17:07-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:17:07):**  stakeholders who are moving in and are primarily owning for financial returns.

**[0:17:53-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:17:53):**  There are several thousand 5 1 C3 conservation land trusts across the country that primarily

**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:28:04):**  same time it's unique in providing an array of options.

**[0:28:18-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:28:18):**  commons and what partners and what farms to engage with because our goal is really to

**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:28:44):**  on, but it also has to be relevant for those different stakeholders and actors at play.

**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:28:55):**  And the answer to that is that across the, so we incorporated 10 local 501 C2 agrarian

**[0:40:15-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:40:15):**  And it's, you know, there continue to be the impacts on the small and mid-sized farms.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:40:22):**  And again, really to focus on these mid-sized farms because smaller farms, in many cases,  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:40:30):**  it's a hobby farm or a part-time job or there's someone else who has off-farm income.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:40:35):**  And that's not to say off-farm income doesn't exist in mid-sized farms as well, but it's  
**[0:40:41-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:40:41):**  smaller and if their small farm closes, it may not be as big of an impact.

**[0:41:11-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:41:11):**  then the significant aggregation of food system into more and more of the larger big ag and  
**[0:41:21-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:41:21):**  big food businesses that are disconnected from land and or people take over for the

**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:41:38):**  we don't hear about that much.

**[0:42:05-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:42:05):**  of it also is that the food systems narrative, the kind of regenerative agriculture and kind

**[0:42:43-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:42:43):**  farms.

**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:42:50):**  and ecological stewardship?  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:42:51):**  I know you mentioned that a lot of people who are getting into this model are already  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:42:55):**  motivated by those things, but by having land security and a community support structure  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:01):**  that incentivizes these things, how is it starting to promote the way that people are  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:07):**  actually managing the land?  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:08):**  Yeah, well, a couple of ways.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:10):**  So really it's a combination of things and one is touched upon is as we found the agrarian  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:20):**  commons building this culture of aligned values so that the human side and the culture helps  
**[0:43:27-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:27):**  to sustain and build this care of land and regenerative farming practices.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:34):**  So that's critically important and that's built into the structure and why we're working  
**[0:43:39-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:39):**  with the farms we are.

**[0:43:45-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:43:45):**  One is the trust because we're creating these affiliate entities and it's a real balance

**[0:44:04-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:44:04):**  of aligned vision principles goals and really so that the work that the trust does is to  
**[0:44:11-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:44:11):**  ensure through the bylaws, through the lease, through farm and ecological stewardship standards.

**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:44:27):**  and certainly in care and certain agriculture take place.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:44:31):**  So that helps.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:44:34):**  We also are able to, all of us collectively bring about different resources where outside

**[0:45:53-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:45:53):**  farmer on the ground, there's a shared responsibility on stewardship and care of the land and ensuring

**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:46:35):**  from a foundation to support the work, but agrarian trust can.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:46:39):**  So for example, on the ground project now around stewardship is that we agrarian trust

**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:47:10):**  It's working with two agrarian commons.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:47:12):**  One of those agrarian commons also had a local funder who would support that commons to bring

**[0:47:24-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:47:24):**  So each party is investing something to improve the soil and bring about several acres of  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:47:34):**  pollinator habitat across these farms.

**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:48:00):**  in the United States?

**[0:48:09-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:48:09):**  the United States.

**[0:48:33-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bringing-farmland-back-into-the-hands-of-our-communities-with-ian-mcsweeny-of-the-agrarian-trust/#t=0:48:33):**  land.

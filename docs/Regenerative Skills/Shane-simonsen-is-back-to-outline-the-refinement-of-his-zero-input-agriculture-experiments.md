**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:02:29):**  with his limited time as the primary caretaker of his land.

**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:05):**  For plant nerds like Shane and I, I think it's going to be a real treat.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:08):**  So let's jump right in.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:09):**  Alright, well Shane, man, this has been a long time coming.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:12):**  We've been a little bit out of touch, but I have been following your blog and you have  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:16):**  continued to push forward your experiments and your trials on your farm to new heights,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:22):**  but now in a different direction.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:24):**  We were talking before this, you were talking about how after all of this diversity of experimentation,  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:31):**  you have started to feel a little bit of overwhelm and are starting on a bit of a different direction  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:36):**  to consolidate the things that are working and develop them further rather than have  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:42):**  this broad range that you're not really sure how to manage.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:45):**  Do you want to clarify a little bit about some of the difficulties of that way of doing  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:50):**  things before and the direction you're headed in now?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:54):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:03:55):**  So the way I explain it to people is the first five years full-time on the farm was all about  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:00):**  differentiation.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:01):**  So everything I could get my hands on, I put it in the ground, ran it through my system,  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:05):**  and saw how it performed.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:07):**  And through that process, some dependable winners have emerged.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:12):**  And I've got enough of the really high level crops now that I can scale back the amount  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:17):**  of differentiation, trying to pick out the new things that I didn't know I wanted until  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:23):**  I tried them.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:25):**  So that leaves me moving into the integration phase.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:28):**  So I'm just picking out the really good ones and trying to join them together into a more  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:32):**  cohesive whole.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:34):**  So one way of thinking about it is with broad shallow diversity.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:39):**  So that would be like a fruit tree orchard where you've got one of every species.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:43):**  And it's kind of interesting, but you can't really do much breeding work with that.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:46):**  It's kind of like, it's almost like a zoo for plants.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:51):**  And the other extreme would just be to have one species that have all the genetic diversity  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:54):**  that you can possibly put together for a really focused breeding project.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:04:58):**  So I think the sweet spot is somewhere between those extremes of monoculture with really  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:03):**  deep diversity or one of everything.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:05):**  So yeah, that's the stage that I'm in.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:09):**  And so for people who perhaps didn't listen to the original interview, can you give us  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:13):**  a summary about what it is you're trying to achieve overall with the project that you  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:17):**  have and where it is?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:19):**  Kind of give some context.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:20):**  Yes.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:21):**  Yep.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:22):**  So my main focus is writing the name of my blog, Zero Input Agriculture.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:26):**  I'm developing systems that grow food without irrigation, imported fertility or mechanical  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:32):**  management.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:33):**  So basically about as pre-industrial as you can get.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:36):**  So not commercially oriented.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:39):**  I would never expect someone to use one of these systems to turn it all because the market's

**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:44):**  But for people who want to grow food on a small scale for themselves with practically  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:48):**  zero overheads, other than a little bit of time and the right genetics for your location,  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:53):**  that's the person that I'm interested in helping them go on that journey.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:05:57):**  And so let's talk about your context and the challenges that you're working with there  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:02):**  in Australia.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:03):**  Yes.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:04):**  So I'm in subtropical eastern Australia, fairly close to the coast with a little bit of altitude.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:10):**  And our climate, like most of Australia, is quite unpredictable.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:14):**  So at any time of the year, we can have droughts and that can swing around to floods.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:18):**  We just recently had a very cold, wet summer, which was something we get once a decade,  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:24):**  maybe.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:25):**  And it looks like next year is going to be pretty wet as well.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:27):**  But in the past, as I was saying before, we've had over 40 degrees Celsius on the very first  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:33):**  day of spring in the middle of a six month drought.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:35):**  So take your pick, basically.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:38):**  And to find plants that can cope with all of that, not just one extreme or the other,  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:42):**  takes a little bit of trial and error.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:44):**  But I think I've gotten most of that done.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:46):**  All right.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:47):**  So we talked about a lot of the experiments and the plants that you were trialing in the  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:51):**  previous interview.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:52):**  And now you've kind of come into an acceptance of the ones that are worth developing further  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:06:58):**  and the genetics of breeding them and increasing, I assume, their productivity and their adaptability  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:06):**  to your unique context.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:08):**  Yes.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:09):**  Which ones are you focusing on right now?  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:11):**  Well, I recently did an article on my vegetable tier list and it was interesting, the comments,  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:15):**  because a lot of people have said in their very different location that it's exactly  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:19):**  upside down.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:20):**  So you have to find what works for you.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:23):**  But on my A tier, for those of people familiar with this, this is the second highest level.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:30):**  Pingtung eggplant has been wonderful.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:32):**  It's the dominant variety in East Asia.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:35):**  So it produces long, thin fruit, really tender skin.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:37):**  The bushes get about a metre tall and they last for like two or three years.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:41):**  So it's really great because eggplants are really hard to begin.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:45):**  When you direct sow them, the conditions have to be pretty good.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:48):**  But once they get mature, they'll go, they'll sell through anything.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:52):**  They can take anything.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:53):**  And they've pretty much displaced capsicum and chilli because we don't really eat it.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:07:57):**  My family doesn't eat hot food, so I've kind of lost interest in it.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:01):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:02):**  And so with that being the first tier in the vegetable garden, and I assume you're trying  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:07):**  to grow as much of a nutritionally complete diet, you've also focused on staple crops  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:14):**  as well?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:15):**  Yeah, vegetables are important, but staple crops are bigger.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:18):**  And that's one of the reasons I'm reducing the complexity of the vegetable garden, because  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:21):**  I'd rather put in the minimal amount of effort and get as much as we need rather than...  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:27):**  Well, look at it this way.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:29):**  When you prepare a bed and you usually buy the seeds and you plant it and do all the  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:35):**  weeding, you can do all of that for a new crop and then get nothing if it's the wrong  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:39):**  genetics.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:41):**  And a lot of the last five years has been that process of doing all of the work and  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:45):**  getting nothing except the information about which crop you should plant next year.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:50):**  So it's a difficult mindset for most amateur vegetable growers because they just want the  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:58):**  food.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:08:59):**  So it takes a certain kind of lunatic to want to go through all of that suffering, but that's  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:04):**  me.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:05):**  All right, so let's talk about moving forward now.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:09):**  So you've scaled things back partly for your own health and what you're capable of doing.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:15):**  Yes, I was getting close to burnout.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:17):**  I'm a pretty energetic kind of person, but I've gone through cycles in my life before  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:21):**  where I reached the point of either getting close to losing interest in something or wearing  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:26):**  my body out.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:27):**  And I think the mental burnout is far more dangerous, but I mean, I'm probably a bit  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:32):**  more practiced at not wrecking my body.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:34):**  So yeah, that's the bigger danger for me.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:37):**  And it takes a lot of mental motivation to do crop trials, like I said, where you often  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:40):**  end up empty handed.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:42):**  And what was it that really brought you to the limit?  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:44):**  Like is it just the taps that you have to stay on top of or is it all the complexity  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:49):**  that you need to manage in these types of trials?  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:51):**  This is going to make you laugh, but it's actually, it was actually my successes that  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:56):**  were the final straw.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:09:57):**  And we'll talk about it later, but I had a really good maize crop this year because I'm  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:03):**  still figuring out exactly how to do it well.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:05):**  And I had all this maize, my persimmon trees that I grew from seed six years ago covered  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:09):**  in fruit.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:11):**  And I just didn't really want to find the mental energy to figure out how to prepare  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:15):**  the corn.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:16):**  So I processed it, so it didn't all just rot in the field, but it was sitting around in  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:19):**  buckets and like hanging up in braids.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:21):**  And I was just like looking at it thinking, I think I'm just going to eat a bag of rice  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:25):**  tonight, like that I don't have to think about.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:28):**  Whereas with the corn, I finally got to it.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:30):**  I've got good quality wood ash and I'm doing the nixtamalization.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:33):**  Is that the correct pronunciation?  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:36):**  And I love it.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:37):**  Like I'm putting it in my soups and it tastes amazing.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:40):**  And it's not that hard once you figure out how to do it.

**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:47):**  Are you going to take a chance on completely stuffing everything up and ending up empty  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:50):**  handed?  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:51):**  And I think this is actually part of the dynamic that pre-industrial agriculturalists had.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:10:56):**  So imagine you're growing wheat in southern Italy and some person brings corn along for  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:01):**  the first time hundreds of years ago.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:03):**  And you're like, do I take a chance planting something new?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:06):**  If I stuff it up, will my family stuff?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:08):**  So agriculture can be very conservative once it finds something that seems to work.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:14):**  That makes sense.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:15):**  And that's actually kind of the direction you're headed in now.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:17):**  And so for lower inputs, I mean, obviously the goal overall is zero input.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:24):**  What have been the, well, I guess what have been some of the unexpected learnings from

**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:32):**  The really wonderful thing that I've learned recently when I kind of, you know, wasn't

**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:38):**  I did the bare minimum here and there.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:41):**  One thing that worked really well is in my vegetable garden, I never try and eliminate

**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:50):**  grows so fast that the idea of having these like picture perfect, you know, bare mulched,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:55):**  whatever kind of beds, it just doesn't work.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:11:57):**  Like it's so difficult on anything but the tiniest scale.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:00):**  And if you do succeed in doing it, you usually end up wrecking the soil because all of those  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:04):**  root exits just aren't there.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:06):**  You can add all the compost that you like and it's not the same thing as diverse living  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:10):**  plants.

**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:15):**  So weeds that grow into shrubby things that once they get big, they're really hard to  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:18):**  remove.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:20):**  Weeds that tend to flower without you noticing them.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:23):**  The ones that have really obvious flowers are easier to knock the tops off if you don't  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:26):**  want the population increasing.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:28):**  And also the perennial ones that tend to run underground.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:30):**  So it's quite disruptive to try and get them out.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:34):**  And at the other extreme, you've got the weeds that turn up after the crops have germinated  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:38):**  and established.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:39):**  They just cover the ground a little bit at the best time of the year and they evaporate  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:42):**  once conditions get difficult.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:44):**  So there's some weeds like that that I actually actively encourage.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:48):**  So what that means is there's a failure mode built into the system because I know at some  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:52):**  point for whatever reason, I'm not going to be able to do as much work as I should.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:12:57):**  And when I do that, the system goes down a path that I don't mind as much.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:02):**  So yeah, getting in and clearing the weeds out later won't be a big issue because they're  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:06):**  nice species that play nice, that behave themselves.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:10):**  And that actually have some benefits for the soil in the meantime.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:13):**  You're keeping it covered, you're keeping active root life down there, root exudates  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:17):**  and nurturing the population of microbes.

**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:24):**  and cover it all.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:25):**  And it's like, how often are you that organized with your crises and disasters that you'll  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:30):**  do it in advance?  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:31):**  So normally, like you injure yourself or something in the family happens or you just don't feel  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:35):**  like it after doing it for five years full time and you need a break.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:39):**  And this approach works for me.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:42):**  I've sculpted my weed population into something that is basically a self-sowing green manure

**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:49):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:50):**  Yeah, that is ideal.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:52):**  OK, so from the vegetable garden into your more staple crops, I remember you were trialing  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:13:57):**  bunya nuts and there were a couple other tubers that you had.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:02):**  Where are you at with those?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:03):**  And are they contributing significantly to the staple crops of your diet?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:07):**  Well, the bunya nuts are a very long term process, so I might get one generation out

**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:13):**  Well, I'm hoping to get one generation of maturing and hybridizing and then sending

**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:25):**  I've probably planted three quarters of the space that I put aside for them and they're

**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:34):**  And in a couple of years, I'll turn around and they'll be taller than me.

**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:38):**  I put them in and I'm like, oh, I should have looked after them better.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:41):**  Oh, they're not the right species.

**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:45):**  And then I look again, I'm like, oh, they're doing fine.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:48):**  Or they died and I completely forgot about them, which is a nice surprise as well.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:54):**  Either way, the work is reduced.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:14:56):**  Yeah, exactly.

**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:15:14):**  What would that be similar to, maybe not too high altitude in Italy, not hard freezes,

**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:16:36):**  Can you walk me through the process of how you first start with either seeds or some

**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:16:57):**  So you might find that you plant the crop that you think you want to grow and it just

**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:25:49):**  And some places already are living in post-industrial worlds, like they're already cooking on fires  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:25:53):**  now.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:25:54):**  Being able to provide that resource, I think is absolutely critical.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:25:59):**  And yeah, the weed suppression, when you let the canopy grow out in the off season, the  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:04):**  weeds basically just give up.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:05):**  You end up with a virtually weed free bed if you get the spacing of the rows correct.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:12):**  And what spacing has worked for you?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:15):**  So when I adapted the system to my conditions, I looked at what the Inga Society, Inga Foundation  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:22):**  recommended, and that was one of the rows that I did.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:24):**  And I made another row a little bit narrower and another row a little bit wider.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:29):**  And I also did a double wide row because I figured if their recommendation ends up being  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:33):**  perfect, I could later plant down the middle of that double row and I'd have exactly what

**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:26:54):**  There's more labor available.

**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:27:09):**  Can I get away with cutting a corner here?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:27:11):**  And it's tricky.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:27:14):**  It's funny because previously when we had dry seasons, I found the labor quite manageable  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:27:19):**  because the trees didn't regrow that fast.

**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:27:25):**  This year with it being quite cool and wet, they grew so fast that I didn't really find

**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:27:36):**  maize.

**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:28:05):**  with Inga, partially to provide a little bit of cover for the young trees and give them

**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:28:27):**  Keep the competition manageable.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:28:29):**  Yes, and I do find that Ingas, they're really hard on other trees trying to grow under them  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:28:34):**  because again, they've got that really dense canopy that works great when you're trying  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:28:37):**  to kill weeds, but if you're trying to act as a nursery, maybe not the best choice if  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:28:41):**  you can't manage it intensively.

**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:28:48):**  and that selective pruning in order to simulate different stages in the succession of a perennial  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:28:54):**  food model in which certain ones, as they receive that signal from being pruned, put

**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:03):**  catch up.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:04):**  And as you allow layers of light into the different strata of a forest, you're triggering  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:11):**  the growth patterns of different perennial species.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:13):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:14):**  There was one other interesting variation I did with the double-wide rows.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:19):**  So when they're double-wide, the trees don't produce enough of a canopy to get rid of all  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:24):**  of the weeds.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:25):**  So that row was quite weedy when I started preparing it in the dry spring.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:28):**  So I used my hoe to clear away the big cobble peg bushes and other things that were in the  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:32):**  way and I concentrated that biomass on the side.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:36):**  So all of those weed seeds were the deepest under the canopy of the ice cream beans as  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:40):**  they grew.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:41):**  So I had a really hard time getting established.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:44):**  But the rest of the soil that I'd exposed, which I'm not supposed to do, but anyway,  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:48):**  there was too much of a weed seed bank there to direct sow the maize.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:52):**  Like there'd be a lawn of weeds that would grow around them that I'd have to hoe again.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:29:57):**  And I had all of this wood left over from pruning the ice cream beans back.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:01):**  And I'm like, what can I do with that?  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:03):**  And you know, I make biochar.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:04):**  I make windrows, like long, narrow rows of branches, and I light them at one end and  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:08):**  then quench them as the fire goes along.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:11):**  And I thought about that, but it's really overkill.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:13):**  Like the amount of heat that you apply to the surface works beautifully.

**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:21):**  need.

**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:26):**  So I came up with an idea of what I call a fire sled or a fire chariot, you know chariots  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:31):**  of fire.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:33):**  So I got a piece of metal and I folded it into a little low box and put a couple of  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:38):**  chains on it.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:39):**  And I started the fire in the box.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:41):**  So every few minutes I would move it a little bit further along so that it could just heat  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:30:46):**  treat the very top layer of the soil and kill off the weed seeds to give me just a little

**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:31:26):**  Like I was reading podcasts, listening to podcasts and just wandering around and reading  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:31:31):**  novels while I did it.

**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:31:44):**  I'm going to do a windrow down the middle to make biochar.

**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:31:52):**  So small seeds like grain amaranth and chia, they need a really clean seed bed to get started.

**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:32:36):**  about or sure, the labor part is often not calculated in this.

**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:32:50):**  or the body in different ways.

**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:32:56):**  It's like if someone sends you an email and you have to reply immediately versus whenever

**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:16):**  The description pretty much, pretty much.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:19):**  So the descriptions weren't very detailed.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:20):**  So anything that was described as white maize, I just basically lock the drawer.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:25):**  I just got about 20 odd varieties.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:29):**  And the first year I planted two or three seeds of each variety out because they're

**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:39):**  I've had so many times where I bought something, was amazed by it, lost the seed, and then  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:43):**  like, I'll just buy it again.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:45):**  And even if it's listed, sometimes it's not the same strain.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:47):**  It'll have the same name, but it's not the same thing.

**[0:35:55-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:55):**  Anyway, so I planted all the varieties out.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:57):**  I labeled them, kept track of them.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:35:59):**  They grew really nicely.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:00):**  We had a good season that year.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:01):**  And they started to cob up and I'm like, oh, this is beautiful.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:04):**  And right beside where I was growing them, there's this giant gum tree.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:08):**  It's one of the original remnant trees.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:11):**  It's full of knots, so they never cut it down in the timber industry.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:13):**  It's just left.

**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:19):**  and going from all over the continent.

**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:25):**  they destroyed it.

**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:27):**  Except there were a few varieties, I think there were four varieties, that they kind

**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:33):**  And they went to the next variety over.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:36):**  And I kept a record of what those good varieties were that could stand up to the parrots.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:41):**  And the next year I only planted those varieties because corn is really, it's a sex maniac.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:46):**  It loves outcrossing.

**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:52):**  in my mix.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:53):**  So that's the foundation of my population.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:36:57):**  And true to my prediction, within a few years, the government seed bank had been sold off  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:02):**  to commercial seed companies.

**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:04):**  And they probably knew the people running it.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:07):**  They probably, you know, people talk in government and that's probably one of the reasons they  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:10):**  just were like, you can take whatever you want.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:13):**  That was a once in a lifetime opportunity.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:15):**  And now I have a variety that it performs beautifully.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:18):**  And I only save seed off the cobs that don't even get a little nibble at the top.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:22):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:23):**  Wow.

**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:25):**  What a shame to have lost that resource.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:27):**  And you know, plant genetics is something that is constantly going down.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:30):**  So the efforts to preserve them and continue to develop the genetics in different areas  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:36):**  and under different conditions is so important.

**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:44):**  get quinoa genetics.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:46):**  So another one that's hard for us to access in Australia, not for quarantine issues, at  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:50):**  least.

**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:54):**  So quinoa grows everywhere from Peru down to Chile, and it's very sensitive to day length  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:37:59):**  changes.

**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:38:04):**  And in Australia, we only really have access to the varieties that grow way down south.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:38:08):**  So when I try and grow them, no matter when I sow them, they get to like three inches  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:38:12):**  tall, flower themselves to death.

**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:38:19):**  But there are varieties in Peru, which is on exactly the same latitude as us, that I  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:38:23):**  would love to get some material of.

**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:38:35):**  Yes.

**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:38:48):**  Okay.

**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:39:09):**  Whatever I manage to breed here, I'm going to sell very cheaply or distribute freely  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:39:13):**  to anyone who's interested.

**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:40:31):**  Finding all the genetic diversity that you can, throwing it all together and then trying

**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:40:55):**  livestock in small spaces, but be conscious of what you're actually doing.

**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:41:03):**  I mean, just driving it around the countryside is something that is quite extraordinary in  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:41:08):**  a deep historical perspective.

**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:41:30):**  But geese, by comparison, nobody's messed with them.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:41:33):**  Who'd want to?

**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:41:45):**  There are the European geese and the Asian geese, the Chinese geese they're normally  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:41:49):**  called.

**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:41:55):**  So for the same reasons, getting goose diversity in Australia is really difficult, like importing  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:42:00):**  eggs, thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars.

**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:42:05):**  go through.

**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:42:10):**  European geese.

**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:42:13):**  You often see that happen by accident for fanciers who accidentally let the varieties

**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:42:21):**  They don't know what to do with them.

**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:42:29):**  And the endons are already pretty good at that.

**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:45:01):**  Same kind of comparison between geese, which are herbivores and ducks, which are omnivores.

**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:45:37):**  Absolutely.

**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:45:39):**  And then with the goats.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:45:40):**  So now this is something that we have in common because we raised goats when I lived in Guatemala.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:45:43):**  And I'm aware of some of the challenges of such an intelligent animal and just how much  
**[0:45:50-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:45:50):**  damage that they can do if they're not kind of monitored and if they're not in the right  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:45:54):**  environment, but that they also have some pretty high mineral needs.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:45:59):**  And I don't know, like how attentive are you to the knees of the flock or is this also  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:06):**  a trial in which you're trying to reduce the inputs and the maintenance as much as possible?  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:11):**  Absolutely.

**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:16):**  of goats.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:18):**  And I was lucky that we have really good genetics of Saanens in Australia.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:21):**  We have better, they originally came from Switzerland and it's kind of like we sell  
**[0:46:25-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:25):**  camels to the Saudis now.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:27):**  We've got better Saanen goats than anywhere in where they originally come from in Europe.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:32):**  So I was very lucky with that.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:33):**  Originally I'm like, oh, I'm going to play around with mixed different breeds in.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:36):**  And I love the Saanen so much from day one that it's one area that I've decided I can  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:40):**  save that energy and just be happy with it as it is.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:44):**  That said, my very first animals were show stock that were fed on concentrates and kept  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:48):**  in stalls.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:49):**  So I had a very difficult process of slowly weaning them off all of those very expensive  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:53):**  feed inputs.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:46:55):**  The first generation had a hard time, but the second generation that started with virtually  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:01):**  no inputs have done a million times better.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:03):**  A lot of the problems I had in the first flock, I just haven't seen them again.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:07):**  So that's one thing.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:08):**  And I've since brought in another buck from one of the last production lines of Saanen  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:13):**  goats in Australia, like a commercial dairy that's nearby.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:17):**  And in terms of managing parasites and minerals, the main thing is to have lots of weeds and  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:22):**  lots of trees that you can cut for them.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:24):**  And with the cows, when I had before, I was doing very intensive rotation, like weekly  
**[0:47:29-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:29):**  moves with electric fences going everywhere.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:32):**  That worked because the cows tend to keep the pasture quite low and running the lines  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:36):**  out without them shorting on the wet grass is relatively easy.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:39):**  That doesn't work for the goats.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:41):**  I couldn't manage that amount of fencing with pastures that are often over my head.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:48):**  So instead I've got larger paddocks and I do a slower rotation.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:52):**  But the advantage is the goats are really good at finding what they need.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:55):**  They don't just sit in one corner like the cows lazy, though the Saanens are a little  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:47:58):**  bit lazy.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:00):**  The advantage of them being really lazy is I've managed to control them with a single  
**[0:48:04-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:04):**  electric line.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:06):**  Just one bit of electric tape is all it takes at the right height.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:09):**  And I can leave it off for, I think the record is three months and they didn't go near it.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:14):**  So the Saanens are a particularly gentle and not very naughty breed.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:19):**  So I think if I had brought in other genetics, I'd be fighting with them escaping more often.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:22):**  Oh, that is fortunate.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:25):**  And having paddocks that are so big that they never really run out of something to find  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:29):**  is the other big thing.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:30):**  And they do still get a mineral lick supplement, but I'm hoping in time as more trees end up  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:35):**  in those places for them and I have more fodder to cut for them, I could scale that back.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:41):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:43):**  Especially, yeah, it's taking away the motivation for them to try and escape.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:47):**  If they're happy where they are and they don't really need anything that they can see around  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:50):**  them, they tend not to push the boundaries as much.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:53):**  That's really key.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:48:55):**  I think a big part of my success too is I've planted living hedges on the outside of the  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:01):**  single lines, the single electric lines.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:05):**  So if you've just got a single electric line, a goat can jump over it or go under it really  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:08):**  quickly if they learn how to do that and then they're on the other side.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:12):**  And if you only have a hedge, they'll gradually eat their way through it if you don't do the  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:15):**  rotation perfectly or if you're not out there with a stick kind of watching them.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:19):**  If you put the two together though, they synergize beautifully because the hedge slows them down  
**[0:49:24-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:24):**  enough that they touch the line and the line stops them from sticking their head into the

**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:33):**  I love it when those things kind of combine and work together.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:37):**  I haven't heard a lot of those trials yet.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:40):**  Okay, so let's switch gears now and focus on this concept for the new book that you  
**[0:49:46-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:46):**  have.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:47):**  So just in the early stages, I remember you telling me, but the concept is something that  
**[0:49:51-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:51):**  I'm really drawn to.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:52):**  Can you give us an overview of what you're working on?  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:49:55):**  Okay, so first thing probably is to outline the genre, which I think is hard to classify.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:00):**  So yeah, this isn't a Mills and Boone bestseller, but I would like to reach some people.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:05):**  I've been enjoying writing it, so hopefully they enjoy reading it.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:08):**  So it is, I guess the closest thing I could say is speculative science fiction, but it's  
**[0:50:13-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:13):**  based on hard biology.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:15):**  So it's a hard sci-fi book based more on biology than the usual rockets and robots and jetting  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:21):**  off into the universe to argue with people with different shaped ears.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:26):**  And it's set in about 5,000 years from now, which is enough time for a bit of biology  
**[0:50:31-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:31):**  to have happened.

**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:39):**  that happened in the Middle East and explain to a hunter-gatherer that those weedy grasses  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:43):**  that occasionally get a little bit of a feed out of, within a few thousand years, there's  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:48):**  going to be something called Babylon and there's going to be this many people all piled on  
**[0:50:51-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:51):**  top of each other.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:52):**  They're going to be writing, they're going to be doing all these crazy things.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:55):**  And it would seem like science fiction to them.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:57):**  Like it would seem so fantastical.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:50:59):**  And my interest is exploring could that kind of thing happen again, based on the knowledge  
**[0:51:06-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:06):**  of biology that we have today.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:08):**  Okay, so outline what this concept looks like from the perspective of the people living  
**[0:51:15-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:15):**  it.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:16):**  They don't have a memory of the collapse of this civilization, but I would imagine in  
**[0:51:20-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:20):**  5,000 years, there are still a ton of remnants of our trash and our civilization, if nothing  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:27):**  else.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:28):**  Actually, if you, and I did research this, if you look into it by 5,000 years, there'll  
**[0:51:31-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:31):**  be almost nothing left.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:33):**  Really?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:34):**  And from the people who are left, we're almost just kind of legendary.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:39):**  Like there's stories that are shared because they sound interesting, but no one completely  
**[0:51:42-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:42):**  believes them.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:43):**  Okay, so at this point, the society as we know it now is basically part of the mythology  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:48):**  of this new culture.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:51):**  And they talk about it, but they don't have any real reference to it and they don't know  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:54):**  how it works.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:51:55):**  Yes, but some groups of people have maintained little pockets of some technology that is  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:00):**  feasible that it could be managed on a lower scale of complexity.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:04):**  So basically start the story with those people.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:07):**  So it looks a little bit more like just a dystopian kind of world to begin, but then  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:13):**  over time you get to understand that other parts of the world have traveled in a very  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:17):**  different direction to almost be unrecognizable.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:21):**  Okay, so basically the modern society that we know now has collapsed and different parts  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:29):**  of the world due to their increased isolation from the lack of the communications technology  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:33):**  that we enjoy now have evolved quite separately.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:38):**  And what are some of the range of developments that you're entertaining in this story?  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:43):**  Oh, interesting detailed question.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:45):**  So the majority of the story is focused on a small group of people who've managed to  
**[0:52:50-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:50):**  maintain simple battery technology, simple light bulbs, and really simple electricity.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:52:58):**  Though that is supported by a somewhat artificial structure that makes that possible.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:07):**  Other parts of the world have gone way back to being medieval and have lost all of that.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:11):**  And so is this looked at from a perspective of, oh, what a shame for all that they've  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:16):**  lost or a curiosity for all the things that have developed almost in parallel without  
**[0:53:22-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:22):**  having access to artificially cheap energy as we know it now?  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:28):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:30):**  It's a hopeful, open-ended, curious kind of exploration.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:35):**  So that's why it doesn't really fit into post-apocalyptic either.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:38):**  Those novels are normally completely focused on suffering and deprivation and loss.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:43):**  And yeah, that trope has been done so successfully that I didn't want to write it again.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:47):**  And same with the idea of flying off to the stars.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:51):**  John Michael Greer talks about this in particular, that our culture has this false dichotomy  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:53:55):**  of either we're going to have this Star Trek future or we're going back to the cave  
**[0:54:00-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:00):**  and there's nothing in between.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:01):**  And I think he's right in saying that both of those are cop-outs and that there's  
**[0:54:06-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:06):**  interesting and difficult work for us to do every single day between now and whatever  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:09):**  future you want to imagine that will lead us in all sorts of unexpected directions.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:14):**  And getting back to what I'm doing now, the only resources that we have that are truly  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:21):**  renewable are biological resources, because you can reproduce them indefinitely and change  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:26):**  them almost indefinitely, and human skills and knowledge, our culture.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:30):**  They're like a kind of parallel genomic system for human societies.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:35):**  Yeah, I would agree.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:36):**  And that's one of the reasons why I really wanted to explore this with you is because  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:39):**  I've often thought about what the possible scenarios after collapse are.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:45):**  And I've done some reading about this.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:46):**  And the reassuring thing for me is that societies have collapsed many times in the past and  
**[0:54:52-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:52):**  are currently in different stages of collapse around the world.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:56):**  And we don't have to necessarily guess about what would happen.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:54:59):**  We have a lot of references to draw from and examples of where in these different stages  
**[0:55:07-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:55:07):**  of collapse it can either be arrested or be accelerated.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:55:11):**  And there's a great book by Dmitry Orlov called The Five Stages of Collapse, which  
**[0:55:15-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:55:15):**  I'm specifically referencing here.

**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:55:29):**  they have also recovered for various different reasons.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:55:33):**  And collapse doesn't necessarily mean the end.

**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:55:42):**  with different resources in different parts of the world, I would imagine was part of

**[0:55:51-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:55:51):**  Absolutely.

**[0:55:55-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:55:55):**  So at the moment in today, the globe has a 2% per annum birth rate and a 1% death rate.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:03):**  And that's a really easy thought experiment.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:05):**  So imagine you know 100 people.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:07):**  That means every year on average, you see two babies being born and you go to one funeral.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:12):**  And it's like, you know, that's life.

**[0:56:27-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:27):**  So let's turn around the equation.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:29):**  Let's say now in our group of 100 friends, there is one baby born and two people die.

**[0:56:52-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:52):**  one with 8 billion people on it.

**[0:56:58-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:58):**  Yeah, that's true.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:56:59):**  And 70 years is not an unimaginable amount of time, even for people who are not particularly

**[0:57:09-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:09):**  of the USSR.

**[0:57:16-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:16):**  But for the average person living year to year, they didn't really notice that things  
**[0:57:19-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:19):**  have changed that much in terms of births and deaths.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:23):**  There was probably more changes at the cultural level and economic.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:28):**  It's usually the political and economic system that cracks up first.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:32):**  And if things get really bad, then the cultural system gets forced to change.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:35):**  That's one of those later stages of collapse, like we mentioned.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:38):**  And the beautiful thing about having what is effectively a synthetic economy like this  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:44):**  financial layer on top is that you can change it almost arbitrarily.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:49):**  So for instance, a lot of people worry about the debt and hyperinflation, all that kind  
**[0:57:54-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:54):**  of stuff.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:57:55):**  But if you look at past examples of hyperinflation, it's when one isolated, weakly coupled currency  
**[0:58:01-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:01):**  debased itself and the stronger currencies took advantage of that situation.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:06):**  We're all inflating at the same rate.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:08):**  So there is no there's no gradient.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:11):**  There's no financial gradient between different places that makes money go rushing from one  
**[0:58:15-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:15):**  side of the planet to the other and causing all sorts of chaos.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:18):**  We're kind of like the Tom Lehrer song, we're all going together when we go.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:22):**  Oh, that's a really interesting way to look at it.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:25):**  So even though it is localized and where it's being felt, it is spread out globally in the  
**[0:58:31-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:31):**  longer term.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:32):**  So that's an upside to having a still functioning global economy.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:37):**  It kind of smooths things out to some degree.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:41):**  And OK, so in the perspective of writing this.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:44):**  Yes.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:45):**  Like, how are you telling the story from?  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:47):**  Is it from a first person perspective of someone going through it or is it from a narrative  
**[0:58:52-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:52):**  like this is what is happening during this time?  
**[0:58:54-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:54):**  Yeah, it's predominantly a first person perspective because I've got a background in technical  
**[0:58:58-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:58:58):**  writing, so I have to make a real effort to make the characters and the relationships  
**[0:59:04-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:59:04):**  really interesting and not just make it about world building and science.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:59:06):**  So I think I've done that well.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:59:08):**  I almost worry that I've made it a little bit too dramatic.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:59:11):**  But you know, people love drama.

**[0:59:19-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:59:19):**  So that's the challenge of writing and I'm loving it.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=0:59:21):**  I'm really enjoying the process.

**[1:07:15-1:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=1:07:15):**  I'd maybe bring up a real world example.

**[1:07:56-1:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=1:07:56):**  right?

**[1:09:32-1:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/shane-simonsen-is-back-to-outline-the-refinement-of-his-zero-input-agriculture-experiments/#t=1:09:32):**  really well with your plant breeding trials and the general experiment that is your property

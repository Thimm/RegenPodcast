**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerating-nature-in-the-arctic-circle-and-the-shortcomings-of-permaculture-with-moli-the-permaculture-viking-122/#t=0:04:42):**  and then that led into other things and I became disabled and then I went for agriculture.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerating-nature-in-the-arctic-circle-and-the-shortcomings-of-permaculture-with-moli-the-permaculture-viking-122/#t=0:04:50):**  And this was all in Iceland?

**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerating-nature-in-the-arctic-circle-and-the-shortcomings-of-permaculture-with-moli-the-permaculture-viking-122/#t=0:09:32):**  a PDC course, a permaculture design course.

**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerating-nature-in-the-arctic-circle-and-the-shortcomings-of-permaculture-with-moli-the-permaculture-viking-122/#t=0:09:44):**  agreed that we needed a permaculture association.

**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerating-nature-in-the-arctic-circle-and-the-shortcomings-of-permaculture-with-moli-the-permaculture-viking-122/#t=0:13:54):**  else in the area.

**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerating-nature-in-the-arctic-circle-and-the-shortcomings-of-permaculture-with-moli-the-permaculture-viking-122/#t=0:14:22):**  And we've probably learned way more from our failures because we didn't realize how incredibly

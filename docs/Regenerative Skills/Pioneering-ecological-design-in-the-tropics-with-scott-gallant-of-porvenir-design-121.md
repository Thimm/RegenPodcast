### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:05):**  of natural building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:09):**  As always, I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great interview for you today,  
**[0:00:13-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:13):**  so let's jump right on in.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:24):**  My guest today is Scott Gallant, who is a resident farm manager at Rancho Masatal, which  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:30):**  is a permaculture and natural building design and teaching site in Costa Rica.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:35):**  Now Scott grew up in a little town in Ohio, just outside of Cincinnati, spending most  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:40):**  of his childhood playing in the neighborhood farmland.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:43):**  He later went to a small liberal arts school in Indiana called Wabash College, where he  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:48):**  studied economics and rhetoric.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:50):**  After that, he was on track to get a job in finances, but instead took a detour when he  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:00:55):**  decided to take some time off and head out west to work for a conservation crew.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:01):**  There he met his partner Laura, and she convinced him to hitchhike through Mexico with her to  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:05):**  learn Spanish.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:07):**  Long story short, he says, we ended up at Rancho Masatal in Costa Rica, where he soon  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:12):**  began running the farm, teaching permaculture, and eventually doing consulting work.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:18):**  Since then, Scott has been featured on Permaculture Voices with Diego Footer, on a recent USDA  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:24):**  Inside Agroforestry Beginning Farmers newsletter, and has written many articles for the Permaculture  
**[0:01:30-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:30):**  Research Institute.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:32):**  Now in this episode, Scott talks in detail about his role managing the farm on one of  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:37):**  the premier regenerative living sites in the world, and the journey that got him to that  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:41):**  point.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:42):**  He also gives advice to beginners who might be looking to get involved in land management  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:46):**  and regenerative projects themselves.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:49):**  Stay tuned at the end of this podcast, where I'll offer a last chance opportunity to claim  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:53):**  the last spot in our June Intro to Natural Building course that will teach you everything  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:01:58):**  you need to know to get started building for yourself with natural materials.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:02):**  Now I'll turn things over to Scott.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:04):**  Hey Scott, thanks so much for taking the time.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:08):**  Yeah, my pleasure.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:09):**  Glad to be here.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:11):**  So you say you're currently in Costa Rica, but not on the ranch.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:18):**  That's correct.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:19):**  I am in the northern part of the country in Monteverde, which is famous for the cloud  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:23):**  forests and a big national park and private reserve area.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:26):**  Oh nice, I've seen pictures of that place.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:28):**  It must be gorgeous there.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:31):**  It's pretty stunning, yeah.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:32):**  It's very wet too.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:33):**  Yes, well it is here too where I am in Guatemala as the rainy season starts.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:38):**  But hey, let's jump right into the first question.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:39):**  I've got a lot of stuff I want to cover with you.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:42):**  Excellent.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:43):**  Alright, so now Scott, I know you had a fairly typical North American upbringing and education.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:48):**  You even said you were all set to go into a career in finance after university, but  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:52):**  instead you took a detour.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:02:55):**  Tell me the story behind why you decided to make that change and how that resulted in  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:00):**  getting to where you are now.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:02):**  Yeah, so I was studying economics at a small school in the Midwest and really didn't know  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:13):**  any other alternatives.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:15):**  That was pretty much what you did.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:17):**  You went to college and then you'd go get a job.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:19):**  I had never heard of someone doing the Peace Corps or going and backpacking around Central  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:26):**  America.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:27):**  Those were very foreign things.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:29):**  I literally didn't know a single person from my high school who did something alternative  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:34):**  like that.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:36):**  Throughout college I just kind of knew I was looking for something a little bit different,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:39):**  but just didn't have a role model or a mentor to see what that might be.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:47):**  Got lucky enough to find just kind of an odd job on the internet of going and doing trail  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:51):**  crew out in Colorado.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:53):**  I was interested in going out West and kind of escaping the Midwest.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:03:58):**  I got a really good job offer as a project manager for a company in Madison, Wisconsin  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:05):**  right out of school.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:06):**  I put it on hold to go do Conservation Corps in Durango.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:10):**  No kidding, which Conservation Corps was it?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:14):**  Southwest Conservation Corps.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:16):**  Yeah, I worked with them for three seasons.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:18):**  No, actually four.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:19):**  Excellent.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:20):**  I definitely know a lot of the similar people.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:23):**  It's funny how many people of similar mindsets and ambitions kind of run through those same  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:29):**  different jobs and circles.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:30):**  That's really cool.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:32):**  That became a reintroduction of nature for myself.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:37):**  I was a really nature-oriented kid, but kind of lost that in middle school and high school  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:41):**  just playing sports and doing all the typical things that you do in high school.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:48):**  Going out West and just like camping in the backcountry, really became convinced that  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:04:54):**  I was not going to be happy taking a corporate job, sitting at a desk.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:00):**  I was very fortunate, am very fortunate.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:02):**  I'm a white dude from the United States of America.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:05):**  I didn't have any college debt.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:07):**  My parents are supportive.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:10):**  I just realized that I could do anything I wanted.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:13):**  I ended up reading a book called Last Child in the Woods by Richard Louv.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:21):**  He kind of founded this idea of a nature deficit disorder as a psychological syndrome.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:27):**  I remember reading that and it really struck home that I was forming and kind of brought  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:33):**  me on this path of education a little bit, rescaling and connecting with nature on a  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:39):**  deeper level.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:41):**  At the end of that three-month period, to make a long story short, basically had a bunch  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:46):**  of different options, one of which was taking a corporate job.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:50):**  Another was continuing with the Conservation Corps.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:53):**  The third option, I had met my current partner, Laura.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:05:56):**  She was and is very adventurous.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:00):**  She asked me to come hitchhiking through Mexico with her to learn Spanish.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:04):**  I decided to do that.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:06):**  That really triggered it all and haven't looked back since.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:10):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:11):**  Now, I know many people including myself who've taken permaculture design courses and have  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:16):**  had it transform their lives and how they interact with their environments.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:20):**  How did you go from taking the course of permaculture by the time you made it down, I assume you  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:26):**  took this in Masatal?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:28):**  I did, yeah.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:29):**  How did you go from that course all the way to managing a whole farm in the tropics?  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:34):**  Yeah, so I kind of took it from a different way.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:38):**  I basically started managing the farm first and didn't really think about it from a permaculture  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:44):**  perspective.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:45):**  I was more tuned in with agroforestry community.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:49):**  That was the language that I was using, the resources that I was studying.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:06:54):**  And then our main permaculture instructor, Chris Shanks, who runs a project called Project  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:00):**  Bonafide in Nicaragua, he approached me about starting to co-teach with him, taking over  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:05):**  the course, and I decided that I should probably take the class if I was going to do that.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:10):**  So I took the class really just, shoot, maybe four years ago now.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:17):**  And so I already had about three years of managing the farm at the ranch with other  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:20):**  people, of course, before kind of adopting the language of permaculture.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:26):**  And some of the tools, which for me really became design as a tool that I hadn't thought  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:32):**  about prior, that became the main addition to my tool belt after that class.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:39):**  Nice.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:40):**  Now, for those of us who haven't visited Mastatals already, can you describe the farm and some  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:46):**  of the most important enterprises and productions and how it's continuing to grow and mature?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:52):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:54):**  So Rancho Mastatals is located in a really tiny town of about a hundred, a hundred and  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:07:59):**  twenty people in rural Costa Rica.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:01):**  It was founded in 2001 by Robin Nunes and Tim O'Hara, a couple from upstate New York.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:08):**  And it is an education center first and foremost.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:13):**  So we're organized basically as an LLC, we're just a small business, which is unusual for  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:19):**  an education center.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:22):**  Usually those enterprises run more in the nonprofit sector.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:27):**  But we generate all of our own income and livelihoods through the classes that we offer,  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:32):**  through hosting groups, whether that's like university or college groups, high school  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:37):**  groups coming down to study everything from tropical ecology to permaculture, natural  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:43):**  building, et cetera.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:45):**  And that's kind of the bread and butter of what we do.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:49):**  We have an apprenticeship program that lasts for a year.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:52):**  It's a highly competitive program.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:08:54):**  We receive guests and everything that we do there with all the people coming through and  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:00):**  there's quite a bit is based around kind of growing our campus.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:07):**  And so almost everyone that comes through is going to participate in some aspect, whether  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:11):**  that's processing food for a kitchen, going out to the farm and planting or coppicing  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:18):**  trees or harvesting or working on a new wall system for the new bunkhouse, which has been  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:23):**  the case this year.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:24):**  We've done a lot of hands building the wattle and daub walls.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:27):**  And so it's very didactic.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:31):**  It's really designed for people to get involved and kind of get just a taste for short term  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:35):**  people or for the apprentices, like really build hard skills in all these different domains  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:41):**  that kind of float around the concept of permaculture design.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:46):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:48):**  And so it sounds like you do quite a few experimental things with the grounds there and what you  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:53):**  sort of practice and try out within the realm of permaculture.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:56):**  Can you give me some examples of those experiments?  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:09:59):**  Yeah, it's a great question.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:01):**  So in my realm, which is really managing the agroforestry systems, one of our goals there  
**[0:10:09-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:09):**  is to be a place in our region that can trial new crops and practice trial new techniques  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:19):**  because most of our neighbors don't have that luxury.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:21):**  They don't have the ability to devote new land to some obscure nut tree or the time  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:27):**  to dig swales, for example.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:31):**  And so we're interested in seeing how those techniques work, how those different crops  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:35):**  work.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:36):**  We expect we're going to fail a lot.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:38):**  I expect that many of the trees I plant will end up being either mediocre for our climate  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:42):**  or being very difficult to process for our kitchen.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:46):**  So everything we do comes a little bit from that perspective.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:50):**  You want to be the risk takers basically.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:53):**  And so a good example is we're trialing a lot of different underutilized nut trees.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:10:59):**  So we have things like peeling nut, Tahitian chestnut, okari nut, malabar chestnut is a  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:05):**  fairly extensive list.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:08):**  And these are nuts that from their places of origin are staple crops.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:13):**  You can go to the market in the Philippines and there's baskets of peeling nut.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:18):**  It's delicious nuts similar to macadamia.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:22):**  But here in Costa Rica, it is unknown.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:25):**  Most of the tropics, it's unknown.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:27):**  And so we're interested in finding out is that something that grows well where we are?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:32):**  Are we able to process it from a culinary perspective?  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:35):**  Can it fit into existing food cultures?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:39):**  And if so, if those three things are met, then we think we can potentially replace maybe  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:47):**  a more destructive agricultural practice such as the annual monocropping of beans for example.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:54):**  We just look at a protein to protein replacement.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:11:57):**  Can we replace that with something like peeling nut?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:01):**  That's like a tough question to answer.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:03):**  I really view that as like a multigenerational problem that has like a lot of cultural implications.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:10):**  But I think what we're doing is with many other people in the region and in Costa Rica  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:14):**  and of course around the world are starting those experiments, starting those trials to  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:19):**  see what a new agriculture will look like really.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:26):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:27):**  Have you ever worried about some of the plants or the species that you're importing into  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:33):**  your area becoming invasive?  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:36):**  And if so, how do you make sure that that's a risk that's minimized?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:40):**  Yeah, it's a good question.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:42):**  It's not something that I spend a lot of time worrying about mostly because we're not importing  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:48):**  any plants.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:50):**  So this peeling nuts for example, I'm getting seeds from botanical gardens in the country  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:56):**  already.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:12:58):**  Most domesticated plants have had the kind of the wildness bred out of them.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:08):**  There's definitely exceptions to that and we have plants on our property that have high  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:15):**  invasive potential.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:18):**  Usually they're ornamentals in the tropics is my experience.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:24):**  For me it just comes down to due diligence.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:26):**  You should do your research.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:27):**  It should be pretty easy to figure out if you plant something, can it spread real easily?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:34):**  A lot of that information is out there but it's not for us pretty much everything we're  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:40):**  working with.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:42):**  There's some other people working with it in Costa Rica and so I don't stress out about  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:46):**  it too much.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:47):**  Well, those are some good precautions to take.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:50):**  Now in all these experiments that you've seen the results of over successive years, are  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:55):**  there any that you're really excited about or have already sort of taken hold either  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:13:59):**  in the surrounding communities or show a lot of potential for larger either scaling or  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:05):**  implementation?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:07):**  Yeah, I think that more than anything is just a shift toward a perennial based agriculture.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:17):**  And so where we are, there's probably now in our small town there's three other kind  
**[0:14:24-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:24):**  of ecotourism projects that are all starting to work with trees and looking at different  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:34):**  species that no one would have considered before.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:37):**  Things like jackfruit have a real potential to like shape the food systems in our area.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:44):**  And so some species are coming out.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:48):**  There's an increasing look at turmeric in particular as an economic crop.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:14:56):**  And I can think of two or three farms in our area that are starting to grow turmeric to  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:03):**  either export out of Costa Rica to different markets or they're processing it as a medicinal  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:09):**  product and selling it in country.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:11):**  So some species are trickling in there.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:15):**  Different techniques are there's a grass that we work with that's really common in the tropics  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:19):**  called vetiver grass.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:21):**  Anyone from that climate will likely be familiar with it.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:25):**  There's many thousands of plants in most of the tall but they all really started with  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:28):**  literally one plug that Tim and Robin brought in years ago on a trip to a different farm  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:35):**  on the other side of the country perhaps.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:39):**  And that one plug is spread to a number of farms in the area and people really recognize  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:45):**  the benefits of that plant and the erosion control functions that it has.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:50):**  And so there's a lot of little things like that.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:53):**  But like I said it really feels like a slow process.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:15:56):**  I think that's OK with the cultural barriers and the reality of working with some of these  
**[0:16:02-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:02):**  species that I'm very hesitant to recommend something until I feel really confident that  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:11):**  it's going to produce well and that it fits.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:13):**  And with some of these trees like nut trees I mean that's you know maybe that's a 15 year  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:17):**  timeline before I can say that with confidence.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:20):**  And so that's a perspective that I try to keep constantly.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:23):**  Yeah it's really important.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:25):**  I'm glad that there are people like you out there taking those precautions and doing the  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:29):**  research so that we can help to advance you know the knowledge of different climatic conditions  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:35):**  and all these different experiments that you mentioned all the faster.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:41):**  Now I know where you're at in Rancho Mas atal being located in Costa Rica.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:45):**  Your farm is deep in the tropical rainforest.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:48):**  Can you tell me about some of the many benefits and challenges that you face in that climate  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:52):**  and some of the ways that you've developed to work with them?  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:57):**  So we're in a cool environment.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:16:59):**  We're in a transition zone between the dry tropical forests of northern Costa Rica kind  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:04):**  of the Guanacaste area and then the wet like true monsoon rainforests of southern Costa  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:09):**  Rica.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:11):**  And then we're also in a transition zone from the coast into the interior highlands.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:18):**  And so the national park that borders our property is actually has the greatest diversity  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:23):**  of trees in the country which becomes this great advantage for us in that we can draw  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:30):**  from a lot of different climates in the type of tree crops that we work with.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:34):**  So that becomes a really beautiful advantage for us and a fun thing to play with.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:40):**  We have this huge diversity of species and if we start looking at climate ecological  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:45):**  analogs from around the globe there's a lot to play with.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:47):**  There's a lot to trial.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:50):**  And you quickly find out that there's things that they grow in Papua New Guinea that people  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:17:56):**  there eat and they're a great part of the diet and their plants that fit well with that  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:01):**  climate that fit well with our climate as well.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:05):**  And so that's one of the big advantages of working in the humid tropics.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:11):**  The challenges where we're at are you know there's the obvious challenges of like a huge  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:19):**  amount of rain.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:20):**  We get probably around four meters of rain a year maybe a little bit more.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:27):**  Tropical soils are typically pretty poor in quality.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:31):**  Those are kind of obvious challenges but where we are the biggest challenge is access.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:36):**  We're a two hour bus ride from the nearest town.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:39):**  There's one bus in and out.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:41):**  So just getting people in for workshops can be a challenge.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:45):**  If our goal was to produce for market which is what people historically did in the region  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:53):**  it can be a real chore.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:18:54):**  That road can be out in the rainy season for a week at a time or more with the heavy rains  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:00):**  and the landslides that can occur.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:03):**  And so that is like a physical access limitation and then it also becomes psychological.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:11):**  Just being really isolated in a rural community has great benefits and it's something that  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:15):**  I wouldn't trade for a busy city any day but it becomes challenging to share information,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:21):**  share plants and that communication can feel like it can slow down your progress when you  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:30):**  know there's other people out there that you'd be able to leverage their experience a bit  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:34):**  more if you have the ability to connect a little easier.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:37):**  So that to me is a challenge that I see on sites all around the tropics and probably  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:42):**  everywhere in rural communities but feels very pronounced where we are.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:48):**  Sure no doubt.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:49):**  Where I'm at in Guatemala we have quite a few of those as well.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:51):**  Fortunately we're not quite as isolated.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:53):**  I can get to a larger town in about an hour but it's a boat ride because there's no road  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:19:59):**  that connects us to it.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:01):**  Yeah it's a different type of isolation.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:04):**  It is yeah.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:05):**  Fortunately because of the tourist industry around here, their boats run fairly regularly  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:09):**  and it's not nearly as cut off but I definitely know some of the things you're talking about  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:13):**  including the climate because though we're up higher in the mountains right now, we get  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:18):**  the rains like you're talking about and our soil also is often pretty poor not just inherently  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:26):**  but because it's been degraded by poor farming practices for quite a few generations and  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:32):**  seems we're in the mountains anyway it's extremely rocky and in order to clear a place for planting  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:39):**  or for cultivation it takes a lot of man hours and most of these sites are inaccessible by  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:46):**  machinery either with the grades or the fact that there are just no roads to a lot of places  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:51):**  so yeah I definitely know the challenges you're talking about.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:55):**  We don't have any rocks so that part is at least good where we are.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:20:59):**  It's very easy to dig.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:01):**  That's good for the land but I tell you what it's a huge resource for me doing natural  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:05):**  building around here.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:06):**  The rocks are fantastic.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:07):**  Yeah it is great for foundations.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:08):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:09):**  You can cut so much of our cement cost down by just using the rocks that are a constant  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:14):**  pain to dig out of the soil.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:15):**  We just get to reuse them right away on site.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:19):**  Now Scott I know that many of my listeners are passionate about permaculture and regenerative  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:23):**  agriculture but that many of them also don't have their own land and that are always looking  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:28):**  to get involved in projects like yours and really live the permaculture lifestyle.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:33):**  What advice would you give to those people?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:35):**  How would you recommend that they start to get more involved?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:41):**  Yeah I mean I would start close to home and I would see what people are doing there.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:47):**  It seems like everywhere in the world now there's some sort of permaculture activity.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:53):**  So starting there is you know what's local permaculture guild or there are farmers that  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:21:59):**  are practicing and you might find that you have to get away from the language of permaculture  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:05):**  you might you know hop into an organic farm or people practicing ag forestry or agroecology  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:12):**  that might be a little bit turned off by the language of permaculture that also might be  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:16):**  a good way in.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:19):**  And then looking at more of the volunteer internship apprentice opportunities which  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:24):**  I think there's a lot out there.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:27):**  I'd encourage people to once again do your due diligence.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:31):**  I think there's a lot of really good programs and then there's probably some that are mediocre,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:39):**  some that are very young, some that are there's a lot of experience with the instructors and  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:44):**  trying to find a program that fits well with you.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:48):**  You know our program is awesome.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:51):**  I think it's one of the best out there.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:22:54):**  But if you're looking to learn Spanish while practicing permaculture we're not the place  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:00):**  for that.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:01):**  We speak a lot of English for better or worse.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:04):**  If you're looking for a place that also does a lot of healing work and is more spiritual  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:12):**  that's great.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:13):**  There's a lot of places that do that.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:14):**  We don't do that.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:15):**  It's just not part of our culture there.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:19):**  And so finding a spot that fits your style, your personality really well I think is one  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:27):**  of the most important things.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:29):**  On a practical level I would ask if you can speak with past volunteer interns about their  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:38):**  experience.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:39):**  Someone's willing to give you some of that contact information.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:42):**  That's usually a really good sign that they either want you to be a good fit or they yeah  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:52):**  that they're looking out for both parties best interest which is really important.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:57):**  I like that.  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:58):**  That's really good advice.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:23:59):**  If you're looking for people who have experience either in the place that you're looking specifically  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:03):**  or in doing something that you might be interested in reach out to those people.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:07):**  They have fantastic advice.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:08):**  They have great stories from their experiences and it tends to be somewhat of an untapped  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:12):**  resource.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:15):**  And honestly once you start like plugging away in a community I guess this is the other  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:20):**  piece of advice.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:22):**  There's the whole travel around and volunteer on Wolf Farm side of this.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:28):**  But my experience is if you can settle in a place and find a place that fits you whether  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:35):**  you're going to be there for the rest of your life or not once you start building roots  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:40):**  in a place all the opportunities in the world just keep popping up.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:44):**  Once you show that you have a work ethic and people start knowing who you are personally  
**[0:24:49-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:49):**  and they realize they enjoy working with you like that little bit spreads and the opportunities  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:24:58):**  come out of the woodwork.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:01):**  So taking the time to kind of delve into a place settle put down roots even for a whole  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:07):**  year which isn't that long of a period of time but you'll find just after a couple months  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:13):**  that those opportunities really come out.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:16):**  So that's the other piece of advice like don't be afraid to settle for a bit in one place  
**[0:25:21-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:21):**  and again whether it's the place you're going to live the rest of your life or not put the  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:28):**  roots down and take advantage of the opportunities that come with that commitment.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:32):**  I really agree with that.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:34):**  So I've been traveling for almost 11 years not including the time that I've been spending  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:39):**  here in Guatemala and definitely in the beginning I bounced around a ton and there was an advantage  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:45):**  to that I got to see a lot of things but I got to see a lot of things superficially and  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:49):**  once I sort of changed my mindset and my goals of what I wanted to do I would stay in another  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:25:53):**  spot for a couple of months at a time usually at a minimum and especially if you're pursuing  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:00):**  something like permaculture or regenerative landscaping or farming you're not going to  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:05):**  be able to see the results of your work in a couple of weeks.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:09):**  Some people don't even stay that long and so seeing the results of your work through  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:14):**  a couple of seasons is really the best way to get a feel of what your actions on the  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:19):**  site are going to result in and how it interacts with the rest of the ecology in which you're  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:25):**  working.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:26):**  Yeah I agree completely and that can be hard for people to make that commitment and it  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:33):**  can be hard to find a place if it's not your own where you jive with the energy there but  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:39):**  that is a good goal to have, I'd encourage people to strive for that and be ready to  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:46):**  say yeah I'm going to stay here for a bit, I'm going to see what this looks like over  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:50):**  12 months and commit to that through thick and thin.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:55):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:26:56):**  So now I know also that Masatau like you sort of touched on briefly earlier, Masatau has  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:01):**  a ton of educational opportunities as well as apprenticeships and much more.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:05):**  How can people find out more about all of these and get in touch with you and the ranch?  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:12):**  Yeah so we have a great website, it's just ranchomasatau.com and from there you can navigate  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:20):**  to all the different opportunities.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:23):**  We're starting to accept apprentices for our 2018 program, I actually think most of the  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:28):**  slots have been filled which is great and you can see our calendar that we're starting  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:33):**  to populate for the kind of the dry season, the busy season of 2018 and there's all sorts  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:41):**  of links there to other projects in Costa Rica that you can connect with.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:46):**  You can follow us on Instagram and Facebook, we're pretty active on social media, we try  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:50):**  to use those as platforms just to share kind of what daily life is like on a place like  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:27:55):**  ours and little educational tips and tricks I guess.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:01):**  So yeah ranchomasatau.com.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:02):**  Fantastic, so now aside from the ranch and all of its offerings, how can people contact  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:07):**  you and find out more about, well you told me you just started a consultancy outfit called  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:13):**  Pour Venire.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:14):**  Yeah that's right, yeah so website is in the works, maybe it'll be done by the time this  
**[0:28:20-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:20):**  comes out, I'm not sure but pourveniardesign.com so it would be scotgallant.com.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:27):**  You can reach me at that and yeah partnering up with a couple other folks, all been in  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:33):**  similar situations where we've been kind of putting in time at projects like the ranch  
**[0:28:39-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:39):**  and doing the on the ground work for five years, nearly a decade in my case and started  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:48):**  in the last few years putting ourselves out there as consultants just independently and  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:53):**  started realizing that a number of us were ready to take it a bit more serious, ready  
**[0:28:59-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:28:59):**  to open like an actual business and we're looking for other people who wanted to go  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:06):**  full time or close to the full time in that work and we're really interested in pushing  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:11):**  that forward and so yeah exciting and nervous.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:16):**  I remember being in that position.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:18):**  Yeah exactly.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:19):**  It's a great place to be.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:21):**  Yeah I've been doing design work for the last I guess three years now but ready to take  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:28):**  it to another level.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:30):**  Definitely well good for you Scott and thank you for being so generous with your time,  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:34):**  I got a ton out of what you shared through your experience and your advice so thank you  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:39):**  so much for taking the time to be on the podcast.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:42):**  Yeah it's my pleasure Oliver and yeah good luck in Guatemala, I had the feeling we're  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:46):**  in very similar climates at the moment.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:48):**  Indeed yeah we'll definitely stay in touch.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:51):**  Alright man take care.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:53):**  Thank you.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:54):**  Bye.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:55):**  There you have it.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:29:57):**  Now before we sign off for this week I've got a new weekly tip.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:02):**  This week I'm straight plagiarizing my good friend Shad Goodsy from Atitlan Organics which  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:07):**  is just up the hill from where I'm living here in Guatemala.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:10):**  The reason why I'm repeating his advice is because I get a lot of people asking me what  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:14):**  are the first or most important steps that you can take when you're just starting a new  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:19):**  landscape project.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:21):**  Now many of us who've been around permaculture circles will have heard that you should always  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:26):**  wait one year at least before you start taking any big action.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:31):**  Now the reason for this is that in that first year you'll learn so much just by observing  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:36):**  the land and listening to your ecosystem.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:39):**  You'll get to see how things shift and transform over different seasons and by the end you'll  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:45):**  have a much more informed opinion about what to do and how to design your project.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:50):**  Here's the thing, I completely agree with that and so does Shad, but he gave me a list  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:30:54):**  of three things, three actions, that you can take during that year of observation that  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:00):**  won't make major lasting changes to the land but will get you off to a much better and  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:05):**  much faster start once you're ready to start implementing your design.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:10):**  Now I thought these three steps were so important that it was worth doing a full segment on  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:14):**  them right here.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:16):**  Now the number one action that you can take is to make a nursery.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:20):**  Now this means starting all kinds of plants from seed and sapling that you can care for  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:25):**  and that will mature over the year of observation.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:28):**  Not only will you gain valuable experience starting your own plants and trees, but most  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:33):**  likely by the time you're ready to implement your design, most if not all of them will  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:38):**  be able to be transplanted into the ground.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:41):**  You'll also save yourself tons of money by not having to buy mature plants from a store  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:46):**  and then transport them to your site.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:50):**  Now the second thing is to bring in as much carbon material as you can onto your site.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:31:55):**  This means straw bales, piles of leaves, your neighbor's yard waste, sawdust, mulch, wood  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:01):**  chips, manure, whatever you can get your hands on and as much as you can store.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:07):**  All these carbon rich organic fertilizers will kick start both your soil building and  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:11):**  water retention strategies immensely and can even get the mycelium networks in your soil  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:16):**  booming as well.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:19):**  Now the third and last action is to plant a modest veggie garden.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:23):**  This shouldn't be a large undertaking like a market garden, but rather something that  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:27):**  you could replicate easily if at the end of the year you decide that there's another place  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:32):**  on your site that would be a better place for the garden.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:35):**  Much like with the nursery, you'll learn a ton from having the garden throughout the  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:39):**  year and you'll reap the benefits as well in the form of healthy veggies and herbs to  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:44):**  eat.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:45):**  This could even include small chicken coops or taking care of some small livestock like  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:50):**  maybe a goat or two.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:52):**  Even if your garden is a complete failure, you'll undoubtedly learn a ton from it so  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:32:57):**  that you'll make a better go of it the next time around.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:00):**  Now with these three actions, you'll be in the best possible position to jump start your  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:04):**  land projects when you're ready.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:07):**  People have learned invaluable lessons and have built fertility and water holding capacity  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:11):**  at the same time.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:13):**  So don't be daunted by the scale of possible decisions to make right when you get started.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:19):**  Focus on these three steps in the beginning and use the time in between to position yourself  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:23):**  for success in the long run.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:26):**  If you'd like to hear the full explanation from Shad himself, you can find his podcast  
**[0:33:30-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:30):**  interview at episode number 5 either at AbundantEdge.com, under podcasts, or on iTunes.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:38):**  Now for those of you who want to make a giant leap forward in your natural building education,  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:42):**  I'm now offering natural building workshops that cover everything you need to know to  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:46):**  get started on your own house in an intensive one-week experience.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:51):**  You'll get the chance to mix cob, make adobes, work with stones, natural plasters, and even  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:56):**  try out bamboo joinery and much more.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:33:59):**  We'll go over design essentials and project planning, all while working on hands-on projects  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:34:04):**  that benefit the indigenous Mayan population here in Guatemala.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-gallant/#t=0:34:08):**  This is a really fantastic deal because your lodging and food are all included in the course

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 07:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:14):**  So I know there's a lot of buzz and interest around agroforestry and food forests these  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:17):**  days, but do you really know what the difference is between an orchard and a food forest?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:22):**  Or how to choose the right species for your climate and soil conditions?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:26):**  How about companion plants and the various strata of a forest?  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:29):**  And if you're looking to make money and sell products, how can you make a business  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:33):**  plan and calculate expenses and profit from a system that could take years to mature?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:38):**  Luckily, my friend Jacob Evans and I will be covering all of that and more in our upcoming  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:42):**  course on Profitable Centropic Agroforestry.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:46):**  In the beautiful setting of the Spanish coastal mountains, Jacob and I will take you through  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:49):**  the practical learning experience of designing and planning all the way to putting plants  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:54):**  in the ground for a profitable, centropic agroforestry enterprise.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:58):**  Early registration discounts are now open for this 5-day course from April 13th through  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:03):**  the 18th, and because of COVID precautions, spots are limited, so be sure to register  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:07):**  right away.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:08):**  Just follow the link on the website or our linktree on Instagram for all of the details.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:12):**  Now, if, on the other hand, you already know what you want to plant and have a design ready  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:16):**  to go, I can help you out there too!  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:19):**  If your project is located anywhere in continental Europe, you can get the trees you're thinking  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:23):**  of planting and a group of volunteers to help you out to get them in the ground absolutely  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:27):**  free.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:28):**  I've connected with the team at Life Terra to help them reach their goal of growing 500  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:33):**  million trees all over Europe in the next couple of years.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:35):**  It's an ambitious goal and we need your help!  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:38):**  Whether you're aiming for reforestation, planning an orchard business, adding perennial  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:43):**  alleyways or hedges to your farm, or simply inspired to plant a food forest in your backyard,  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:48):**  we can help make your project happen with free trees and planting support.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:52):**  So, if you sign up through the link on the website, I'll also offer a free project  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:56):**  consultation to make sure you get started with a good plan and understand how the process  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:00):**  works.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:01):**  Just fill out the information through the link and let's get planting!  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:04):**  Hello and welcome back everybody!  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:07):**  Now I've got a good friend of mine, Philip Berker here, the co-founder of Climate Farmers  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:11):**  who's going to help me out with the introduction.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:13):**  Go ahead, Phil.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:14):**  Hey guys, pleasure to be here.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:16):**  Today we want to kick off a series of episodes that focus on the often overlooked necessity  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:20):**  of building resilient and healthy communities.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:23):**  This aspiration is as nuanced and complex as the natural environments we work in, and  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:27):**  what human communities are directly connected to and an essential part of these environments,  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:32):**  we also have a disproportionate ability to affect the resources, energy flows and even  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:36):**  the cycles and life and deaths of the other organisms we share the space with.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:41):**  So a major element in any environmental project should be the social and communal influences  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:45):**  nearby.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:46):**  And I've been fortunate enough to take part in and assist many projects around the world  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:49):**  at different scales and with different focuses.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:52):**  And I can confidently say that the ones I've watched progress with the most tenacity and  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:56):**  resilience are those that took the time and made the effort to collaborate with their  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:00):**  local community members and include them in the decision making process.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:04):**  And it's true that most of these projects got off to a slow start initially because  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:08):**  they weren't putting all of their resources into project implementation and work on the  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:11):**  ground.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:12):**  Over time, however, I've watched them flourish into impactful gathering spaces of inspiration,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:17):**  connection and hope.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:19):**  And I've also heard time and time again on the interviews on this show and from some  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:22):**  of the people that I most admire that investing in your community is the best use of your  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:27):**  resources and time.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:28):**  Ultimately, if you aspire to create a project that stands the test of time, investing in  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:33):**  relationships and social capital is always a wise choice.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:38):**  In that spirit, we reached out to a good friend and regular contributor to this show, Zach  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:42):**  Weiss.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:43):**  Zach is best known as a prodigy of revolutionary Austrian farmer, Zapp Holzer, and founder  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:47):**  of Elemental Ecosystems, a company that designs and implements water harvesting landscapes  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:52):**  and features for clients all around the world.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:56):**  He is now launching a new online learning community centered around the exchange and  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:00):**  promotion of knowledge around the regeneration of landscape hydrology called Water Stories.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:05):**  Oliver was fortunate enough to get an early look at the educational videos, mini-documentaries  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:10):**  and animations that Zach will be releasing in the coming months.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:13):**  And we highly encourage you all to sign up through the link on the show notes for this  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:16):**  episode and keep an eye out for those resources as they come out.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:21):**  Now in today's episode, we're going to be taking a different approach to the previous  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:24):**  interviews that I've done with Zach that focus more on the practical steps for understanding  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:28):**  landscapes and intervening to restore their hydrological function.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:32):**  In this one, we're going to be shining a light on some of the most impressive and impactful  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:35):**  water restoration projects from around the world and the catalyst that brought communities  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:40):**  together to advance projects that have transformed entire ecosystems and the lives within them  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:45):**  as a result.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:47):**  These stories span the globe and a wide spectrum of context.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:50):**  They illustrate the power of collaboration, especially when resources are scarce and institutional  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:55):**  support is non-existent or even antagonistic.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:59):**  If you've ever held back from starting an ambitious goal that had the potential to heal  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:02):**  massive areas of land because you couldn't get the money or political backing, then listen  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:07):**  closely to this session because it just might be the inspiration that you have been waiting  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:11):**  for.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:12):**  From there, we'll hand things over now to Zach Weiss.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:16):**  So Zach, let's start from the beginning with an introduction on water stories.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:20):**  You and I have had a couple of interviews on this podcast now before, and you've hinted  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:24):**  at the possibility of coming out with this platform for a long time.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:27):**  It looks like the time has finally come.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:30):**  I know that this education community has been a long time in the making.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:34):**  What can we start to expect?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:36):**  Yeah, it's been a fun, wild, twisty, turny journey.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:41):**  What we're really creating is an online community for water restoration practitioners, a place  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:46):**  for people to learn about the water cycle, to learn about water cycle restoration, the  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:51):**  issues that we face and all of the solutions.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:53):**  For people to get really inspired and excited by all of the examples, we have all of these  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:58):**  leaders from all around the world that have shown us a way to heal the earth.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:02):**  They've done it.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:03):**  It exists on the ground.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:05):**  So we're really trying to bring these stories to the masses.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:10):**  So we'll be starting with some animations that will actually release on the 16th, probably  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:17):**  have released already by the time this is released.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:20):**  Then for every week, we're going to be releasing a new bit of content.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:23):**  Some of these are short videos, some of these are full on films about different stories.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:28):**  And then that will build to the launch of our core course, which is really a course  
**[0:06:32-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:32):**  designed to train people to gain all of the skills that someone like myself has or accept  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:40):**  Holzer or Rajendra Singh.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:42):**  So that by the time you complete this course, you feel really confident and prepared to  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:47):**  actually come in and bring water back to landscape, to revive, to regenerate landscapes and be  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:54):**  able to really help others and yourself move forward with making the world a better place.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:00):**  Well, like you were just mentioning, there are some really inspiring stories that you  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:05):**  can already point to, to show that this is possible.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:07):**  You've got that series out on water heroes.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:10):**  Can you give me some of the profiles of people, especially who have done larger projects and  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:15):**  leverage the power of community to really transform the hydrology of their area?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:20):**  Yeah, these big projects are all about community.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:24):**  So I think the best example is the work in India with Rajendra Singh and Tarun Bratsang,  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:30):**  where they've revived seven rivers to perennial flow that had gone dry.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:35):**  They've restored 250,000 wells.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:38):**  They've reduced the temperature two degrees Celsius.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:41):**  And they did this by acting as a community, by starting these community water councils  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:47):**  where all of the individuals in a certain village came together.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:51):**  They discussed what issues they had going on with water, what resources they had.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:56):**  And then Tarun Bratsang helped facilitate some solutions.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:00):**  So these communities, one by one, year by year, started implementing water retention,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:06):**  the traditional water retention of the region.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:08):**  And it eventually impacted over a million people, causing reverse migration back to  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:14):**  the countryside because now agriculture was viable.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:17):**  The homelands were productive.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:19):**  And this is just one story.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:20):**  You look at Zephaniah Firi in Africa, where he started very much in a silo.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:26):**  He was fired, told that he couldn't work anymore, had to still produce food for his family.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:33):**  And so he figured out a way to do that by planting the rain and then using that planted  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:39):**  rain to grow vegetation.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:41):**  Lo and behold, the water sources started coming back.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:44):**  And again, people in the community started seeing it, started gaining steam, and it started  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:49):**  spreading throughout the whole region.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:52):**  And so we see time and time again, these big large scale changes when you're talking about  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:58):**  people from not having water, not having agriculture, not being able to viably live on their landscape  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:05):**  and having to flee, having to migrate for work.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:08):**  Now they have everything they need.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:10):**  They have water, they have agriculture, they have a future for the young people in the  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:14):**  village.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:15):**  And it's always accomplished by community action, by communities coming together, having  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:20):**  shared values, shared goals, and then taking actions to move in those steps.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:25):**  I really love these examples because they fly in the face of many of the sticking points  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:31):**  that I hear from all kinds of communities, even clients that I've had in the past where  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:37):**  they think that they can't get anything meaningful done for a lack of money, mostly, or a lack  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:44):**  of access to resources or machinery or it might be.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:47):**  And we're talking about some of the poorest communities around the world and almost no  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:52):**  money to work with, much less any machinery.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:55):**  How did they accomplish things at this scale without those resources?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:00):**  Just slow, steady steps in the same direction.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:04):**  Zephaniah's work is a great example because a lot of it just comes down to these fiery  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:09):**  pits where they're just making holes in the ground for water to infiltrate into the ground.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:14):**  And we've degraded our landscape so that it's rejecting all of the rainfall.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:19):**  There's no chance for that fertility to infiltrate.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:22):**  So just by making, he calls them immigration centers where he takes the rain and immigrates  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:27):**  it into the ground, welcomes it into the ground.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:31):**  And so, this is simple, simple stuff.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:33):**  We're talking a pickaxe and a shovel, or even just a digging stick that you can do this  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:38):**  work with.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:39):**  So absolutely, I think it's easy, especially for people who are a little bit more well  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:45):**  off in a global sense to say, oh, we don't have the resources to do that.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:50):**  Oh, we don't have the abilities to do that.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:53):**  And a lot of it just comes out of laziness or in confidence in being able to take those  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:00):**  actions.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:01):**  But these people who need to, to drink tomorrow, to eat tomorrow, we see time and time again  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:07):**  that they're willing and able to take these steps.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:11):**  And even if it's just a community digging up soil, putting it in baskets on their head,  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:17):**  and then carrying it by hand up to slowly build the dam, these actions pay off, even  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:23):**  if you're doing it on a human scale.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:25):**  So it's something that we all can do no matter what resources we have.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:28):**  If you have a body that can move around, these are things you can do.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:32):**  Yeah, and it really comes back to that community aspect is, you know, one person doing these  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:37):**  is going to take forever to make much of an impact on a landscape scale.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:42):**  But the tenacity and the collaboration that brings communities together when they can  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:47):**  see that the effects of their actions are really going to have bigger effects for the  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:53):**  livelihoods of everybody around, it really seems to tap into something primal that humans  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:59):**  have, all of us have within us that can bring us together and accomplish amazing things.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:05):**  That's what I really love about working with water is you see the results so quickly.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:10):**  The first rainy season, you see the results so people can get excited, they can move forward,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:15):**  they can have confidence in their actions.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:17):**  And so we see, you know, they scale really slowly because people believe in what they  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:25):**  see, they don't believe in what they hear anymore.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:27):**  You can find any information out there on the internet, anything you're looking for.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:31):**  So it's hard to know what's true and what's not.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:33):**  But when you see it on the ground and in reality, it's very plainly and abundantly clear.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:39):**  And so we see it big time with Rajendra's work where, you know, he started building  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:44):**  the first Johad, the first water body alone.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:47):**  He was a doctor digging in the soil.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:49):**  Everyone was making fun of him, laughing at him.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:52):**  You know, he was doing something far below his own class.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:56):**  Actually some people started joining and helping, but still not many.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:01):**  But then when the first monsoons came, the Johad filled, but then the well downstream  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:07):**  of the Johad that had been dry was recharged with water.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:10):**  That's when everyone said, oh, maybe we should do this.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:13):**  If we want water to drink next year, if we want water for agriculture, we should do what  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:17):**  they did.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:18):**  And so, whereas it went very slow in the first years, because there were very few examples,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:24):**  10, 15 years in, it started gaining steam really quickly because now there were all  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:29):**  these examples people could go see, and it started spreading like wildfire throughout  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:33):**  the region.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:34):**  And we see the same thing with our projects.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:37):**  When people don't know what's possible, they don't know to move in this direction, but  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:41):**  we do a project, the neighbors see that, they go, oh, wow, now they have water when we're  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:46):**  still bone dry over here, or our property burned and their property didn't.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:51):**  And these are really strong incentives to then move in that direction.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:56):**  Now I know that you're fairly well known for doing these larger scale projects on people's  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:03):**  farms or with a lot of machinery, you've been using backhoes and diggers and stuff in a  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:09):**  lot of your examples, but there are so many small things that people can do on a small  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:14):**  scale as well with like basic tools that you had mentioned.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:17):**  Can you talk about some of the techniques that you have seen really effective without  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:23):**  much technology or resources?  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:26):**  Yeah, for me, it ultimately boils down to going outside when it rains and watching what  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:33):**  happens when that water drop is meeting the soil.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:36):**  Is it being received by the soil?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:38):**  Is it being rejected by the soil?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:40):**  If it's being rejected by the soil, what can we do to help the soil receive that water  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:45):**  drop?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:46):**  It may be something as simple as establishing more vegetation so that the soil is not exposed  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:53):**  and hot and hard when the rains do come.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:56):**  It has those root systems of the plants to be able to actually move down into the soil  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:01):**  instead of just running off.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:03):**  So treating the soil, the catchment areas is really important.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:08):**  And then we've also taken so much space away from water.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:11):**  So how can we give space to water?  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:14):**  You know, we've drained the wetlands, we've levied the rivers, we've disconnected waterways  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:19):**  from their historical floodplains.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:21):**  So when we get these heavy rains, when water is flowing, how can we make a space for water  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:26):**  to collect and then infiltrate into the ground?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:29):**  So this can be a water body, a pond, it can also just be a rain garden.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:33):**  It can also just be a little hole in the ground.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:36):**  Anytime that we can give some space to water and help it move into the earth, that's going  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:42):**  to be a real win in terms of the water cycle.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:46):**  Now, even though all of these little actions and small design considerations are very approachable  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:52):**  to anybody, I know that a lot of people that I've talked to have not taken action on this  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:58):**  because of the regulations where they live.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:00):**  And those can be a real impediment, even just digging a hole somewhere, depending on where  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:05):**  it is, it may not be allowed, you could face sanctions or fines.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:09):**  And I know from the stories of your water heroes, that many of these people were pushing  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:15):**  upstream the entire time, constantly facing backlash from legal bodies and even surrounding  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:22):**  communities that did not understand what they were doing.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:26):**  What are some of the examples of how they got past that and were able to maintain some  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:31):**  momentum despite all of this pushback for what they're doing?  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:35):**  Yeah, it's really a shame in the sense of no good deed goes unpunished.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:40):**  And these people who have created incredible examples oftentimes had so many issues from  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:46):**  the regulatory authorities.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:48):**  The number one thing I see in the people that come out on top in the end is a real relentlessness  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:54):**  and civil courage to do what's right, to do what's right for their landscape, whether  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:59):**  or not it abides by the laws of humans, by the laws of man.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:04):**  And then also community support is a big piece of this.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:07):**  So you look at Rajendra in India, he was under house arrest.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:13):**  He had 72 legal cases against him by the government.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:16):**  He was basically a wanted man in India.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:20):**  And not only that, these water bodies that the community had made, the government then  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:24):**  sold the fishing rights to the water bodies that they had made.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:27):**  So they brought the water back, they brought the river back to life, and then the government  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:32):**  sold the fishing rights to somebody else.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:34):**  What did they do?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:35):**  They banded together as a community.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:37):**  They said, this is not right.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:39):**  And they petitioned the government and said, you know, you don't own the fishing rights  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:43):**  for this, we own the fishing rights for this, because we created it.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:47):**  And so if you want to fish, you need to get rights from us, not vice versa.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:52):**  And because it was all of the people in this whole region, all grouped together, the government  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:58):**  couldn't do anything.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:59):**  So when we're divided, we don't have any strength.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:04):**  When we're acting collectively, we have incredible strength.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:07):**  And in fact, they can't stop us.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:09):**  So this is a big, big reason why we started Water Stories in the first place.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:13):**  It's insane that we're asking people who are spending their hard earned money, and their  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:19):**  time and their energy on making the world a better place, to also break the law in the  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:24):**  process.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:25):**  That's a really big impediment.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:27):**  So what we're hoping is that through Water Stories, we can generate enough awareness,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:32):**  enough interest to actually rewrite policy to generate our own shock doctrines.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:39):**  So when the boulder fires come through and destroy people's houses, homes, livelihoods,  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:47):**  we can have the policy documentation ready to say, if you don't want this fire to happen  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:51):**  next time, you need to change the rules around people being able to infiltrate water into  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:56):**  the ground and rehydrate the landscape.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:59):**  At these points in time, when you have this disaster, these crises, that's when people  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:04):**  are motivated to act.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:06):**  So it's really important that we start having a real coherent effort to change the policies  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:12):**  that are in the ways of these actions moving forward.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:15):**  Yeah, there seems to be a general misunderstanding of infiltrating water into the ground is robbing  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:21):**  it from people downstream.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:24):**  Whereas it's quite the opposite, can you talk about what the reality behind that is?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah, yeah, we've got this system that's so set up on scarcity, where we view water that's  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:35):**  going into the earth as a loss, a loss to the system.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:39):**  And what we see long term is it's a huge benefit.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:44):**  Yes, it costs a bit of water that year, in the sense of you have less runoff happening  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:49):**  that year.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:50):**  But then it gives you more water every year moving forward, because we can either have  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:55):**  all of the water cycle really fast through the whole system, and then it's all dry.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:00):**  We can have the water cycle again and again, slowly through the system.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:05):**  And then we have year round water.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:06):**  So you see this as a great example with all of our big dams and reservoirs.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:10):**  Oftentimes we actually drain the whole watershed above to get all that water going to the reservoir.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:16):**  It all charges downhill in the spring and the runoff times, the reservoir is pumping  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:21):**  and overflowing.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:22):**  And then later on in the year, there's no water flowing into the reservoir, the water  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:26):**  sources are getting scarce, and we end up in a really bad situation.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:31):**  Because we looked at it as we had to get all the water into the reservoir, if instead we  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:35):**  looked at it as getting all the water into the ground, then that ground is going to be  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:41):**  slowly seeping into that reservoir.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:43):**  And so even though we're taking water and using it for our cities, it's actually being  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:47):**  recharged even several months after the rains have stopped.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:53):**  So we have to take a little bit longer view, multiple years instead of a single year.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:59):**  But as soon as we do, we see that this actually makes more water abundance, not more water  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:05):**  scarcity.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:07):**  It's a matter of fixing the cycle completely, right?  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:12):**  Rather than having these flash floods, drought periods, and then the fires that can result  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:17):**  from that, depending on the climate that you're in, it's evening out the distribution over  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:23):**  the year and the accessibility over the year, right?  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:26):**  And there are some key things that you can do depending on the soil profile, depending  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:31):**  on the shape of the landscape, there's all these different factors to consider.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:36):**  And depending on where you are, different techniques are going to be available to you.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:41):**  And I'm sure you've also seen examples of people getting a little over enthusiastic  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:45):**  and trying to put in big installations without really understanding the engineering behind  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:49):**  it.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:50):**  Why is it so important to really get to the practical considerations before jumping into  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:55):**  just digging holes and especially putting in larger features like dams and swales?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:00):**  Yeah, because every landscape is so unique, every climate is so unique.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:06):**  And it's really easy for us humans to find a pattern that we like, and then just try  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:11):**  and replicate it and stop thinking about whether it actually applies or not.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:16):**  And that's why I think this piece of going outside in the rain is so important because  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:21):**  some soils, you're going to have almost no runoff.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:24):**  And so if you have almost no runoff, a swale makes no sense, and a water body makes no  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:30):**  sense because all that water is going into the ground.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:33):**  So at that point, you want to do all the things that you can to increase the structure of  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:38):**  that soil, increase the organic matter, increase the amount of life in it, because all of that  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:43):**  life in its hydrophilic surfaces are storing that water when it comes.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:47):**  So even in a total sand soil, it can behave very different if it's a sand soil full of  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:53):**  life or a sand soil that's dead.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:55):**  The sand soil that's dead is not going to store anything.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:58):**  The sand soil that's alive is going to store a huge amount of water.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:03):**  Now similarly, if we have a landscape where it's all rock, we're not going to be able  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:10):**  to change the nature of that soil very much, but we can find areas that that water is collecting  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:16):**  and then find ways to infiltrate it into the ground or to store it throughout the year.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:21):**  So it's really important to not just fall in love with the techniques and think, oh,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:27):**  these techniques are going to work everywhere because they're not.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:31):**  Every technique has places that it works really well and places that it doesn't work at all  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:35):**  or even does the wrong thing.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:39):**  You know, another example I've seen is I've seen where people do swales and they don't  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:44):**  actually look at the different layers.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:47):**  So they have a fairly good topsoil layer intact, and then they have a sandy dead layer below  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:54):**  that.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:55):**  They cut a swale into that layer and now they're actually moving all the water from that top  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:00):**  soil into that sand layer and then losing it.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:03):**  So they're actually taking water away from the living cycles of the soil.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:09):**  So it's really important to look at what happens when it rains, what happens to that water,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:15):**  how is it handled by that soil, and then come up with your techniques based on that, not  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:21):**  vice versa, because it's really easy to do things the wrong way and make big mistakes  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:27):**  or just make big investments that don't really amount to anything positive or any significant  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:33):**  change.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:34):**  And what you said at the beginning too, your particular piece of land or the space that  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:40):**  you have access to might not be the place to intervene on.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:43):**  And that kind of goes back to why it's so important to do this at a community level,  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:48):**  because you don't have much say over how others in your area manage their particular parcels.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:54):**  And those might be the areas where intervention is the most useful or most cost effective  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:58):**  or whatever it might be.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:59):**  And so making a kind of a community level plan, thinking as a community and looking  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:06):**  at the landscape as a whole is always going to be more effective, even if there are some  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:11):**  small things you can do on your site.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:14):**  That's a huge, huge, huge point, because there are these acupuncture points within the landscape  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:20):**  where we can do actions and have a really effective outcome.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:24):**  And there are other places where we can put all that same energy and have almost no change  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:29):**  in outcome.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:31):**  And that's, it's just such a great point, because not every landscape is suitable for  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:35):**  a water body.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:36):**  Not every landscape is suitable for everything.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:38):**  So you can't fall in love with this idea of, oh, I'm going to have my swales in my pond  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:43):**  and my garden.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:44):**  And the reality is in the way our world has always worked is different pieces of land  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:49):**  are better suited for different things.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:51):**  And then people work together in community to meet their needs shared throughout that  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:58):**  community.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:59):**  So we really need to start doing the same thing with water and looking at, you know,  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:02):**  just because you want to hold water on landscape doesn't mean you have the best place for it.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:06):**  And if you open your awareness a little bit, open your zone of interest, you might find  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:12):**  that the neighbor actually has an ideal place that even, you know, could gravity feed to  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:16):**  your place, and you can work some type of arrangement with them where you share a certain  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:20):**  amount of cost and then share a certain amount of the water usage, so many different ways  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:25):**  to do it.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:27):**  But it's really important to look at things on a watershed level, where are you within  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:33):**  the watershed, that's going to inform what makes sense or what doesn't make sense.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:38):**  Whereas if you just look within the boundaries of your own property, you're going to miss  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:44):**  really relevant context to your situation.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:48):**  And I've been trying to figure out for a while since you and I have both traveled quite a  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:52):**  bit.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:53):**  And I'm sure you've seen the difference in levels of community level connectivity around  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:56):**  the world.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:58):**  And I try not to paint with too broad of a brush because of the importance of context  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:03):**  in each place.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:04):**  But it seems like the lack of urgency, the relative comfort and affluence that we have  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:09):**  in the United States or parts of Europe or, you know, Australia, Canada, wherever the  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:14):**  more affluent areas are, have resulted in a breakdown of community connectivity, because  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:21):**  we just don't need to rely on others nearly as much.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:25):**  And it seems that the people who make the effort, even if it's not a necessity, to establish  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:31):**  those connections and start to work at that collaborative level are going to be steps  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:36):**  ahead for when disaster inevitably strikes, whether it's another pandemic, whether it's  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:41):**  a natural disaster, and you need someone who's got stored bottles of water, or it's been  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:46):**  growing their own food, or even who has a medical pack that you didn't think to get,  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:50):**  you know.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:51):**  But so many other communities have not been having regular access to the types of resources  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:58):**  that we've gotten used to.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:00):**  And in order to compensate, they are very, very close.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:03):**  They work together really well and really consider things that affect everybody else  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:09):**  that, you know, that it involves.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:11):**  Is there a way that you have seen that you can start to establish that without having  
**[0:28:16-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:16):**  to go into a level of emergency first and incentivize talking about what the benefits  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:24):**  could come up, even if it's not urgent at the moment?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:28):**  That's a great, great, great question.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:32):**  And you know, I think we see it naturally arise in these crisis scenarios.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:38):**  You know, you look at like Christchurch during the big earthquake there.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:42):**  You know, you very quickly went from this community where everyone is separated and  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:46):**  no, you're you and I'm me and screw off, I'm not going to help you, to all of a sudden,  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:52):**  everyone helping everyone and I have food, so I'm going to share it with you because  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:56):**  you're hungry and you don't have food.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:59):**  So I think it's, you know, it all comes from this illusion of separation, where if you  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:05):**  look big picture, we're all part of the same living organism that is Earth.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:09):**  Earth is this living organism and it doesn't actually play out that what happens to me  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:16):**  is independent of everything else.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:18):**  It's all interconnected.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:20):**  But we've fallen into this trap in society where we think we don't need each other, even  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:25):**  though we do, because we're connected in a less direct peer to peer way and in a more,  
**[0:29:33-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:33):**  you know, you could conceivably still exist without ever positively interacting with a  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:41):**  human.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:42):**  You could order all your food online, you can have all your communication, you could  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:46):**  just live in your own little hidey hole.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:48):**  But what does that leave us?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:50):**  That leaves us very unfulfilled.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:52):**  That leaves us very unhappy.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:54):**  That feels us alone and trapped and no one enjoys that.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:58):**  So I think there's two ways of coming about it, the need is very clear and an easy way  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:06):**  to get people to come together when there is crisis, when there is need.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:09):**  But another way is just out of wanting a happier life, wanting a more enjoyable existence,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:16):**  because we are innately wired as humans to live in community, to depend on one another.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:22):**  And when those communities, when those connections are missing, we really start to feel something  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:28):**  is lacking.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:29):**  So I think you see this oftentimes too, that people come out the other end of the, you  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:36):**  know, whatever you want to call it, tech business leadership ladder, and then they end up wanting  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:42):**  to find community and something fulfilling because they realize, yeah, I did a lot, but  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:47):**  none of that left me feeling happy or fulfilled or like I'd done anything meaningful.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:52):**  So I think there's two ways to go about it.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:54):**  One from this position of need and another from just wanting a better quality of life.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:01):**  And for people who are looking to kind of take that first step and get things rolling,  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:05):**  obviously you don't just jump right into doing some massive community scale water harvesting  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:10):**  project.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:11):**  What have you seen as effective intermediary steps to build up to that type of capacity?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:18):**  Yeah, the place to start is working with your hands, working with the shovel, working with  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:24):**  your feet, because the soil, the earth is going to reveal so many things to you that  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:29):**  you can only get tactically.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:31):**  So you can feel the difference between clay and sand.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:35):**  And if you feel that difference enough, you can eventually see that difference.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:39):**  But when you're starting out, you can't see that difference.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:41):**  You can only feel that difference with your hands.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:43):**  And so if you start with a big machine, you're never really going to understand that difference  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:47):**  and how those different materials are used for different things.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:51):**  Whereas if you can start by getting really tactical, making even just little models,  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:57):**  say you want to build a big water body, you have this perfect place in your property,  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:01):**  you think, oh, that's perfect, just need to get the machines in and do it.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:05):**  First build a model, make a little area, you know, maybe it's the size of a small room,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:11):**  or maybe it's even much smaller, you know, maybe it's just the size of a tabletop.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:15):**  And actually with a shovel with your hands with your feet, do what you would do to create  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:20):**  that, then test it out, bring a watering can or a hose, give it a big rain, see what happens,  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:27):**  because it's even on a small scale, it's going to give you all the feedback you need.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:31):**  So then when your spillway isn't big enough, and it blows out and it destroys the whole  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:36):**  dam, it happens on this little tabletop model instead of the big version that you made and  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:41):**  floods the neighbor's house down the hill.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:43):**  So it's really important to, it's exciting to do these big changes with the machines,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:49):**  but it's not the place to start, it's only the place to go once you've developed those  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:54):**  experiences by hand at a smaller scale.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:58):**  I was actually just talking with Darren Dougherty about the curse and the benefits of technology  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:04):**  in a previous interview.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:06):**  And it seems like all the new technology is still trying to do the exact same basic tasks  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:11):**  that we've been trying to do, either with hand tools or our own bodies, or maybe with  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:16):**  the assistance of animals since time immemorial, however, what it is allowing now is for people  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:21):**  who don't have the experience or the understanding of landscape to do massive projects really  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:27):**  fast and the consequences that come along with it.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:30):**  And it seems like getting proficiency with, you know, like you said, the tactile feedback,  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:36):**  the analog methods allows you to establish an understanding of what you're actually doing  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:42):**  before you start playing with a scale that can go extremely wrong for having that lack  
**[0:33:47-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:47):**  of background and wisdom that comes from being very closely involved with the process.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:55):**  Yeah, and we see some really extreme examples too, where the management decisions are being  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:03):**  outsourced, they're being made by people without a direct connection with that landscape.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:08):**  So something I'm really passionate about and where I see the worst of this in the world  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:12):**  is water privatization, where we now have this situation where we're privatizing water  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:18):**  supplies, we're trading in water futures, and we're now putting the management decisions  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:23):**  for our water resources in the hands of wealthy bankers.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:28):**  And what do wealthy bankers know how to do?  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:29):**  They know how to make more money.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:32):**  And when you're managing water, in a water scarce world, water is incredibly profitable.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:38):**  In a water abundant world, water is not profitable at all.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:41):**  No one is buying that for a penny for anything.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:45):**  So now we have the situation where in some places in the world, the people with the management  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:51):**  decision-making power have no connection to that landscape.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:55):**  They will see none of the negative consequences of their decisions, and they are incentivized  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:00):**  to make economic decisions that actually are at a detriment to the ecosystem, to the ecology,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:06):**  to the communities living on that landscape.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:09):**  And so it's happening on a big scale and a very small scale where the people who are  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:15):**  making these management decisions have no relation to place or understanding of place.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:21):**  And so obviously you're going to have really bad decisions made.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:24):**  That's kind of how that works.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:25):**  If you don't have the background and the information and the connection to make a good decision,  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:31):**  it's not really possible to make a good decision.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:33):**  Yeah, and it kind of comes up with something I learned through consulting in other places  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:39):**  kind of far flung is that you can go there, learn as much as possible, put in something,  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:45):**  and it may work in the beginning.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:47):**  But if you don't teach the people who are stewarding that feature how to maintain it,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:52):**  how to continue to bring it into fruition, and as a consultant or as a designer, it can  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:59):**  be hard to charge for that ongoing support that is required and to include the education  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:05):**  in it.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:06):**  And for a while I took quite a few steps back seeing that regardless of how good you design  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:10):**  or install, the failure point, the weak link in the chain is often that maintenance.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:16):**  And people won't talk about that hardly at all when the sexy part of putting this in  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:21):**  is doing the design and getting the machines out there and getting a group to plant everything.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:27):**  But it really hinges on how you manage it.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:30):**  And these are long term investments and they require interaction, especially if you don't  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:36):**  want to bring in constantly more investments and having to dig out new things or put in  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:43):**  new plantations again.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:45):**  There is that opportunity to save money, but it is required of interaction, observation,  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:51):**  patience, and involvement.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:54):**  Have you figured out a way from a business standpoint to help to bridge that gap or to  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:59):**  make sure that they are maintained the way that you would have them?  
**[0:37:03-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:03):**  Yeah, I think it really starts with community buy-in and that is such an important piece.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:10):**  And so I'm really learning more and more to carefully assess my projects and figure out  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:16):**  which are the ones where people actually are going to spend the time and the energy and  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:20):**  which are the ones where they're doing it to say that they've done it.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:25):**  And a great example of what you just described is in India where this movement of people  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:30):**  restored the whole region, created all these water bodies and johads.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:35):**  Then the government, seeing this, wanted to take credit for the movement.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:39):**  So they actually came in and built some of these johads themselves, the government.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:43):**  They didn't talk to the community at all beforehand.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:46):**  They didn't figure out where the community needed them.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:49):**  And so you see literally side by side the exact same techniques.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:53):**  One is working very good.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:54):**  One is totally dilapidated and useless because the government never got the community buy-in.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:00):**  So no one uses it.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:02):**  No one maintains it.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:03):**  It's not where it would be useful for them.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:06):**  So it's dilapidated.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:07):**  It's fallen into failure.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:09):**  Whereas the projects where the community did have buy-in are beautiful.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:14):**  They're incredible.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:15):**  It's a night and day difference, even though it's the exact same techniques, the exact  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:19):**  same landscape, the same concept, that community buy-in is ultimately the thing that's going  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:24):**  to determine success or failure.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:27):**  So that's something I try and get to very early on in the process so that if I can figure  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:33):**  out that this is a project without much buy-in from the people actually living there, it's  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:39):**  probably also not really worth the time.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:42):**  Yeah, that's very well said.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:45):**  And there are so many ways to participate in this process.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:49):**  Not everybody has to have their feet on the ground and be there with a shovel, although  
**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:54):**  certainly that's accessible to almost everyone as well.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:57):**  What are some of the support roles and the things that people can do either from a distance  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:01):**  or perhaps they don't have the ability to be out there physically in order to support  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:05):**  these types of movements and projects?  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:07):**  Yeah, great point.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:09):**  And I think that's almost equally as important as the on the ground action, as funny as it  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:14):**  is, and really comes down to outreach and being an advocate.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:20):**  For example, look at someone living in a city.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:22):**  Living in a city, yeah, maybe you don't have any access to actually a piece of earth that  
**[0:39:27-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:27):**  you can do anything with.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:28):**  You're in a high rise up on the top levels, but what you do have access to is governance.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:33):**  You have unique access to all of the governance.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:37):**  It's always within cities.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:39):**  And so these people who are living in cities who want to do something, make your voice  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:43):**  heard.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:44):**  Be the voice for you and for all the people doing the work on the ground out in the countryside.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:50):**  So go to your town halls, go to your public meetings, be a voice for water.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:56):**  When people are introducing new legislation, ask what impact is this going to have on the  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:01):**  rivers, on the lakes, on the water sources.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:04):**  Ask what we're doing to recharge the aquifers that we're draining so quickly.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:09):**  So there's really a huge, huge piece just in getting other people aware of this message,  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:17):**  aware of what's possible, and then really as a community making our voice heard to the  
**[0:40:22-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:22):**  governments of the world.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:24):**  All right, well, I think the time has come to talk about your grand vision for the future  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:30):**  and what is possible with this community.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:32):**  You've set out a very compelling message in a recent video in order to launch this Water  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:37):**  Stories community.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:38):**  Can you talk about what you see being the potential of empowering, capacitating new  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:45):**  water workers and what this could lead to in the timeline that you've set out for yourself?  
**[0:40:51-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:51):**  Yeah, in the most ambitious, positive possible timeframe, I could see total climate stability  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:02):**  within a decade pretty easily.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:04):**  When you look at the vast majority of the heat dynamics on earth are driven by water,  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:08):**  we've neglected it.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:10):**  We haven't even recognized that we've disturbed the water cycle, that we've disturbed the  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:14):**  temperature and heat regimes as a result of that.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:18):**  And even irregardless of the whole climate change conversation and the temperature conversation,  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:25):**  what we know we can do is make healthy, abundant habitats where prosperity and peace can thrive.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:32):**  So these are the things that we can very plainly do.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:35):**  We can make sure that there's water sources for future generations.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:38):**  We can make sure that there's healthy landscapes that they'll be able to grow food on.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:43):**  We can make sure that the ecosystems that we all depend on also have healthy landscapes  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:47):**  to maintain their own populations, to maintain their own productivity.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:52):**  And we look at this movement in India that spread throughout the whole region.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:57):**  They went from 2% greenery to 48% greenery.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:01):**  That lowered the temperature two degrees Celsius.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:04):**  So if we do this same thing all around the world, we can instantly offset all of our  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:09):**  anticipated warming from climate change.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:13):**  But more importantly, the flood, fire, drought that we're experiencing, we can severely reduce,  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:22):**  almost eliminate, because those are two sides of the same coin.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:26):**  Because we're creating the flood, we're also creating the drought.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:29):**  Because we're creating the drought, we're also creating the fire.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:32):**  And so these natural disasters are not natural, but rather the results of our actions, of  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:37):**  our activities.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:38):**  And we can very quickly move in the exact opposite direction, because these are feedback  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:45):**  loops.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:46):**  The more we dry and desertify landscapes, the more we get flooding, the more we get  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:52):**  drought, the more we get fire, and it goes into this death spiral.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:56):**  But similarly, when we work with nature, we have this never-ending force that's a perpetual  
**[0:43:03-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:03):**  motion machine working in our direction.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:06):**  So all we have to do is set it off in the right direction, and then every once in a  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:10):**  while help it keep going.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:15):**  So really, there's no limits to what's possible.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:21):**  We can all live on healthy, abundant landscapes.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:24):**  We can regreen the Sahara, we can regreen the Fertile Crescent, we can regreen American  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:29):**  West, and we can reestablish a balanced climate.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:35):**  And it seems like there's a ton of very viable and attractive business options to do this  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:40):**  as well.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:41):**  Like this doesn't have to be a charity effort.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:43):**  This isn't something that we have to go asking for handouts in order to do.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:47):**  That there is a demand for this type of work as more and more people are switched on to  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:51):**  the importance of working with water for all of their stability needs.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:55):**  Can you talk about some of the business opportunities that you've seen in this?  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:59):**  Because obviously this has been your business for a while now.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:03):**  Yeah, just huge opportunity, huge incredible opportunities all around the world.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:10):**  And the reality is still most people have no idea that this is possible.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:13):**  So whether I'm talking to the person next to me on a bus or the taxi driver that I'm  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:20):**  getting a ride from, as soon as they hear about this stuff, they're like, wow, I want  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:24):**  to do this.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:25):**  Why isn't everyone doing this?  
**[0:44:27-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:27):**  And so it's this incredible opportunity to not just do something rewarding and fulfilling,  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:36):**  but also earn your livelihood doing it.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:39):**  And when you can do that, I think it just gives so much power to your efforts because  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:42):**  now you're not working your day job to then do this thing you believe about in your off  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:47):**  time.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:48):**  You're working in your on time to do this thing you're believing about.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:51):**  And so I make a comfortable living and there's more demand for my services than I can possibly  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:56):**  provide and the demand compared to what's possible and what it should be is still a  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:03):**  tiny, tiny fraction.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:04):**  So that's really what we're aiming to do with Water Stories is create these two groups,  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:10):**  create this new group of customers, clients, people that very much see the value in this  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:16):**  work and want it done, but aren't going to do it themselves.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:22):**  They believe in it, but maybe they're a retiree later in life.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:27):**  They're not going to get out of trouble.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:30):**  And then connect them with trained practitioners, young people.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:33):**  This is the second most common question we get aside from, can you do a project?  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:38):**  How do I learn how to do what you're doing and how do I do that as my job, my career?  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:43):**  And that's exactly what we make for our course is basically how do you do the job that I  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:48):**  have and not exactly the job that I have in the sense of there's so many ways to work  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:54):**  with nature, to work with water.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:57):**  I do a lot of equipment powered earthworks, but there's a million different things that  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:02):**  people could do to help repair the water cycle, whether that's making native and edible landscapes  
**[0:46:08-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:08):**  in cities, whether it's reforesting or establishing real forest instead of tree farms, whether  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:15):**  it's working in waterways, whether it's working in habitat, all these different fields all  
**[0:46:19-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:19):**  build towards the same goal.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:21):**  And so what we're very much trying to do is prepare people to have livelihoods doing things  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:27):**  that they believe in, using their skills, using their abilities, using their interests  
**[0:46:31-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:31):**  so that instead of doing something that they hate with 75% of their time, they're doing  
**[0:46:38-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:38):**  something that they love with that 75%.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:41):**  And then sometimes they're even going to want to do it with the extra 25% like me.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:45):**  And sometimes they'll want to have a normal life like other people.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:49):**  No, that's forget that just burn the candle at both ends.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:54):**  Nice.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:46:55):**  Well, like it, much like you were saying, there is opportunity for everybody's skillset,  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:01):**  everybody's experience to be brought into this and to make a positive change.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:07):**  We're only just starting to discover what the career paths can be.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:13):**  If you're, let's say a fantastic engineer or mathematician, or you're good at community  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:17):**  organizing or you work well with kids, like there is a way for you to bring your experience  
**[0:47:22-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:22):**  and your skillset to make a positive change in this and to do it to make a very comfortable  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:29):**  living.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:30):**  Can you tell us how people can find water stories and start to take steps to get this  
**[0:47:35-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:35):**  knowledge for themselves?  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:37):**  Yeah, yeah.

**[0:47:50-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:50):**  You can also find it through the water stories.com website.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:47:53):**  And this is where we're really going to be accumulated in all of this information.

**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:48:21):**  We hope people use the community to get this word of water cycle out into the general awareness.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-weiss/#t=0:48:27):**  Marvelous.

**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:02:32):**  Hey everybody and welcome to another regenerative round table.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:02:36):**  I'm joined with two of my best friends here in Guatemala on Lake Atitlan, Gabby and Charlie.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:02:42):**  And I'll let them introduce themselves in a minute because I'll give a much better introduction  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:02:46):**  than I will.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:02:47):**  But we're going to explore some of the topics that have affected all of us in our day to  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:02:52):**  day lives here in a totally different culture and a different part of the world than the  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:02:56):**  three of us grew up in.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:02:57):**  And I'm going to get the insights from both of them on navigating the differences in cultures  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:03):**  and changes of perspective.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:05):**  But before we get into all of that, Gabby, why don't you tell us a little bit about the  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:09):**  organization that you run here on San Marcos La Laguna and sort of what its intention or  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:17):**  service to the community is.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:21):**  La Campalacha is an arts and recreation program that I've been running from my house for 16  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:32):**  years.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:33):**  We've had different programs over the years.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:37):**  We've had times where we've worked with lots of international volunteers and other times  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:43):**  more with local facilitators.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:48):**  And what is sort of the intention of the organization and what does it do within the community?  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:03:53):**  Well, I was born in Guatemala, but I was raised in the States and I always loved dance and  
**[0:04:01-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:01):**  always had access to spaces where I could develop that and theater and creative expression.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:09):**  I never really liked sports.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:12):**  And here in Guatemala, there's a lot of support for sports and not so much for art or creative  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:19):**  expression.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:20):**  So it's about creating that kind of space and then making it accessible to children  
**[0:04:28-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:28):**  because I think it's important for kids who aren't interested in the arts to have spaces  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:35):**  for that.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:36):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:38):**  And we're going to come back in a second.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:39):**  I'm going to ask a little bit more about how that actually operates.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:43):**  But before we do, Charlie, why don't you tell us very quickly about your business here.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:49):**  And if anybody wants to know more of the details of it and his work and quite a lot about bamboo,  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:54):**  you can go and check out the previous podcast interviews that I've done with Charlie on  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:57):**  the website.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:04:58):**  So, yeah, give us a little summary of what you do here.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:02):**  I'm basically a builder.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:04):**  I help mostly foreigners who are moving to this area assess land and build on it.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:15):**  And I do kind of the whole thing from the architecture and engineering to the supervision  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:21):**  and management of the build itself and more and more the maintenance afterwards, more  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:27):**  houses I build.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:29):**  So the crews I use and architects and engineers, they're all from Guatemala.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:34):**  I try to use as many locals as possible.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:38):**  And I do a lot of natural building in particular, working with bamboo and wood and earth and  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:44):**  lime.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:47):**  And yeah, I built mostly in San Marcos, La Laguna and the towns that neighbor us on either  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:52):**  side.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:53):**  So in Pablo, La Laguna and Sunaná.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:55):**  Nice.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:56):**  And yeah, there's so much more information that you can get from Charlie in previous  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:05:59):**  episodes.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:00):**  He's been my teacher and my mentor since I first came out here to the lake.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:05):**  A big reason why I decided to stay here.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:07):**  So definitely check out his previous episodes.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:10):**  But anyway, getting back to Gabby real quick.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:13):**  I would love to know about how you think your organization like Amalacha affects the local  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:21):**  community by adding art and different forms of expression where they might be missing  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:28):**  in the public education system.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:32):**  So maybe what people would think the answer to that would be would be to form artists,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:40):**  but it's more about exposure.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:45):**  These kids, especially the first generations of kids that came to the Amalacha, their parents  
**[0:06:54-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:06:54):**  couldn't read, couldn't read at all, didn't have stories or books to read to their kids  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:04):**  at home.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:05):**  So a lot less stimulated in some ways.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:11):**  In other ways, they have a lot more contact with nature, a lot more stimulated in other  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:15):**  ways.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:16):**  But I think that one of the greatest benefits I see over the generations is the level of  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:23):**  stimulation that the younger parents are giving their kids because they came to these programs  
**[0:07:28-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:28):**  and they experienced firsthand the benefits in their own lives of having space to express  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:38):**  yourself to develop your artistic size to be more sensitive.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:46):**  So yeah, I've seen that in the younger kids, children of parents who were once children  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:55):**  in the program.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:07:56):**  And that's been really interesting to see just the difference, the level of confidence  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:01):**  that they have compared to the level of confidence their parents had as kids.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:08):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:10):**  Now let's take it a few steps back because both of you have been here for quite a while  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:15):**  and neither of you are from here originally.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:18):**  What was this community like when you first got here?  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:21):**  Because I know it's changed a whole lot.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:22):**  I mean, I've been living here full time for just two and a half years in the neighboring  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:26):**  town and I've seen some really drastic changes.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:31):**  So yeah, give us some context to what it was like when you first moved here and how you've  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:36):**  seen it grow and change over time.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:40):**  I've been here for almost 20 years.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:42):**  And when I first came here, it was a tiny town.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:45):**  It was just dirt paths.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:47):**  There weren't that many fences.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:49):**  There weren't walls around people's homes.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:52):**  And here I'm talking about the foreign community, the hotels and stuff.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:56):**  There weren't very many hotels or restaurants.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:08:58):**  There were some.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:01):**  Was there much access to utilities?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:03):**  Well, no.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:05):**  The first two years I lived here were without electricity in my home.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:11):**  Did most people have plumbing?  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:14):**  There was like maybe a churro outside the house or something.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:21):**  And it's interesting because I still see a few houses like that, especially more in Sunun  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:25):**  now where I've been living, but there's also really stark contrast to that now.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:30):**  So when did that really start to change?  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:33):**  Oh, I think in the first five years that I was here, big changes like the internet getting  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:41):**  here, people getting cable television.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:42):**  I remember that being a big noticeable thing and how that affected the kids' behaviors  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:50):**  and started watching Teleno Elas, Mexican Teleno Elas.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:55):**  A lot more drama after that.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:09:59):**  Yeah, it changed pretty quickly.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:01):**  I feel like I kind of got the last bit of that before the big development boom.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:09):**  Now, Charlie, you've been here for a little less time.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:13):**  Tell me what it was like when you came in.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:15):**  I got here 14 and a half years ago, nearly 15, and it was still very different from what  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:23):**  it is now.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:25):**  And I think the biggest changes that I've noticed have been in particular the development  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:31):**  of the tourist area amongst the locals as well.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:36):**  There's been notable change in the standard of education that they've got.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:42):**  It's gone up.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:43):**  There's a lot more schooling.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:44):**  And also just in terms of numbers, I mean, back when I was here, it was definitely less  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:50):**  populous.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:51):**  It's an interesting geography, the town, because there's the central downtown, which is the  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:55):**  bottom of a valley.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:10:57):**  The foreigners all came here and saw this beautiful beach and forest and started building,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:05):**  of course, in the most beautiful, obvious place.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:08):**  And all the locals live up on hills.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:09):**  And in 2005, we had Hurricane Stan and it showed all the foreigners why the locals build  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:16):**  up on their hillsides.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:19):**  And so much of that in the towns around here.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:23):**  It's only the foreigners that live at the bottom of the valley.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:26):**  In an earthquake and a hurricane zone.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:28):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:29):**  It was really daft.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:30):**  And I do too, because Gabby didn't know about that when she bought it.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:35):**  No offense.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:36):**  I had to put you on the spot.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:39):**  And people are still buying in the valleys.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:44):**  So most of the local population is actually sort of fairly well hidden and not very integrated  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:50):**  with the foreigners.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:51):**  The foreigners aren't very well anticipated.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:54):**  It's both.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:55):**  I mean, it's both ways.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:11:56):**  The geography is a part of that.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:00):**  And also all the normal things that you get with a tourist community in a local foreign  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:09):**  rural community.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:11):**  I think we actually needed to find that better.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:12):**  I keep forgetting, because I've talked about living in a traditional Mayan indigenous village  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:17):**  in Guatemala through more than a hundred episodes of a podcast now.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:22):**  But if someone is just tuning into this for the first time, we probably should give them  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:25):**  better context of where it is that we live and how the culture is different.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:32):**  Well, so this town has only had a road to it for like 25 years.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:43):**  Until then it was only accessible by boat, right?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:47):**  Or like walking through the ponds.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:49):**  And the boats didn't really stop here even.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:52):**  I think it wasn't a regular stop.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:55):**  I think there was a dirt track before.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:12:57):**  It wasn't an asphalt track.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:00):**  There was conflict on that track in the seventies.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:04):**  So I know there's been a dirt track, so you could actually get to it with a four by four,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:08):**  but even then it would have been sort of unparsable for some months of the year.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:14):**  And nobody was doing that.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:16):**  This is a Kachikil speaking region, right?  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:19):**  What does that mean as far as the geography of Guatemala and the lineages of Mayan, what  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:28):**  do you call them, dialects?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:29):**  Well, there are 20 plus languages and different Mayan groups.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:34):**  So this is one of them.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:36):**  One of the larger, right?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:39):**  It's one of the largest.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:40):**  And it's here on the lake, we have just two groups.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:46):**  So kind of one side of the lake is one group and the other side is the other.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:49):**  No, this is something I was always fascinated about when I first came here is you could  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:53):**  go two towns away, maybe 20 minutes driving or less, and there would be a different dialect  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:13:58):**  that you would have to contend with.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:00):**  And the interesting thing about San Marcos is that it's right on the border.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:03):**  So even the local language is kind of a mix between the two.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:08):**  But ethnically, they are Kachikil.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:11):**  But it's hard to give an actual picture or portrait of what it's like to live in a Kachikil  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:19):**  house even now.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:21):**  It's vastly different from what most people in the modern globalized developed world are  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:28):**  used to.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:30):**  Many of the houses are still Adobe with dirt floors.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:34):**  There's very little income.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:37):**  The windows are tiny.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:39):**  People cook over wood fire, open fire still.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:44):**  I got to see a lot of that when we were doing that rocket stove project last year.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:50):**  And see the different contexts in which people are cooking primarily.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:52):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:53):**  Yeah, and going inside people's homes, just seeing how few possessions they have on their  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:57):**  own is just a huge difference.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:14:58):**  I remember Gabby telling me about when she asked a guy who worked with us what the biggest  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:06):**  difference between his people and ours was.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:10):**  He tells the number of sauces you have on your shelves.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:13):**  Spices.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:14):**  Spices and shelves and flavors.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:16):**  They will have salt and lemon and chili.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:20):**  And that's about it.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:22):**  And clothes.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:24):**  The women's clothing is expensive.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:28):**  It's very valuable.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:30):**  So that's kind of the most...  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:32):**  The tools are probably the most valuable things in the house here.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:36):**  And I'll try and link to pictures or post them on the show notes for this episode too.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:41):**  Just because it's really worth seeing the traditional dress from this area.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:47):**  And would you compare it to the tartans in Scotland where different regions have their  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:52):**  traditional patterns for the female dress, right?  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:15:57):**  Yeah, and part of that was imposed by the Spanish.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:05):**  Because this isn't exactly how people were dressing.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:10):**  Pre-Columbian.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:12):**  But yeah, it'll be super rustic, the house, few possessions.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:19):**  But then there might be a huge screen, TV, computers, sound system.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:27):**  Yeah, that contrast is fascinating.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:29):**  I've seen that in a lot of other countries too.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:31):**  Like when I was in Senegal or in the Philippines, you had a lot of that.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:34):**  Although not as much Adobe.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:36):**  And it's not about poverty, it's about priorities.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:40):**  Sure.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:42):**  Well now both of you with your different organizations here in the same area, your property is split  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:50):**  between Charlie's building area and then the campalache at the top.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:16:54):**  What has been your experience, working relationship with the culture here between language barriers,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:01):**  cultural misunderstandings?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:03):**  Has it been very challenging or was it relatively the easy part of running?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:09):**  Well, especially at the beginning, the first years.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:12):**  I don't want to say that the parents weren't involved, but they were very, very busy and  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:19):**  it was a lot more street culture at that time.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:22):**  That was pre-TV in homes.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:25):**  So the kids were out playing on the street all the time and people were just okay with  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:28):**  that.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:29):**  And now you see that's changing and sadly some mothers rather have their kids inside  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:38):**  watching TV than playing on the street.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:42):**  So anyway, I didn't have that much contact with the mothers and the agreements were with  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:50):**  the children themselves.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:53):**  These are the days that we're going to have activities here.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:55):**  This is the time that you need to be here.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:17:57):**  They didn't have watches or calendars, so getting that down and getting them into the  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:03):**  routine of coming here regularly was a challenge and it took about a year and a half, but they're  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:09):**  always on time now.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:12):**  Yeah, and then with the kids also something that's changed a lot is the language.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:21):**  People are a lot more fluent in Spanish now.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:23):**  When I came here at first, a lot of the kids spoke Mauslica, Chiquit, and maybe some basic,  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:30):**  basic Spanish and some of the kids didn't have any Spanish at all.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:33):**  You don't really see that anymore.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:36):**  So the younger generation.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:39):**  Well, right now those kids are in their 20s, 30s.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:45):**  So that was tricky and there were things that I just couldn't come up with.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:53):**  I couldn't come up with these things.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:54):**  I couldn't imagine these things and the kids didn't have the language to really explain  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:18:59):**  it to me or really the confidence.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:03):**  They've never seen theater classes or circus classes or dance classes.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:06):**  They didn't really understand what was going on, but it was fun, so they kept on coming.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:13):**  But there were some exercises or some things that maybe seemed to them like something that  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:20):**  perhaps in the church they had heard that they shouldn't do, that it might be a sin.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:26):**  I remember, for example, a game where you have to go under another person's legs and  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:32):**  the boys wouldn't go under the girl's legs.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:35):**  And then finally someone was able to explain to me that that was just a local rule.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:47):**  You don't go under woman's legs.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:48):**  Which is not an unreasonable rule.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:51):**  I could see where that came from.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:53):**  But I mean, that's a well-known game in a lot of places.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:19:56):**  I've seen it in the States, I've seen it in Guatemala, in bigger cities, bigger towns.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:02):**  But that and other similar things to that, like you shouldn't step over a water line  
**[0:20:09-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:09):**  or can't throw the tortilla on the floor or your child's head might be really big when  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:17):**  they're born.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:18):**  And lots of superstition or beliefs that you just wouldn't imagine, that you've never heard  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:25):**  of before.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:26):**  Right, if you have no context.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:27):**  Yeah, so learning all of those things was tricky and it took some time.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:34):**  Now, Charlie, talk a little bit about the context that you've interacted with mostly,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:39):**  which is employing people on Buildsite.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:42):**  Yeah, well, when I first came here, my Spanish was pretty poor and I pretty soon got into  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:20:53):**  building and fixing things just because I've always been a bit of a handy person.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:00):**  And I remember Gabby giving me a lot of guidance on my Spanish at the beginning because it  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:06):**  was something I noticed a lot with foreigners when they first get here and they're not used  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:10):**  to speaking Spanish or speaking Spanish in this culture.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:15):**  They can be very domineering, bossy, loud.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:20):**  They make a terrible impression, something thoroughly offensive without realizing it.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:26):**  So for me, a lot of my work with working with local workforce has been about developing  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:36):**  my rapport and my ability to explain and understand each other.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:43):**  And Gabby's been a great help with that.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:48):**  She's helped me.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:49):**  And I often think in terms of helping foreigners deal with making the transition to working  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:21:58):**  well in a local environment like this, especially in another language, or even in the same language  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:04):**  with another culture, is learning certain ways of putting things and just learning some  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:09):**  basic key phrases about how to ask nicely for things, which in our own language, we  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:14):**  know well how to do, but they don't always come that easily.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:20):**  And especially with the intonation, just the volume alone that most people speak around  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:26):**  here is so quiet compared to what foreigners speak.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:31):**  I remember hearing conversations, how can they even hear each other?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:36):**  And whereas I'm obviously got a very loud voice and have a lot of confidence and I could  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:46):**  be very over dominating.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:52):**  So thinking about the context, so you've got this other culture and you've got this other  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:22:57):**  language and they've got their ways of doing things.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:00):**  I think there's some ones that are peculiar to Guatemala.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:06):**  There's a certain level of stubbornness and pride that Guatemalans, especially in the  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:14):**  mountains are pretty well known for.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:18):**  Well, they are in my book.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:20):**  And that was the first thing I noticed when I got here was I spent a lot of time in India  
**[0:23:26-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:26):**  and I came over and adopted the Indian way of haggling with local boat drivers and immediately  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:33):**  nearly found myself being pushed off the dock for trying to haggle on the price.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:38):**  I knew I was being overcharged, but the way I did it was in the Indian way, which is sort  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:42):**  of very jokey and at the same time, quite firm with your haggling.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:48):**  And he took it as a greater front and got very angry with me.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:51):**  I was like, okay, okay, okay.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:52):**  I'm not going to do that here.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:23:56):**  And the pride issue, I mean, I think it's great.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:00):**  It's great that there's a sense of pride.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:02):**  At the same time, sometimes people will literally cut off their nose and spike their face.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:07):**  I've noticed that quite a lot in my interactions here, especially with negotiations and things.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:13):**  Unfortunately, I don't really have that much negotiating that I have to do apart from maybe  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:18):**  with contracts.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:19):**  And that's usually a fairly amicable thing because it's usually with someone I know quite  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:23):**  well.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:24):**  But the, I don't quite know where I'm going with this question.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:30):**  Describe the context.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:31):**  Well, can I just say too about that with what you're, I think what you're referring to is  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:39):**  pretty specific to a place like this where there's been tourism for as long as there  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:45):**  has been here for decades now and the resentment that that creates.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:51):**  Because I don't think that you would probably describe people, mountain people and other  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:24:57):**  places in Guatemala that way.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:00):**  Right, okay.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:01):**  Thank you.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:02):**  I think that has a lot to do with the tourism and the resentment that it has created.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:07):**  Yeah, no, that's a valid point.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:09):**  I mean, that resentment, I think is something again, thank you, Gabby for enlightening me  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:14):**  still.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:15):**  It's a continual journey of discovery living here.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:20):**  That was, I think, you asked me what it was like when I first got here and what it's like  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:24):**  now.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:25):**  One of the biggest things I've noticed has been how little I really knew at the beginning.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:32):**  Despite my background in anthropology, which I've got a degree in and extensive travel  
**[0:25:37-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:37):**  throughout my late teens and twenties and experience with foreign languages and cultures  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:45):**  in both modern and developing countries.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:48):**  So I considered myself at 31 when I got here fairly worldly.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:25:54):**  And it's been humbling to find out just how wrong I was about that and just more and more  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:02):**  I realize how little I'm really going to understand of what it's like to be someone from this  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:09):**  town and or from anywhere else for that matter.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:12):**  And it's this gradual approaching that I'm trying to do to get closer to a better understanding,  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:21):**  but knowing that I will never get there.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:25):**  Sure.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:26):**  Now, as we've talked about the changes in the development in this town, the major force  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:32):**  behind that has been the tourism industry.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:36):**  What are your opinions on that in what it's brought and how it's influenced the town over  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:41):**  the time you've been here?  
**[0:26:44-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:44):**  Well, if you look at just a couple towns over in San Juan, they also have tourism, but they've  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:54):**  managed it in a very, very different way.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:26:58):**  And they haven't had the problems that we've had here.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:00):**  And the problems that we've had here are, well, I guess a mismanagement of the tourism,  
**[0:27:07-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:07):**  a lack of guidance, and a lot of young backpackers wanting to have a good time and maybe not  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:16):**  taking enough time to look around and see if they're possibly offending anyone in a  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:21):**  very small, very conservative Christian indigenous community.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:27):**  Yeah, because it's not just your average backpackers or holiday makers that come here.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:37):**  Markle specifically attracts a very specific crowd.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:41):**  Yeah, a festival, yoga, electronic music, or an ecstatic dance.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:49):**  Yeah, I think it's that contrast that might have been more effectual in this place than  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:54):**  just tourism itself, because there are very different vibes on each of the towns here  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:27:59):**  around the lake based on the type of people that their messages put out to attract.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:05):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:06):**  I mean, I know just living 40 minute walk away from here in Sununna, it's much less  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:13):**  developed compared to this place.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:15):**  And tourism hasn't been as nearly as large of a factor there.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:18):**  But as it's growing and it's growing extremely fast, the identity of the town is starting  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:24):**  to form with the people that it attracts.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:27):**  And we talked a little bit about the type of people that generally are attracted to  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:32):**  the scene here, and maybe that is an even larger contrast to the indigenous culture  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:39):**  here than everyday life from each of our respective countries, don't you think?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:45):**  Because it's a little bit more of an extreme expression of our cultures and kind of a narrow  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:50):**  demographic of it, though.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:52):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:28:55):**  These are also young people who can afford to travel as much as they do, and a lot of  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:02):**  them are traveling a lot of the time.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:05):**  So they come with, they're barefoot, but their teeth are perfect and they have laptops and  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:13):**  fancy cameras.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:14):**  Yeah, I don't know what to think of it either.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:17):**  I see a lot of people from very privileged backgrounds walking and presenting themselves  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:23):**  in a way that would imply more destitution and poverty than the people that they walk  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:28):**  around who literally have access to.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:33):**  A few dollars a day.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:34):**  Yeah, and I mean, I like walking barefoot.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:35):**  At home I do, but I'm not going to do it out in the town because 20 years ago a lot of  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:43):**  the kids didn't have shoes and it wasn't an option.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:47):**  They really didn't have shoes.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:49):**  And there's dog poo and there's glass, so they look kind of funny.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:54):**  So it catches me off guard, too.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:57):**  I don't know, it's a balance.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:29:58):**  I mean, I understand also the wanting to spread the freedom or the enlightenment or the cacao  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:08):**  experience.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:09):**  I get a little cynical, but a lot of it is beautiful and there's a really positive message  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:17):**  behind it, but you can't impose.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:19):**  And there's great people here as well, too.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:20):**  I don't mean as a critique of any individual.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:23):**  And I think that the younger generations are going to be a lot more open to it than their  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:27):**  parents were.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:28):**  We're already seeing that.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:29):**  We're seeing local kids starting to go to the tourist parties and having a really good  
**[0:30:36-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:36):**  time and enjoying that kind of freedom, too, that's not as permitted in town.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:46):**  What about you, Charlie?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:47):**  What have you seen that, I mean, obviously expats are your main clientele.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:53):**  So you've interacted with a lot of them and helped to develop a lot of the retreat centers  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:30:58):**  and private residences here.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:01):**  Talk about that experience and how the tourism that is being attracted here has affected  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:07):**  you.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:08):**  Has affected me or the local community?  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:12):**  Well, both.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:14):**  Well, it's given me plenty of work and given my crews plenty of work and all subcontractors  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:21):**  that we work with.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:23):**  So there's recognition of the value that they bring and it keeps us housed and fed.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:37):**  It's certainly a huge contrast what the locals here witness in terms of people's wealth and  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:50):**  privilege and some of them are very curious about that.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:55):**  Some of them are daunted by that.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:31:58):**  The great divide between the wealth does all sorts of things to people.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:09):**  Even myself, I was raised amongst people who are educated amongst people who were way,  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:15):**  way wealthier than me.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:17):**  And I do feel like I have less confidence than they do just because they have that spending  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:27):**  power and that ease of doing things.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:32):**  Even though I was raised among them, just having that much money makes a difference  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:37):**  and it creates this division that's in a way impossible to completely breach.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:44):**  It's been fascinating to see amongst my crews who takes the most advantage of it and it's  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:51):**  the more curious ones who ask more questions and who get more involved and take advantage  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:32:57):**  of the opportunities to learn and to earn as well.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:03):**  And I love working with those people, Vicente, one of my lead guys.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:10):**  He's a great example of that and Sebastian as well and they're constantly pursuing more  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:15):**  knowledge and more connections.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:19):**  The language is still a huge barrier as well.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:22):**  The tiny number of locals who actually speak English is gradually changing.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:27):**  That's taking a very long time to change.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:28):**  I feel opening that door and I really have been wanting to teach English to some of my  
**[0:33:36-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:36):**  students, sorry, some of the crews so that they can start bridging that divide too.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:45):**  I think that's already happening in the younger generation just through TV and music and movies.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:50):**  It is, it is.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:51):**  It's still a ways to go though.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:55):**  And yeah, until they can actually start to take on some of the client management and  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:33:59):**  be able to run their own projects and interact directly with them.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:03):**  And they already can if the client has learned basic Spanish, but a lot of clients don't  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:07):**  even have basic Spanish.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:10):**  And a lot of the reasons why you and I have come in and been able to be effective on those  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:14):**  projects is because we have experience working not only here, but all over the world and  
**[0:34:20-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:20):**  getting sort of Western standard projects done in developing infrastructure.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:27):**  Certainly the talent and the work ethic here is that I don't see any difference from all  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:33):**  the other countries that I've worked in, but the infrastructure can be quite challenging  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:39):**  to work under as well.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:41):**  Oh, definitely.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:43):**  And the ease with which we can get things done back in modern, over developed countries.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:34:53):**  Often I find that my role as a builder here is undervalued because people are just so  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:00):**  used to that and they think, oh, you just get it done.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:01):**  You just call someone up.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:02):**  Oh my goodness.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:03):**  Tell me about it.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:04):**  That's been some of my biggest challenges here is to accomplish things on time and within  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:11):**  budget in the variables that you have to work with here.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:15):**  And when it happens, nobody sees it because they're used to it getting done that way,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:20):**  at least out of the clients that I've mostly had.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:22):**  And add to that the fact that most things here seem to cost less and everyone is, well,  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:27):**  it should be much cheaper than that.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:28):**  So they're haggling with you on the percentage as well without realizing that everything  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:32):**  costs less maybe if you go by store, but you have to get it from the store to here onto  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:37):**  this remote site.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:38):**  Oh man.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:39):**  You and I could go on forever just complaining about all the things that people don't understand  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:43):**  about our jobs, but of course.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:45):**  What about you Gabby?  
**[0:35:46-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:46):**  What have been some of the biggest challenges that you've had navigating the structure of  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:53):**  your organization and bringing on help from the local community, explaining that vision?  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:35:58):**  I'm not great at fundraising and asking for support in general.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:02):**  So I don't ask for that much help.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:09):**  I get the parents to come in and we do recitals and shows for them and they come in every  
**[0:36:16-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:16):**  couple months to receive a stipend that we give so that the kids stay in school.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:25):**  At least that's officially what it's for, but really it's more about getting the parents  
**[0:36:32-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:32):**  to respect the schedule and not ask their kids to do work like going to get the firewood  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:40):**  or taking care of the younger siblings or taking care of the house because the parents  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:45):**  have to go run an errand in another town.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:51):**  And just valuing that space for recreation for the kids.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:36:59):**  It's changed over time because the younger mothers, they speak Spanish, whereas before  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:04):**  a lot of them didn't.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:05):**  So communication was impossible unless it was through a translator and more and more  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:09):**  we did have translators.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:12):**  I think probably my biggest challenge was to get over my own assumptions.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:19):**  Even though I'm Guatemalan, I'm from the city and I also spent a big chunk of my life in  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:23):**  the United States.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:26):**  And I was a young artist and I was probably a little bit too full of myself.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:32):**  And I think getting past that and realizing that that wasn't going to impress anyone here,  
**[0:37:37-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:37):**  that it was going to have to be through doing work that was valued here by the standards  
**[0:37:44-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:37:44):**  here and slowly making proposals, new ideas, and integrating them into something that feels  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:06):**  comfortable and at least a little familiar.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:10):**  Not too far out there that it's scary and people don't want to participate.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:16):**  The idea is not to be jarring to the local culture, it's to find a way to work within  
**[0:38:22-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:22):**  it.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:23):**  For sure.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:24):**  And you go slowly and you listen and when something isn't okay, you don't push for it  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:28):**  because it's about what people are going to feel good with.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:33):**  I gotta say that's something that I admire so much about both of you and one of the reasons  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:37):**  why I think I've learned so much from just hanging out and learning from both of you  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:41):**  is that you do take the time to listen.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:44):**  And I wish I could say that about more of the people that I know who have businesses  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:49):**  or live here full time is a lot...  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:53):**  Listening is sort of a humbling act, but it's absolutely essential if you want to actually  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:57):**  understand the context in which you're operating.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:38:59):**  And it's not just listening as far as what people tell you directly, but observing too  
**[0:39:06-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:06):**  when you could just as easily force through an agenda or an advance, some sort of idea  
**[0:39:14-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:14):**  that you had.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:15):**  Which probably wouldn't work anyway because people are going to put up a lot of resistance  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:19):**  to that.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:20):**  You say that, but this town has completely transformed because of people pushing their  
**[0:39:24-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:24):**  agendas on this place.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:26):**  Yeah, but those people aren't necessarily trying to convince anyone that it's the right  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:30):**  thing to do.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:31):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:32):**  And that's what I mean is you guys have done that.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:34):**  And I see big differences in between how many of the local community are actually here and  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:41):**  interacting with you and taking part in your day to day lives compared to a lot of places  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:46):**  just geared towards the tourist market and attracting people from overseas.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:51):**  So why has that been so essential to your lifestyle here?  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:39:57):**  Was it sort of a conscious decision from the beginning to open yourselves up to that and  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:01):**  really invest in your interactions in this town?  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:04):**  Or is it something that kind of evolved as you understood the place better?  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:08):**  No, for me it was for sure from the very beginning.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:13):**  That's what I wanted to do.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:14):**  I wanted to make a space for kids and art and games and fun.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:21):**  And so what first attracted you to come here specifically?  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:23):**  Well, I was a Guatemalan.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:26):**  You come to the lake for the weekends.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:28):**  I eventually came to San Marcos because there are lots of towns around the lake you can  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:32):**  visit.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:33):**  And it was kind of love at first sight.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:38):**  Stepped off the boat and fell in love.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:41):**  Started coming regularly, got a small piece of land and started getting to know the kids  
**[0:40:47-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:47):**  who just lived near the place I was staying and started bringing crayons and drums and  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:55):**  little things I could bring on the bus on the weekends because I was still working in  
**[0:40:59-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:40:59):**  the city.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:00):**  And I just saw the desire to participate and to have a space like that for my kids.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:09):**  So that definitely motivated me to finally leave the city and come here full time.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:17):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:18):**  I mean, I came in with, sure, my arrogance about some of my beliefs thinking that I was  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:25):**  right, of course.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:27):**  And I still have some beliefs of my own as well that not all people will share with me  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:34):**  here.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:38):**  But coming as I did from an anthropological background, from a sort of progressive traveling  
**[0:41:45-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:45):**  family, I lived in Algeria as a kid and we always went traveling and I was fascinated  
**[0:41:53-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:41:53):**  by, even though I'm from London originally, I was always fascinated by nature and people  
**[0:42:00-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:00):**  live in nature and the ideal of the hunter gatherer and recognizing that a big part of  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:09):**  humans evolution comes from that.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:11):**  And I've always felt very drawn to nature and knew I didn't want to live in London.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:15):**  So I very much wanted to live in a place like this.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:20):**  And the whole anthropological exercise is very much one of deconstructing oneself and  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:26):**  one's beliefs and making a deliberate effort to understand others.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:32):**  So listening is a big part of that.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:35):**  So also from my work's point of view, creating something, I'd worked in business and education  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:46):**  beforehand and something that was important, I realized more and more, and there wasn't,  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:42:53):**  it was a skill I wanted to develop, was the creation of a very healthy working environment  
**[0:43:00-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:00):**  where people feel empowered and encouraged, where they learn, where there's a good respectful  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:08):**  environment.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:11):**  And so creating that was very important that I saw to getting good work done, no matter  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:17):**  where you are in the world.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:19):**  So in a way, I already had some experience with that and came here with that intention.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:27):**  And if anything, it's just been a gradual development and honing of those skills because  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:33):**  I came in and yeah, I used to really annoy people and offend people with the way I used  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:40):**  to say things.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:41):**  And it's been a gradual listening and trying to, you know, taking the humble perspective  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:48):**  also that, you know, one doesn't have all the answers and that the more people thinking  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:52):**  about a solution, the more likely you are to come up with a good creative solution to  
**[0:43:58-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:58):**  a problem.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:43:59):**  The creation of that here has been interesting because the local culture doesn't necessarily  
**[0:44:07-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:07):**  work that way.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:09):**  Much when I worked in India, much in the same way, there's a sort of traditional way of  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:15):**  getting work done, which is you have a sort of very authoritative and authoritarian leader  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:23):**  and supervisor and sort of punitive measures to make sure everyone toes the line and gets  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:28):**  the job done.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:30):**  And I try to turn that upside down and to create the opposite of that so that people  
**[0:44:38-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:38):**  do feel empowered.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:39):**  And there is still a hierarchy, of course, we have to do that to get the job done.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:44):**  And I very much try to encourage healthy work practices of, you know, swearing and being  
**[0:44:56-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:44:56):**  a rural community, there's generally less swearing here and no drugs and no, just doing  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:06):**  certain things a certain way, like the way you communicate with each other.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:12):**  So, yeah, being respectful is what it boils down to and creating a place where problems  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:22):**  are solved collectively and really trying to create a good work environment.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:28):**  And I love that about my workshop and my office space where abouts, ooh, between on any given  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:36):**  day, they're usually between sort of 12 and 20 people working down there.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:40):**  And I love receiving compliments from people who walk in and say, oh, everyone was smiling,  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:46):**  everyone was chatting and they made me feel really welcome.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:50):**  They helped me get what I want.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:52):**  I take great pride in that.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:45:54):**  And the other day we had an incident where a newcomer who had a back issue had been hazed  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:02):**  by a few of the guys and that was just, they'd never been happened before.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:05):**  And they just treat it as a bit of fun because they were used to joking around each other,  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:09):**  but they hadn't been respectful of him and they terrified him.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:12):**  And he went and spoke to someone and the word got back to me.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:15):**  And I do have to get things like that in check and, you know, it takes work because they're  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:21):**  still young people.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:22):**  And bringing women into the work environment has been tricky in building.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:29):**  And I've had a few female technical drawers, but trying to get locals to open up to the  
**[0:46:35-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:35):**  idea of women working in construction and those more traditionally male dominated professions  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:44):**  try to do that too.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:45):**  We've got a ways to go on that.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:49):**  So with all of this observation and sort of insight that we've talked about up until now,  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:46:56):**  what would you most like to see affect this place positively moving forward?  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:02):**  Like what are some of the steps that could facilitate cooperation and healthy development  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:08):**  between the different cultures that have settled here?  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:13):**  Learning English is definitely one thing that could help.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:17):**  The language barrier is big.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:18):**  How do you think that would help most?  
**[0:47:22-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:22):**  Helps people understand each other.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:23):**  Helps locals understand the English speaking foreigners and vice versa.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:29):**  People can more comfortably find out about locals.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:33):**  That's one thing that would really help, I think.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:36):**  Well, either the learning English or both parties learning Spanish better because the  
**[0:47:44-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:44):**  local Spanish is usually pretty basic.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:47):**  Yes.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:48):**  Certainly the level of Spanish from the tourists is very basic.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:52):**  That's also limiting for both sides to really be able to express what they're trying to.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:47:56):**  I think also though, if they do learn English, I'll say one's better than the other, I think  
**[0:48:00-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:00):**  it'd be great if both were happening.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:03):**  With the learning of English, it does create more job opportunities for people from the  
**[0:48:09-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:09):**  town.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:10):**  Whereas what tends to happen with most rural communities and less developed communities  
**[0:48:19-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:19):**  when they find themselves the center of a tourist boom, they tend to attract entrepreneurs  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:30):**  from outside who tend to make the most money and that's happening in this town.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:34):**  So the foreigners and the outsiders all flood in and make the money and very little actually  
**[0:48:38-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:38):**  gets- Actually it trickles down.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:41):**  Yeah, exactly, to the local community.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:45):**  Entrepreneur training would be another thing then.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:48):**  That's something I try to encourage my workers is to not sell their land, but to build a  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:54):**  small casita and rent it out on Airbnb.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:48:57):**  And I've been encouraging several of them to do that and indeed some of them are slowly  
**[0:49:01-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:01):**  doing that more.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:02):**  Vicente being-  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:03):**  Sebastian, Vicente.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:04):**  Some great examples.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:05):**  What about you Gabby?  
**[0:49:06-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:06):**  What are some of the things that you would like to see kind of develop healthy?  
**[0:49:12-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:12):**  More local business owners.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:16):**  I think some of the young people who've been working with tourism will probably be better  
**[0:49:21-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:21):**  equipped to start their own tourism businesses.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:27):**  And I think they are going to be learning English and they're also, because of social  
**[0:49:35-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:35):**  networking, going to be having a lot more access to all kinds of information that's  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:43):**  going to help them run their businesses successfully.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:48):**  Something else as well is organization.  
**[0:49:53-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:49:53):**  The local community is quite divided and disorganized and disintegrated because of its history and  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:01):**  who knows what else.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:03):**  Well not just the town, I mean you could pretty much say about the whole country.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:08):**  Yeah the whole country, indeed.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:10):**  Goodness knows that's a whole other topic that we could get into.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:13):**  But also the segregation in the local community and lack of organization means that they can't  
**[0:50:27-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:27):**  fully take care of their community and their culture.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:35):**  It's sort of, that's not what I mean.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:39):**  What I mean is, compare San Marcos to San Juan.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:42):**  Like we were saying earlier, San Juan has been a lot more organized and it's managed  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:46):**  to, and San Pedro as well, the very different towns, the sort of tourism they receive.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:51):**  And San Pedro is a party town and San Juan is just sort of especially focused on weaving.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:50:59):**  It's been very organized with its weaving.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:01):**  A lot of artisanal good.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:03):**  Tours and visiting the cooperatives.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:06):**  No, you get a completely different feel when you go into it.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:10):**  It's like, oh this place is organized and you immediately...  
**[0:51:13-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:13):**  And many of the businesses are locally owned.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:15):**  Exactly, yeah.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:16):**  More so than here.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:18):**  And you'd probably be the same backpacker who feels totally comfortable walking through  
**[0:51:24-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:24):**  San Marcos in a particular style.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:27):**  Probably would feel a little bit out of place in San Juan.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:32):**  But equally the foreigners who live here, the local longer term residents like Gabby  
**[0:51:38-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:38):**  and me and you, the community is still pretty disorganized.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:44):**  And I think a lot of people who come to San Marcos are, and a lot of people who come to  
**[0:51:50-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:50):**  rural remote communities tend to be nomads and misfits a little bit.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:57):**  And we're a huge collection of weirdos.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:51:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:00):**  There are more eccentrics and goofballs in these communities.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:03):**  I love it for that reason.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:05):**  Yeah, and I don't think it's a matter of San Marcos becoming like San Juan.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:10):**  That's not going to happen.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:11):**  This has had its own evolution.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:13):**  And I think it's going to be more along the lines of the young people taking what they  
**[0:52:18-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:18):**  like, what's more attractive to them from what the tourism has to offer and then creating  
**[0:52:27-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:27):**  their own thing that works for them and for their own culture and syncretism of those  
**[0:52:37-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:37):**  two worlds.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:40):**  The organization of both worlds enables sort of healthier communication, I think, between  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:47):**  them.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:48):**  And also having a well organized local residents community can help create guidelines for visitors  
**[0:52:55-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:52:55):**  and more information sharing with those visitors.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:01):**  There's been some stabs at that by the community, but they tend to sort of, they come in waves  
**[0:53:08-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:08):**  and they occasionally do a little, but really so much more could be done.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:13):**  And it's kind of frustrating seeing it continue the sort of gaffes and culture clashes that  
**[0:53:25-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:25):**  we have by having all these tourists booming into town.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:30):**  I mean, the tourist season here is about three months long, the high season, and it takes  
**[0:53:35-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:35):**  over the town.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:36):**  But there's significant tourism here for a full six months before the rains come.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:40):**  Yeah, I mean really the whole year round, there's still quite a presence of foreigners  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:44):**  for sure.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:45):**  But the big boom that we're just reaching the end of now, it comes every year, especially  
**[0:53:51-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:51):**  with the Cosmic Convergence Festival that has started six years ago, brings in, that  
**[0:53:58-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:53:58):**  was a huge jump in tourist numbers.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:01):**  And also the types of tourists that we saw, we always had the freaks and the weirdos here  
**[0:54:06-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:06):**  as well.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:07):**  I consider myself a little bit of one of those too, but-  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:09):**  I do too.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:10):**  You call me?  
**[0:54:11-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:11):**  Yeah, you.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:12):**  Definitely you.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:13):**  I'm way too well adjusted for this place and I'm constantly being made fun of for it.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:20):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:22):**  I'm just as weird as everybody else.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:24):**  Don't get me wrong.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:25):**  You're just as weird.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:26):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:27):**  But that created a huge jump in tourist numbers and it was difficult to control how those  
**[0:54:43-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:43):**  people behave.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:44):**  In fact, there's pretty much no control.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:45):**  They did what they wanted and they still do.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:48):**  I feel like that could be steered and guided a little bit more healthily if we got a bit  
**[0:54:53-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:53):**  better organized.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:54):**  And it's not with a bad intention.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:56):**  It's just a lack of information.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:54:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:00):**  So we've talked a lot at this point about how the culture has been affected by the development  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:06):**  here, the way that it's interacted with the foreign community coming in through tourism.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:11):**  From an ecological perspective, what have been changes that you've seen in this area?  
**[0:55:15-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:15):**  Has it been positive in your time?  
**[0:55:19-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:19):**  And maybe what are some of the biggest ecological threats to, we'll say the sustainability of  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:26):**  the way that this is growing?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:28):**  I hadn't seen the lake get sick until...  
**[0:55:31-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:31):**  Yeah, 2008.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:34):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:55:37-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:37):**  There's too many of us pooping and using soaps.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:42):**  No, I mean, give us an idea of the lake getting sick.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:45):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:46):**  The algal blooms.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:47):**  Okay.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:48):**  So give a little context of what we've got going on here.  
**[0:55:51-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:55:51):**  It happens a couple of times a year and we have a cyanobacteria bloom.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:01):**  This isn't my strength, so I can't give you the scientific explanation of it.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:08):**  But it gets full of the cyanobacteria.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:12):**  Looks like a little green fuzz in the water, not something to swim in.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:18):**  It has fortunately gone away every time with the wind and cold.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:25):**  So to give a little more context, we're on a massive high altitude lake in what they  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:30):**  call a caldera, which is like a depression in a highly volcanic area.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:35):**  And we're surrounded by three major volcanoes.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:38):**  This whole ridge of the mountains that go through southern and western Guatemala are  
**[0:56:45-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:45):**  very active.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:46):**  There's a lot of active volcanoes in this area.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:49):**  And as we're talking about the sickness of the lake, the pollution, because it's a very,  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:55):**  very large watershed around the outside that drains into this lake and this lake does not  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:56:59):**  have a natural outlet via land.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:04):**  It's speculated that there's one that goes underground and deposits into the Pacific,  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:09):**  I believe.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:10):**  But basically what goes into the water in this watershed here stays in it.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:15):**  And as these communities have more than doubled in population since you guys have been here,  
**[0:57:22-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:22):**  there is pretty inadequate sewage treatment and there's a lot of impact from agricultural  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:28):**  runoff into the lake.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:30):**  And that's been affecting the chemistry of the lake and the life that can survive in  
**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:35):**  it.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:36):**  Isn't that correct?  
**[0:57:37-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:38):**  And it wasn't such a big problem before because there weren't so many of us.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:43):**  The tourists have gone up, there's been roads building, which causes erosion.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:47):**  The forests are being logged more, so there's greater erosion from that.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:51):**  Babies survive, mothers survive.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:57:54):**  And the population of San Marcos in 1986 was 850 odd, whereas now it's over 4,000.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:01):**  So the local population has grown enormously too.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:05):**  And so all of those factors have made this lake have to host a lot more people.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:15):**  And you can see that in the lake, you can see that in terms of the lakes health, the  
**[0:58:21-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:21):**  deforestation around here, water as well.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:24):**  When I got here, there was abundant water.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:26):**  There were rivers in the rainy season.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:29):**  Now you hardly ever see anything in the dried up riverbed.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:33):**  San Pedro is taking half of San Marcos' water because it doesn't have any springs over on  
**[0:58:39-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:39):**  that side of the lake.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:41):**  And there's more houses being built.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:46):**  One positive thing for sure has been the alternative farming movement, the permaculture and general  
**[0:58:57-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:58:57):**  respect for nature that a lot of the foreigners who've moved here bring with them and try  
**[0:59:04-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:04):**  to share.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:05):**  Yeah, lots of really good organizations that are promoting all kinds of eco-friendly solutions.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:15):**  For waste disposal, things like that.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:16):**  Yeah, there's a lot of NGOs and initiatives around here.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:20):**  And we're just a part of that in Sununu, especially from the agricultural perspective.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:26):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:27):**  I mean, fortunately, the hills here are quite steep.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:31):**  So there's a certain amount of foresting that's always going to be here.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:36):**  But just looking at firewood, if you go, if you climb up the valley here, you wait after  
**[0:59:42-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:42):**  about two hours, you go up a steep uphill and it takes you to this, what used to be  
**[0:59:47-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:47):**  cloud forest and full of trees and parts of it still are, but they've been gradually felling  
**[0:59:52-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:52):**  those much older trees.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=0:59:55):**  So there's fewer and fewer old growth trees here.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:00):**  And there'll always be a certain amount because of the steepness.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:04):**  I feel that that's one of the nice things about this country and one of the reasons  
**[1:00:10-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:10):**  why it's being able to keep such a high indigenous population compared to say...  
**[1:00:19-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:19):**  The colonial effects of other areas.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:21):**  From Belize to Mexico, all the surrounding countries really have far fewer indigenous  
**[1:00:26-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:26):**  populations than Guatemala is because of the mountains here.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:32):**  And it's been a lot harder to colonize and exploit the lands here.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:37):**  So ecologically, but along with tourism, I think one of the biggest threats is actually  
**[1:00:45-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:45):**  climate change.  
**[1:00:47-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:47):**  And the last four years, we've hardly seen any water, any rain.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:51):**  It's been gradually less and less rain coming here.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:00:54):**  I'm nervous about what that's going to do given the increased demand on water.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:01):**  I know up above Santa Cruz, which is two towns along the northern shore of the lake, they've  
**[1:01:09-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:09):**  just run out of water because they chopped all the trees off the top because of all the  
**[1:01:12-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:12):**  building.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:13):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:14):**  So...  
**[1:01:15-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:15):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:16):**  Springs start to die off and the rivers that used to run all year, now they just have their  
**[1:01:20-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:20):**  season or sometimes shut off entirely.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:22):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:23):**  And I do fear a collapse of the lake at some point.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:26):**  And sadly, with the corruption in local politics, the funds that have been made available for  
**[1:01:35-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:35):**  mitigation of that have been, yeah, co-opted.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:39):**  Misappropriated.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:40):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:41):**  Basically not spent on anything other than people's personal things.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:46):**  Well, so are there any initiatives or advancements around here that give you some hope that things  
**[1:01:52-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:52):**  might get better?  
**[1:01:53-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:53):**  Or do you think that this is moving in a direction that's going to be hard to recover from?  
**[1:01:59-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:01:59):**  I don't have a lot of hope for the human species in general.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:05):**  I have hope for San Marcos taking a positive turn in social development because I have  
**[1:02:14-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:14):**  a lot of faith in the younger generation.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:19):**  Fested interest as well.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:20):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:21):**  And I mean, there are also these new challenges that they face because they live in these  
**[1:02:30-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:30):**  modern times.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:31):**  The population is plateauing as well.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:33):**  I should add that population growth was-  
**[1:02:36-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:36):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:37):**  It's going to start going down because parents, young couples are not wanting to have that  
**[1:02:41-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:41):**  many kids.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:42):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:43):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:44):**  It's already slowing the population growth.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:47):**  But right now, over half the population of the town is under 16.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:51):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:52):**  And they're all going to grow up.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:53):**  They're going to be my mom.  
**[1:02:54-1:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:54):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:55):**  They're going to have kids.  
**[1:02:56-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:56):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:57-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:57):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:58-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:58):**  Interesting.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:02:59):**  So before we kind of wrap things up, can you give our listeners some insights in how they  
**[1:03:04-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:04):**  can get in touch with you, learn more, especially about La Cambalacha because Charlie's not  
**[1:03:09-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:09):**  only got a whole bunch of content with Abundant Edge in the past, but he's also going to be  
**[1:03:14-1:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:14):**  featured as a contributing consultant and designer.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:19):**  And I'll have that up hopefully by the time that this podcast goes up.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:23):**  But if you haven't seen it by the time you're listening to this, I promise I'm working on  
**[1:03:26-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:26):**  it and I'll get it up there soon.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:28):**  So let's talk first about La Cambalacha, how they can get in touch with you and support  
**[1:03:32-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:32):**  your efforts.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:34):**  We're always interested in volunteer artists coming to work with the kids.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:39):**  That can be just one afternoon or several months.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:44):**  Yeah, there are people all staying here in San Marcos if you're going to be coming through  
**[1:03:50-1:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:50):**  and you'd like to share some of your time with the kids, or if you'd like to get in  
**[1:03:55-1:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:03:55):**  touch with me, I'm at contacto, that's contact with an O at the end, at la cambalacha.org.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:07):**  If you'd like to organize volunteer, stay with us.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:12):**  Nice.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:13):**  And I'll be sure to put a link to that on the show notes for this episode as well.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:16):**  So you can go right to that.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:18):**  Charlie, do you still use your website or should I just direct people to ours?  
**[1:04:23-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:23):**  Why don't you direct them to yours still because I think it's time to shut mine down.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:27):**  Fair enough.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:28):**  All right.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:29):**  And I'll make sure that I link as well to opportunities to get in touch with Charlie.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:33):**  So thank you guys both so much for sharing your insights and your experiences with your  
**[1:04:38-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:38):**  interactions with this town and sort of the development of your own understanding of this  
**[1:04:43-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:43):**  place and the context and also all that you do for the community.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:48):**  I started by living here for four months while I studied with Charlie and I got to see day-to-day  
**[1:04:54-1:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:54):**  activities of the cambalacha, the way that Charlie interacts with the working crews and  
**[1:04:58-1:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:04:58):**  the natural building initiatives that he has around town.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:05:01):**  This was really the inspiration that kept me here for two and a half years going on.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:05:06):**  So thank you so much for all that you've helped me with in understanding and getting established

**[1:05:17-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-14/#t=1:05:17):**  We'll say goodbye but we're going to hang out again real soon.

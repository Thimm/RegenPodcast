**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:33:21):**  is at 250 meters altitude and the top part is 800 meters.

**[0:34:19-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:34:19):**  you're harvesting cardamom, which is becoming under shade because the trees are growing  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:34:26):**  and so it's producing a better quality cardamom.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:34:30):**  So as you produce cardamom, the cardamom plant is like a zingue berasse, is the family of

**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:20):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad  
**[0:53:25-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:25):**  Goodsy.

**[0:53:27-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:27):**  Oh man, so much is happening.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:30):**  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:33):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:53:36-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:36):**  in one of the earlier episodes.

**[0:53:43-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:43):**  and Abundant Edge.

**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:49):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:53):**  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:53:58-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:53:58):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:54:04-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:54:04):**  of permaculture design.

**[0:54:11-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:54:11):**  Yeah, that's for sure.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:54:12):**  It's life changing.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:54:13):**  But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,  
**[0:54:18-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:54:18):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one

**[0:54:31-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:54:31):**  know of available anywhere.

**[0:54:38-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:54:38):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:54:44):**  That's what I'm excited about, man.

**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:55:10):**  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:55:15-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:55:15):**  methods for years and years to come.

**[0:55:38-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-permaculture-chocolate-the-highest-quality-anywhere-in-the-world-with-lorenzo-maniet-of-el-porvenir-cacao-farm-045/#t=0:55:38):**  like right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan, it's one of the most beautiful places in the

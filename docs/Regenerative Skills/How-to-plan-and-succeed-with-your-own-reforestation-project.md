**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello folks, my name is Michael Pylarski.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:12):**  I'm with Friends of the Tree Society, which I formed in 1978 with the goal to double the  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:19):**  world's forest cover.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:20):**  That was always our main goal.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:24):**  And of course, since 1978, we're still losing ground, but more and more people realize that  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:30):**  we do need to increase forest cover on the earth for all those myriad of reasons, climate  
**[0:00:36-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:36):**  stabilization, carbon sequestration, the survival of humanity, and so many other species.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:43):**  And so we have a big task to do, and it's all doable.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:50):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:55):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:00:57):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:02):**  Since last week's episode was an expert panel discussion on agroforestry, I wanted to expand  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:06):**  on that theme and help to bring some practical and actionable information on how to plan  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:10):**  your own reforestation project.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:13):**  I reached out to Michael Pylarski first since I'm helping to organize and launch the Knowledge  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:17):**  Exchange Platform for Ecosystem Restoration camps, and as an advisory council member,  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:22):**  Michael has a lot of experience and knowledge on this subject.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:26):**  In today's episode, we'll cover the most important steps in designing and implementing a reforestation  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:32):**  project, whether it's for a conservation project or a profitable agroforestry enterprise.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:37):**  So let's dive right in with Michael's calculations on the feasibility of doubling the world's  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:42):**  forest cover within our lifetimes.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:45):**  I did a lot of research and crunched a lot of numbers and came up with what it would  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:49):**  take because it seems like such a big job.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:01:52):**  And so to double that world's forest cover at the time, this is 1988 when I wrote this,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:00):**  it was, I was, you know, it would take about 5 billion acres of land to reforest and that  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:07):**  would take on approximately 1500 billion trees or a trillion and a half trees.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:13):**  There's now a trillion tree initiative going in the world.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:16):**  And at the time, and it's around, it would take about 250 trees per person in the world  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:20):**  right now to do this.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:21):**  So you know, each person's share is 250 trees, not hard to do.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:28):**  The cost of doing, you know, the cost of doing this would be about a trillion, a trillion  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:33):**  and a half dollars at a buck each.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:35):**  If you look around the world at planting prices and it would take about, and that's just like  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:41):**  a fraction of, you know, of the military budget.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:44):**  So there's, you know, I guess the richest people in the world just added another trillion  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:48):**  and a half to their bank, banks and just since COVID started.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:52):**  So hey, you know, there's plenty of dollars, no problem there.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:02:57):**  It would take 600, 6.25 million tree planters to do the project.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:03):**  I'm a tree planter myself.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:04):**  I know how long it takes to plant a tree and various kinds of circumstances.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:09):**  So averaging it out, 6.25 million tree planters.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:14):**  There's currently 77 million people in the world in the armed forces total in the world.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:19):**  So it's just, you know, less than 10% of the world's military forces would suffice.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:26):**  It would just be a tiny fraction of the unemployed in the world.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:30):**  In other words, there is no problem with labor.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:32):**  We have, we have labor coming out of our ears and a lot of them would be happy to do tree  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:38):**  planting.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:40):**  So we have, we have the know-how, we have the funds are available and the, they're not,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:47):**  they haven't currently made them available, but the funds are around and the labor to  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:51):**  do this worldwide re, worldwide reforestation.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:55):**  So it's very doable.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:03:57):**  And so I'm glad that Oliver is here to talk with me about some of the more of the particulars  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:04):**  of how we can go about this.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:06):**  From those calculations, you can see a bit of a clear roadmap to reaching the lofty goal  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:11):**  of dramatically increasing the world's forest cover.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:14):**  Though there are a lot of implementation roadblocks in that simplified range of statistics, you  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:19):**  can still clearly see that we don't lack the resources as a global community to get this  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:23):**  done.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:24):**  So let's start planning.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:25):**  What are some of the most important things that we need to take stock of in order to  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:30):**  have a good shot at success in a tree planting initiative?  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:34):**  Well, the first identify some projects in your neighborhood.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:38):**  What would you like to attack?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:39):**  What could you attempt?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:41):**  People can start, you know, put a few things in their backyard and pick a project in the  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:47):**  urban area or a rural area.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:50):**  What, what, what could be done in your area that you could, that you could actually get  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:55):**  to on a personal level?  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:04:58):**  And once you've identified the site, you'll have to do some planning, what kind of trees  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:04):**  are you going to use?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:07):**  What kind of techniques are you going to use?  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:10):**  What kind of budget would you need?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:12):**  And a lot of this could be done, I would say volunteer.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:14):**  I mean, and this is happening around the world.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:18):**  Local people get together, they pick a project that they want to improve the local neighborhood,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:23):**  and they use in kind donations and volunteer labor.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:30):**  And so it can be done on a pretty small, you might say a small budget for the small little  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:36):**  achievable goals here.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:39):**  And every single, you know, worldwide reforestation will only be accomplished one tree at a time.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:45):**  And so they all add up.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:47):**  And so a lot of it's inevitably going to be a lot of small projects.  
**[0:05:52-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:05:52):**  There's a guy in India, and I can't, some guru there and, and he at one point organized  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:01):**  a one day tree planting across I think it was a state of either Maharashtra or Karnataka.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:07):**  I don't have the figures in front of me, but he, they planted the world record of number  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:15):**  of trees planted, you know, deliberately in one day.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:18):**  And it was in the millions of trees.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:20):**  And so he just got all these people just to come out from their villages, and just plant  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:26):**  trees locally, and they and they broke the world record of number of trees.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:30):**  Now that record has now been broken by the Philippines, they said, we're not going to  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:34):**  let India get ahead of us.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:35):**  So now the Philippines has did an even bigger day tree planting date.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:41):**  And so here's a case where a lot of trees can go in at on the same day.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:46):**  And this is pretty much volunteer, the the they have to say, well, where do they get  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:55):**  the trees that quickly?  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:06:56):**  Well, they must have planned ahead, because, you know, it usually takes one or two years  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:01):**  ahead of time to get the trees planted and ready for reforestation, or to get implanted.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:08):**  Now there's another whole range of techniques called direct seeding of trees where you just  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:14):**  plant the seed.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:15):**  In other words, you don't have to actually grow the trees and go out there with a shovel  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:18):**  or a hodad and plant those trees, you can actually, a lot of the worldwide reforestation  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:24):**  can be done through seeding, which is a lot, you might say, easier, quicker, cheaper.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:30):**  And so that's another that's another whole way that you can do this reforestation.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:36):**  Perfect.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:37):**  That gives us a good starting point.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:39):**  But now let's look at one of the aspects that can kind of trip people up.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:42):**  And that's choosing the types of trees to plant.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:45):**  I'm assuming here that most people listening to this are not aspiring to plant timber plantation  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:50):**  monocultures, and so they won't likely be looking at the fastest growing trees with  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:55):**  the highest harvest turnover.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:07:57):**  If we're aiming to return health and biodiversity to our landscapes, and perhaps even grow some  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:02):**  delicious food in the process, how should we begin to learn about the options for trees  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:07):**  that grow best in our bioregion?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:10):**  There's tons of books that will give you lots of this kind of information.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:14):**  But one of the best things to do is to actually do a horticultural, what I call a horticultural  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:17):**  survey of the area.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:19):**  What are all the trees growing there now and that are doing well?  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:23):**  If you've got a list, if you've got, oh, let's say a list of 15, 20 trees that are just really  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:29):**  very successful in that environment and that climate, then, and you can actually go down  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:34):**  to microclimate, then you can feel pretty safe.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:40):**  And but so one, they have to be able to survive their cold, hearty, etc, etc.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:49):**  And another big part of the planning, though, is what are you trying to get out of the tree  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:08:59):**  planting?  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:00):**  You're just trying to get trees.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:01):**  See, I'm a trained permaculturist.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:02):**  And I think you probably know about that some too, Oliver.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:05):**  But in permaculture, we're trained to create fully functional ecosystems.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:11):**  But at the same time, they're going to help provide for the people that live there.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:14):**  So a lot of parts of the world, they can't just say, oh, we're just going to plant these  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:17):**  trees and stand back and get nothing out of them.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:19):**  In places like Africa, India, and even in some more developed countries, people want  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:25):**  to get a yield.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:27):**  And especially if we're planting trees on farm fields, there's a lot of a lot of our  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:32):**  reforestation is actually going to take place, not just on degraded, abandoned lands, but  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:38):**  also on farm fields.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:40):**  So how do we actually make that farmer more money on that tree planting than they were  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:45):**  going to get with their cropping?  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:47):**  And so that's where you get into agroforestry and permaculture systems.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:51):**  And we say, oh, we're going to plant a bunch of trees that provide fruits, nuts, medicines,  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:09:57):**  insects, that will pay that they will, it will help the local people subsist or create  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:04):**  income.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:05):**  So a lot of the plantings I do are designed not only to get trees in the ground, but to  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:12):**  be productive assets for the human community that live there and create more resources.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:19):**  So what we're trying to do in the world is not just plant trees per se, but we're also  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:23):**  trying to really increase the amount of natural resources because natural resources are going  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:28):**  down, down, down in the world and populations going up, up, up.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:32):**  And it doesn't take a crystal ball to know that there's a problem.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:36):**  There's a big problem coming down the pipeline.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:38):**  And in many parts of the world, the problem is already there.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:43):**  Famine is knocking on the door.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:47):**  And so we better plant food plants as part of this whole overall worldwide reforestation.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:53):**  Okay, so now we've created a plan and selected our tree species.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:10:57):**  But there's still a big problem with a lot of major tree planting and afforestation projects  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:02):**  that I want everybody listening to be able to avoid.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:05):**  Now it turns out that the sapling trees that are planted are often very delicate and vulnerable  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:10):**  in their early stage of life.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:12):**  I know that the first three years after planting are often when the highest failure rate occurs.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:17):**  And especially in degraded soils and damaged landscapes, trees are even more susceptible.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:23):**  This could mean that a very large percentage of the trees don't survive.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:27):**  And then we just have to start over again and we'll have lost money in the process.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:32):**  How can we do everything possible to ensure that the trees that we plant actually survive  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:38):**  to become a forest?  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:40):**  Well, what you're saying is very true.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:43):**  And it's interesting that if you look back into communist China, they had a in their  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:48):**  big leap forward era, they did a gigantic amount of plantings in the in the country.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:54):**  And some of them, you know, would have had, you know, like 100% failure rate, you know,  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:11:58):**  they would plant them and they would all die or most of them would die.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:02):**  And there's a lot of projects like that in the world that they like, they're kind of  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:05):**  going for the glamour.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:06):**  This might be where like, oh, we're gonna plant all these trees in one day, then we're  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:10):**  going to walk away and hope that they make it.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:14):**  So the follow up care might be more, you might say, expensive and time consuming than the  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:22):**  actual planting.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:23):**  And so if you plant them correctly in the first place, they're more likely to survive.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:29):**  And if you plant them at the right time, the more arid the region is, and especially if  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:34):**  you're relying on rainfall, the timing is incredibly important.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:40):**  And here in the Pacific Northwest, where I've done tree planting in the inland Northwest  
**[0:12:46-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:46):**  semi arid regions, you have to get those things planted during right at the beginning of the  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:12:54):**  rainy season, the spring rainy season in our case, and then there there's enough water  
**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:01):**  and rain to get them established before the dry the first really big dry period comes.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:08):**  And so we could get 90 95% success rate, but the time but if we if we waited too late into  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:15):**  the season, we could have a total failure.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:18):**  So the timing in a lot of these things is critical.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:23):**  And then there's a lot of things you can do to make sure that they do survive and, and  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:27):**  so planting correctly, I mean, you can stick a tree in the ground incorrectly and J rid  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:32):**  them and they just going to die.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:34):**  Or you can put them in with a nice straight tap right down there.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:38):**  Not all trees, but most a lot of trees have a single tap root, especially conifers.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:44):**  And with you stick that in the shallow hole and the and, and the returns into a J, you  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:50):**  know, the instead of pointing straight down and all of a sudden is pointing the end of  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:53):**  the root is pointing up, it has a hard time writing that you know, it's not totally a  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:13:59):**  death sentence, but generally in their conifer plantings that oftentimes is.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:03):**  So you want your it's better to shorten the route so that it fits the whole rather than  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:09):**  to stick too long a route into the hole.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:12):**  Some trees, of course, have a more fibrous ride ranging system and it's not as likely  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:19):**  to be a problem.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:20):**  So it varies on the species, but you don't want to J root.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:24):**  That's what we call it in the trade.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:26):**  You don't want to J with those trees.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:28):**  If you have a really long route and you might say shallow hole, you can always try for a  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:32):**  bigger hole, but sometimes it's rocks or various reasons that you can't get as deep.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:37):**  So you can, so you can trim that root, you might say to fit the whole.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:42):**  I mean, there's a limit to what you can do.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:44):**  You can't cut off almost the more root, of course, the better.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:48):**  But some trees are much better at surviving with small amounts of roots and others are.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:53):**  So again, it's very species dependent.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:14:56):**  Some trees need so little risk that we can do what we call live staking.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:01):**  And that is where you just take a cutting or a pole and without any roots and you just  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:08):**  make a hole in the ground and shove that in and it will root.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:12):**  The cutting will root into the ground, moisture, enough moisture, et cetera.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:17):**  And in Mongolia, they had situations where they were reforesting along riparian zones,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:25):**  no trees, super dry.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:28):**  They had water at, let's say, 12 feet down.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:33):**  And you could, and the only, so what they did is they had developed a special machine  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:36):**  that would bore a really narrow hole 12 feet down into the ground.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:42):**  And then they would shove these long poplar poles that were like 15 feet long and down  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:48):**  into the hole so that the butt end was down in that water zone.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:52):**  And there's still some sticking up and those would rip.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:56):**  And so that's a form of live staking.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:15:59):**  Usually staking means that you take something, oh, two, three inches in diameter, sharpen  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:05):**  one end, and you actually drive it in with a sledgehammer into a slope.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:09):**  There's enough water that it will root from the bottom and grow.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:13):**  So live staking, cuttings, and drilling holes to get long poles into the groundwater, those  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:20):**  are all types of tree planting.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:24):**  What are some of the ways that we can take care of the soil that we're planting the trees  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:27):**  into, especially if we know that it's deficient and maybe lacking in nutrients or, of course,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:33):**  the ability to hold water, which is essential?  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:37):**  Mulching can be a really big help.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:42):**  Fertilizing adding fertilizer if your soil is not up to snuff and certain things and  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:46):**  you want fast growth.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:48):**  Generally, I'm thinking mineral fertilizers.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:50):**  It could also be nitrogen fertilizers, but I'm a Mr. Organic, one of the founders of  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:16:56):**  the organic movement here in the US actually, way back in 1972.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:02):**  So I'm organic all the way.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:04):**  And so when I say fertilizer, I am not referring to chemical fertilizers.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:09):**  So if I was doing a reforestation project in a tough situation and I had some chemical  
**[0:17:14-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:14):**  fertilizers and a shortage of natural fertilizers, I wouldn't turn up my nose at a little chemical  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:22):**  fertilizer to help trees get established in the initial stage.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:27):**  Shading could be really helpful, especially in a hot dry system place.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:32):**  Those trees can fry the first year, but by putting up a shade in the northwest, a lot  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:37):**  of times it was a cedar shake or shingles, small shingle on a stake that you drove the  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:43):**  stake onto in the ground.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:45):**  It could be cardboard.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:47):**  They tend to melt a little quicker.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:49):**  It could be just piling up some brush on the south side if you're in the northern hemisphere,  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:56):**  the north side if you're in the southern hemisphere.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:17:58):**  So shading can make all the difference in the world.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:02):**  Sometimes in a lot of places in the world, unfortunately, you have to protect them from  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:07):**  getting eaten.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:08):**  You could plant a bunch of trees and the neighbors, goats and cows, et cetera, just go out there  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:12):**  and just eat them all up.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:15):**  And so in some cases it's fencing or putting thorny branches around them.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:21):**  I was in Nepal and I have some great shots of this, photos of there.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:28):**  Here's a pasture with these cows and goats wandering.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:31):**  We're going to say cows, you better stay away from goats here.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:35):**  Cows wandering around in the field and there is these trees, these towering trees that  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:40):**  were like on these pedestals that were way up where the browsing animals, the cows couldn't  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:47):**  reach them.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:48):**  And what they had done there is they had piled up, made a tower of stones that they had planted.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:18:58):**  They had a bunch of soil sort of down the middle of it and down the core of it.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:03):**  And they planted the tree, oh, like five feet above the level of the field.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:08):**  And as the tree grew, it's rich totally encased that stone.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:12):**  And it was just sitting there as a tall tree in a pasture of cows where they couldn't eat  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:19):**  it.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:20):**  So that's a tremendous amount of effort to go to, to keep the trees out of the browsing  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:24):**  animals height.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:25):**  I don't know if there's anywhere else in the world except in Nepal where some would go  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:31):**  to such extremes.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:32):**  But that's an idea of getting, usually a lot of times it's a bit of fencing.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:39):**  You might have to fence.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:40):**  One way to do it would be, and we do this in the US and places, you put in, let's say  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:46):**  a five acre planting, you fence the whole thing with a metal fencing.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:52):**  And then after the trees are, they say three, four years, the trees are tall enough, they're  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:56):**  out of browsing height of deer or livestock.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:19:59):**  Then you take the fence down and move it somewhere else and use it to establish another five  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:04):**  acres.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:05):**  So in other words, you can recycle that fence around the landscape, that material, if you're  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:10):**  using metal fencing.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:13):**  So any, let's see here.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:14):**  And then you can also maybe in some cases use repellents.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:17):**  There are certain things that will repel a browsing animals.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:20):**  Blood meals are common, commonly known one.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:24):**  We have things called tree tubes here.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:27):**  And I remember when they invented tree tubes, when they first came on the market, some of  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:32):**  the manufacturers knew I was into tree planting.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:34):**  So they sent me free samples.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:36):**  And now we have tree tubes, millions and billions probably planted, made every year, manufactured  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:42):**  every year in the country.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:46):**  And those are generally one to two to three feet tall.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:50):**  And once you plant your tree, you just put the tree tube around it.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:53):**  They're usually only oh, four inches or so in diameter.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:20:57):**  Another interesting thing I would for arid regions, there's a something called the Oasis  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:05):**  grow box, GRO box, I think is the name of it.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:09):**  It's developed in the Netherlands and it's for planting trees and really arid areas.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:15):**  It's a plastic thing and you plant the, it goes around the tree sapling that you planted  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:21):**  the seedling and the, it condenses water from the air and captures all the runoff from any  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:28):**  rain and filter and puts it right at the base of the tree.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:32):**  So it's a way of augmenting the, you might say, irrigating the tree without actually  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:37):**  taking the water to the tree.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:39):**  It gets the water from the natural surroundings and they, according to their literature and  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:45):**  their YouTube, they look like a very successful system of planting trees.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:51):**  They're not, of course, these things are not designed to keep animals off.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:21:56):**  So you'd still need to do the fencing part, but that Oasis grow box looks like a really  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:02):**  good, a really good tool for certain situations.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:06):**  Okay.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:07):**  Now we're really making progress.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:08):**  We've got a plan, we've selected our tree species and we're armed with a bunch of ways  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:12):**  to ensure that these trees survive the vulnerable period.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:16):**  But I know from some experience that what holds a lot of planting projects back is their  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:21):**  lack of funding.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:23):**  Can you tell us about some ways to reduce the cost of tree planting?  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:26):**  In most cases, you're going to have to go out and collect seed.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:30):**  And so if you can collect the seed from the trees that you want that are growing locally,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:37):**  some of these trees are not going to be available in the trade.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:39):**  Some are, or maybe you can't afford them.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:42):**  So that's the, that's usually the quickest way, but you can also do some things.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:46):**  Some trees grow with cuttings.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:48):**  I mentioned cuttings already.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:50):**  So sometimes you can do propagation from cuttings as well.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:22:55):**  And that's a pretty quick way of getting some, getting material.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:00):**  So seeds or cuttings, do it yourself.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:05):**  Do trades.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:06):**  There's a whole system of the botanic gardens and arboretums of the world have a special  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:11):**  exchange offer with each other.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:14):**  You know, an arboretum in Indonesia can trade material with another one in Malaysia or Vietnam  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:23):**  or Brazil or whatever.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:25):**  So they have this whole network.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:27):**  We could really use in the ecosystem restoration movement, a similar type of plant and seed  
**[0:23:33-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:33):**  exchange now so that people can help people get the, the propagation material they need.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:41):**  You mentioned native plants and ecosystem services a minute ago.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:46):**  I plant a lot of non-native plants and some of my plantings, these are more like a production  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:51):**  service, but the, if you're going to be planting native trees, of course, you know, getting  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:23:57):**  the seed as close to the site from native trees to that area.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:01):**  So it's a local genotype.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:04):**  It's locally adapted, a local land race as it were.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:08):**  Those are generally going to be preferred to something that was brought in from 500  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:12):**  or a thousand miles away, you know, from long distances.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:16):**  So local genetics is a really important thing.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:19):**  And it used to be in forestry that they weren't thinking about that, but back around in the  
**[0:24:25-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:25):**  70s, and especially in the 80s, more and more forestry outfit started realizing that the,  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:33):**  that getting local genotypes was better than bringing in long distance ones.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:39):**  So we have to, I want a seed exchange from around the world, but on the other hand, mostly  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:47):**  we should rely on that local, that local genetics.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:51):**  Okay.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:52):**  I am feeling much better equipped to start planting trees now, but I have no doubt that  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:24:57):**  a lot of other questions are going to come up once a project is underway.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:01):**  Where would you recommend that we go for up-to-date information and also where we can exchange  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:05):**  and share information on reforestation?  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:08):**  Well these days with the internet, you can just Google so much information or search  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:15):**  using Ecosia would be a much better way to go, especially in Europe.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:21):**  Though I do use Ecosia here in the US as well.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:24):**  My first search engine I go to.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:27):**  But so I also have a gigantic library of books on reforestation.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:32):**  So I do a lot, I have a huge amount of information at my fingertips in my library.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:39):**  Going to trainings with people that don't know how to do these things, we need farmer  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:45):**  to farmer exchanges.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:48):**  These became really popular in Africa and I believe in the like the 1990s or so where  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:54):**  they would bring a bunch of farmers from Burkina Faso and take them over to Nigeria and they  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:25:59):**  would meet the farmers that were doing and instead of just doing a farmer to farmer visit  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:04):**  like from this county to that county, which is good, they would actually take farmers  
**[0:26:09-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:09):**  from one country to another that similar ecosystems and climate and they would mix, you know,  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:17):**  rub elbows and learn from each other.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:18):**  So people that are doing reforestation should be having little conferences, get together  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:25):**  exchanges where they where they learn from, learn right from the horse's mouth, so to  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:32):**  speak.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:34):**  Start small would be a key thing.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:37):**  And do trial, a lot of trial plantings are really important.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:41):**  So trial planting, start small, do your research.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:45):**  But as Masanobu Fukuoka said, he says, learning and research and studying is really good,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:53):**  he says, but you don't have to.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:55):**  You can just go out there and start doing it.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:57):**  Learn from your mistakes.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:26:59):**  Over time, you will make have a higher and higher percentage of success over time because  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:04):**  you learn from your mistakes, you learn from your successes.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:07):**  So I wouldn't I would say that if people want to get in on this, they could just start doing  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:12):**  it and take their take their lumps, as it were.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:16):**  But if you're going to if you're going to have a hundred thousand dollar budget, you  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:21):**  better do some research instead of just jumping into it without much knowledge.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:26):**  So do your research, start small, but start somewhere, for gosh sakes.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:32):**  If you wait to become an expert, we may lose this window of opportunity right now, according  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:39):**  to an awful lot of ecologists in the world, we have a window of opportunity that's only,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:44):**  you know, depending who you talk to 10, 20, 30 years, not many people give you much more  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:49):**  than that, that we really need to turn the situation around or it's going to get really  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:53):**  dire.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:27:54):**  And there's there's the potential for a huge die off of the world's population is really  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:01):**  staring us in the face.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:03):**  And if we don't get our ax in gear, we are very likely to, you know, to have that come  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:10):**  about.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:11):**  So it's the time is now.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:16):**  And the sooner the better.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:17):**  And there are, of course, a lot of things going on in the world.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:21):**  We need to build on what they are.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:23):**  Oliver, I'm glad to know you should.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:25):**  I imagine you're telling your people and listeners about the the information that you're compiling  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:30):**  on restoration and reforestation for the whole worldwide movement.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:34):**  So you're one of the sources, right?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:38):**  Increasingly, yes.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:39):**  Between the work that I'm doing with ecosystem restoration camps, also the team at Climate  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:43):**  Farmers that I'm working with to build their academy and their farmer community, and of  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:47):**  course, more than four seasons of podcasts all on restoration and regenerative living.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:52):**  I'm truly hoping that listeners have easy and reliable access to information and wisdom  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:28:57):**  required to make major changes in their lives and in their communities.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:04):**  But here's the most important bit.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:06):**  While there are tons of resources on how to build successful projects and really do the  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:11):**  work, it's only worthwhile if you actually get out there and do it.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:16):**  Like Michael said, don't wait to become an expert.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:19):**  Expertise is built as much from experience as it is from knowledge.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:23):**  Go and make mistakes and get better in the process.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:26):**  Whatever your skill set and background, you can apply it to regenerating your portion  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:30):**  of the planet.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:32):**  Don't let the difficulties and disadvantages in your life hold you back from being an example  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:36):**  of the change that you want to see.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-plan-and-succeed-with-your-own-reforestation-project/#t=0:29:43):**  The questions of this week are, what are the major flora of your environment?

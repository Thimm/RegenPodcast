**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:02:49):**  We've been emailing for a little while.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:02:51):**  So how are things going in Massachusetts?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:02:53):**  Things are great.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:02:55):**  It's hard to do a lot lately, which is unprecedented actually as far as records go, breaking all  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:02):**  records for July rainfall, which is good in some ways, good for the plants, also good  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:08):**  for potential diseases and things for fruit trees, which you have to keep an eye on, but  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:12):**  otherwise things are excellent.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:13):**  Nice.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:14):**  Well, look, so you've been explaining over a while to me how you got into the world of  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:19):**  ecological landscaping.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:21):**  It wasn't a direct path.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:22):**  Can you tell me how your interest in all this started?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:25):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:27):**  So I've always been very interested in kind of like the self reliance mindset and just  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:33):**  seemed to make sense.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:34):**  I've listened to a lot of podcasts, a lot of audio books, even as I was going through  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:39):**  university and then especially after I graduated, I still had the itch to just always be learning  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:44):**  continuous education and really trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:49):**  I just invested so much money and time in a traditional conventional university education  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:54):**  in mechanical engineering with a minor in aerospace.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:03:59):**  And my first job out of college, I was working on jet engines and supporting the military  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:03):**  industrial complex and sitting in a cool.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:06):**  And I just realized pretty quickly that that wasn't the route I wanted to take.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:10):**  And I am grateful for that opportunity because it did give me the time to listen to more  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:14):**  audio books and podcasts all day, every day.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:16):**  And I stumbled across the word permaculture in one podcast and it just triggered something  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:23):**  in my brain and my heart.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:24):**  And I knew that that's what I wanted to do.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:25):**  And so then I went all in and learned as much as I could about it.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:29):**  And from that learning journey, what got you into the specialty that you have now?  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:34):**  Because there's so many things you can do with permaculture.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:37):**  And there are some people out there for great reference as to how to do this as a profitable  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:41):**  and ethical landscaping business.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:45):**  Who were some of your mentors and what guided your learning process?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:48):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:51):**  It's true.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:52):**  There are lots of different directions you can go with it.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:04:58):**  But I think that through the educational process, I did find where my skills overlapped with  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:04):**  my interests.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:05):**  And I think from the engineering design perspective, I really lean towards the design aspect and  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:11):**  even in the work that I had done from my career, I really loved the process of developing a  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:16):**  design, conceptualizing it, creating a 3D rendering of a map, and then seeing that come  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:22):**  to fruition.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:23):**  And I was doing it in a machine shop, building machine parts and things.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:26):**  And now being able to do that into a landscape has been really pretty incredible.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:32):**  I'm glad that that common thread throughout my career has stayed true.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:36):**  But as far as inspirations, I mean, Jeff Lawton was number one.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:40):**  I was the first introduction I had to permaculture.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:42):**  So I took his online PDC back in 2015 and was just, again, overwhelmed with the complexity  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:48):**  of it, but also the beauty and the simple, it's simple in philosophy, but very complex  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:55):**  in practice.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:56):**  And that really intrigued me.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:05:58):**  So I did take his PDC in 2015 and then again in 2017.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:03):**  And again, it was online, so I was really looking for something hands-on.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:08):**  And I was still working at the time, really trying to figure out how to actually put this

**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:15):**  And I didn't really want to throw my degree in the trash to the wayside after just accumulating  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:20):**  so much student debt.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:21):**  So I felt beholden to that.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:23):**  So I did stay true on my course there in my career, but always learning.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:28):**  I just really committed to learning as much as I possibly could, knowing that someday  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:32):**  I would get to the point where I was confident enough to make the decision to start my own  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:35):**  business and to go all in.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:38):**  And that point really came after I went through some kind of hard times.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:42):**  I was engaged for like five years.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:46):**  The girl I thought I was going to marry and she ended up walking away, unfortunately,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:49):**  but it really inspired this transaction of events that then occurred where I went to  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:55):**  New Zealand right afterwards.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:06:57):**  I went and lived and worked on the regenerative agriculture farm out there, the Kuanga Institute,  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:02):**  which is just led by beautiful people.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:04):**  And it was just I lived on site there for about four months and was all in.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:10):**  Finally got my hands dirty, saw it in practice, saw how it was an eco village and how that  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:15):**  played into the redesigning of landscapes.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:18):**  And it was really a transformative experience.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:21):**  And so as far as mentors go, I mean, I definitely K Baxter over at the Kuanga Institute and  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:27):**  in Vitor Crispin.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:28):**  He's a cinematographer working on some online courses for them over there.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:32):**  We really connected.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:33):**  And it was humbling and is really humbling and beautiful experience.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:37):**  It's incredible.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:39):**  It sounds like that's been a really valuable influence.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:41):**  I've had a similar story about all the people I've learned from through natural building  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:46):**  and increasingly as I get to travel and have relocated a few times, getting to see other  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:50):**  incredible people in action and their connection to the land has been really inspiring for  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:55):**  me, too.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:07:56):**  And so with that, I would imagine stress of having to still pay for student loan debt.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:04):**  What gave you the confidence to actually throw yourself in and try for a landscaping business  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:10):**  where perhaps you hadn't had any training on before and wasn't sure if this would work  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:16):**  in your community, if there was enough demand for it?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:19):**  So once I completed my internship in New Zealand, I was actually scheduled to stay another month  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:25):**  and go join one of the rugby academy.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:29):**  I do play rugby in the States, which is kind of a rare thing, but I was able to play a  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:35):**  little for the local and COVID happened.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:39):**  And I my trip got cut short by about two months.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:41):**  And, you know, the world, this global pandemic hit hard and it was really unknown at the  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:45):**  time.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:46):**  It was early stages.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:47):**  We had no idea how bad it was going to be.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:48):**  And I was left with the ultimatum of either staying indefinitely or getting on a plane  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:54):**  the next day.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:55):**  And so it was one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:08:58):**  And, you know, nowhere else in the world, I'd rather be stuck in a global pandemic than  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:02):**  on this beautiful regenerative farm in New Zealand.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:06):**  But I decided, you know, to take what I learned in it was the catalyst for me to jump in.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:11):**  And now it's more important than ever for people to learn how to take care of themselves,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:15):**  how to grow their own food, how to create these nutrient dense ways to boost their immune  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:20):**  system and through transforming their own landscapes.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:23):**  And so that was really my my drive was to help inspire more people to take control of  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:28):**  their lives, knowing that those systems that we have are fragile.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:32):**  You know, it was just very clear during the pandemic when grocery store shelves were empty.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:37):**  That's like, you can't rely on these forever.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:39):**  And what more empowering and better way to take control than by planting a garden.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:45):**  And so that was really the the angle I took.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:48):**  And you know, so I did come back committed to start my own edible landscape and company.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:51):**  And I was writing out a business plan, really figuring out how to implement it and doing  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:55):**  a lot of research of other companies that exist in the area of which there are very  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:09:59):**  few.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:00):**  And it just happened to stumble across one just outside of Boston, Massachusetts, where  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:04):**  I'm in central Massachusetts.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:05):**  So about an hour, an hour and a half away, called Home Harvest.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:09):**  And I really just found him and called the owner cold and just reached out and said,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:14):**  hey, I'm starting my own edible landscaping business out of central mass.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:17):**  Just wondering if you had any advice or you want to collaborate.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:20):**  And the owner out there is Ben Barkin, who had been in business since 2008, built this  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:24):**  really incredible brand in beautiful imagery.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:28):**  And he had learned so much through his years building this business and he was interested  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:32):**  in expanding.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:34):**  And so we got to talking and it's not technically a franchise, but worked out a licensing agreement  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:38):**  for me to build off of his success.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:40):**  And he became a great mentor of mine and a huge, valuable resource.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:44):**  And that was really a good springboard and a confidence booster, knowing that I had his  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:49):**  support moving forward and that the financials were there to prove it, as well as the success  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:56):**  and the results and the professionalism worked out really well.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:10:59):**  Oh, that's fantastic.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:01):**  And that's something that I've really noticed in this line of work, because I've worked  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:04):**  in a lot of other industries as well, but people are really open and willing to help  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:08):**  you out.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:09):**  And, you know, it's even turned into a collaboration for you.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:11):**  And it's something that is always, I guess, not surprising anymore because I've seen it  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:17):**  often enough, but still kind of reassuring that this is something that attracts really  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:23):**  good people, that brings the best out in people as well.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:28):**  And that there is this general, we're in this together sentiment that has made this so like  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:35):**  it's very welcoming.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:36):**  It's very inviting.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:37):**  Okay.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:38):**  So with the assistance of a preexisting business model that you could adapt to your area, what  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:46):**  were some of the things that were successful in getting your first client?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:50):**  Honestly, what I have found to be the easiest part of this business has been just exuding  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:11:57):**  my passion of what I do and talking with people that might not know it's like the balance  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:05):**  of this being such a niche business that not many people even know that it's an offering  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:10):**  that they can look for.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:11):**  But being able to go to somebody's home and see their landscape, and they may have just  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:18):**  called me to plant a foundation garden.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:21):**  And then while I'm there, I'm able to say, hey, have you considered, you know, this large  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:25):**  open grass space in the back that looks like it's not being used?  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:28):**  We could plant three or four apple trees, a row of blueberries, and maybe a native pollinator  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:32):**  garden.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:33):**  And just you can see their eyes widened, like, wow, I never even considered anything but  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:39):**  grass.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:40):**  And so having that portfolio of experience and pictures to be able to show people like,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:44):**  this is what this grass lawn could be, and where we're just stacking as many functions  
**[0:12:49-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:49):**  as we can into the landscape, from an ecological perspective, providing wildlife habitat, pollinator,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:12:58):**  as well as human impact and the physical health of growing your own nutritious food and the

**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:13):**  need that we've lost over the last couple of decades.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:16):**  And I think that people really relate to that.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:18):**  And so, yeah, I think really the passion of what I have, and now that I'm developing more  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:24):**  fluency in a lot of the terms and just really being able to relate to people and find out  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:30):**  what it is that they're looking for, whether it's more from a self-reliance perspective,  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:34):**  or just a beauty and finding that perfect blend of aesthetic and function and appealing  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:39):**  to their needs.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:40):**  Yeah, that's really in line with what I've seen as well.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:43):**  People who are new to this are very easy to inspire when you give them the options that  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:48):**  are available that perhaps they'd never considered.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:51):**  And though lawns are not quite as prolific here in Spain as they are in the United States,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:13:56):**  just because it's dry and it's not normally what people grew in their backyard, but still  
**[0:14:01-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:01):**  a lot of gardens, it's interesting to see how different cultural norms dictate what  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:09):**  is possible and what people consider as their options when they're looking to do something  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:13):**  with their space.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:15):**  And so I'm curious in working with a lot of people who are probably new to this and many  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:19):**  of the concepts, what are some of the challenges that you have with communicating these ideas  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:23):**  and explaining to them how it works?  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:26):**  Because in the past, I've worked with clients as well, who they kind of get the concepts  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:32):**  and they really connect with the idea of what's possible.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:36):**  But you need somebody who's going to maintain it as well and being able to maintain a complex  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:41):**  system, especially with someone who's only used to riding a mower around to cut the grass  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:45):**  and doesn't necessarily know how to take care of a more complex ecosystem.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:51):**  Where is the difficulty in that communication for newbies?  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:54):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:56):**  That's something I have found, especially in the permaculture realm where it's pretty  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:14:59):**  romantic.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:00):**  A lot of people think we can develop these systems that just take care of themselves,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:03):**  but the reality is maintenance is involved for sure.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:06):**  And so with clients, I either really want to educate them.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:10):**  I am working on some different guides and just one pagers of how to maintain your fruit  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:15):**  trees.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:16):**  As well as in the future, I would love to create some more online courses and some content  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:22):**  that I can either use as a free resource for clients to help inspire and teach them how  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:26):**  to maintain their own landscapes or schedule recurring maintenance visits that I can do  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:31):**  and also encourage the client to come and be one-on-one firsthand how I maintain them  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:38):**  so that I can then teach them and pass that on.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:40):**  Because that's really what this is all about.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:42):**  It's really teaching people how to do it themselves.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:44):**  And it's interesting, again, in the permaculture realm, there's a lot of good intentions and  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:51):**  good philosophical ideas, but then when you start blending the capitalistic mindset into  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:15:56):**  it and the cultural norms of Americans, these independent, relatively arrogant and selfish  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:02):**  people who love their grass lawns, you try to pull a man away from his lawnmower.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:09):**  There's a lot of emotional tension there for some odd reason.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:15):**  But trying to, yeah, I think, again, inspire and then educate is really the most important  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:19):**  thing and hopefully inspire them enough to take the education into their own hands.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:25):**  And they may not have ever heard that word permaculture.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:28):**  And so I'm really looking to find those clients who hear that word, hear the concept, and  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:33):**  something clicks just like it did for me and so many others who get into this space where  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:37):**  all of a sudden you're like, you just never even considered this entire other world of  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:42):**  opportunity of where you work with rather than against nature.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:45):**  Instead of soaking your lawn with chemicals, that you can work with it and find these beautiful  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:50):**  symbiotic relationships and stepping back and observing.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:54):**  And there's so much opportunity to do better.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:16:57):**  And I think that a lot of clients do align with that once they understand the process.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:02):**  For sure, for sure.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:04):**  And I would imagine there's a ton of potential in there with all those things you were talking  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:07):**  about for adding value to the service, maybe having some online courses or offering training  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:13):**  sessions or some sort of recurring maintenance.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:17):**  That's a really good way to advertise or promote the business in a very authentic way.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:23):**  And you're connecting with people who are interested in these topics while adding on  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:27):**  value to the service that you're already offering in landscape design while getting a message  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:33):**  out there for other people who would resonate with it.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:35):**  And so what would you say are the typical profile of people that you work with?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:42):**  Is there quite a pattern?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:43):**  Is it a similar demographic of folks or is it kind of all over the place?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:49):**  Yeah, it's been pretty hard to nail down a target demographic because it does break.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:17:56):**  And working with the original Home Harvest founder out in Boston has quite a different  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:02):**  demographic than I do out here in central Massachusetts, where he's appealing to a wealthier  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:06):**  demographic with smaller spaces, really just corner suburban lots that are pretty densely  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:12):**  packed.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:13):**  Whereas I have a lot more land, a lot more space, people have more room to work with,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:19):**  but also less of an income or less of a budget.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:23):**  And so it's been interesting to see a balance of a lot of younger generations, a lot of  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:29):**  millennials who are first time homeowners who right away first thing say, I don't want  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:33):**  a lawn, I want this ecological landscape.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:36):**  And that's an awesome demographic for me.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:39):**  And then there's also the older, typically women, maybe stay at home mothers who are  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:46):**  interested in providing more of an opportunity for their children.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:49):**  And that's been a very intriguing demographic to work with as well, because they may not  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:18:56):**  have as much knowledge or like, no, but they just know that they want some grass base for  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:01):**  the children to play, but have this idea of a lot of the imagery that we work with.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:06):**  And we have some great photos of children eating fruit, picking blueberries and eating  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:10):**  them.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:11):**  And again, that's like a fundamental human thing.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:13):**  Like I think that it's a really important skill and really important experience for  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:17):**  children to know what is healthy food and where it comes from.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:22):**  And a lot of parents do align with that.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:24):**  And so I've found that wealthier demographics with children in a lot of space are totally  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:28):**  open to it as well as younger generations, which is a little bit harder now because a  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:31):**  lot of them aren't buying houses.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:33):**  The housing market is incredibly competitive here right now and things are, you know, values  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:40):**  are through the roof, but then there's the other subset of people who are starting out  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:45):**  their homesteads.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:46):**  And that's a little bit outside of the city where I am, but that's an ideal demographic  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:50):**  for me as well is a young couple who have this dream.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:53):**  You know, they watched The Big Little Farm on Netflix and really were connected with  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:19:59):**  that message.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:00):**  And they say, we're doing it, we're starting our own homestead.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:02):**  And so I do offer services as well as more of a, as like a long-term homestead design  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:07):**  consultant and really help them get established in that sense, which is good from a business  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:12):**  perspective because it is a long-term mutual relationship.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:15):**  So yeah, it's kind of the blend, but it is hard to nail down.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:20):**  So within that range, it sounds like there's quite a range of services that you offer as  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:24):**  well from sort of wild native landscapes to more curated ones.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:30):**  I would imagine vegetable gardens and edible fruit trees and things like that all the way  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:35):**  to actual production leaning on the homestead side, you kind of do everything in between  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:40):**  there.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:41):**  I do.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:43):**  And still learning a lot as I go, you know, it's a very humbling sphere to be in because  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:46):**  it's never ending.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:47):**  Like there's so much to learn.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:49):**  There's so much more new research coming out that shows different best practices.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:54):**  And yeah, so I, you know, my typical demographic right now is suburban backyards.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:20:59):**  And through that is more informal.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:02):**  I like densely planted cottage gardens with a lot of native flowers, as well as some edible  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:07):**  functions as well.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:09):**  And with the homestead design, yeah, and orchards, like it's one thing that I love more than  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:15):**  anything is to learn.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:18):**  Do project or some interest from a client.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:21):**  That's something that I haven't had much experience with.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:23):**  Then I'll go all in and I'll read as much as I possibly can about it and, and use that  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:28):**  knowledge to help design it, work with the client to achieve whatever goal it is.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:33):**  Typically it's not necessarily full orchard scale for market gardening or production.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:43):**  But I have, I mean, I've, I've had planted fruit trees in somebody's backyard, 25 chestnuts,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:49):**  again that long-term legacy planting chestnuts that are six to 12 inches tall, little seedlings  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:21:54):**  that are going to potentially live 300 plus years and produce thousands of pounds of,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:00):**  of staple crop for their great, great grandchildren.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:04):**  And they're planting that tree with the intention of leaving a legacy.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:07):**  And I love that.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:09):**  And that's something I do encourage for a lot of people as well.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:13):**  That's so cool.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:14):**  And it really works with what I've noticed as well is that people can come here from  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:17):**  so many different motivations and find something that fits within what is going to achieve  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:23):**  their personal goals while also improving the health and the resilience of their ecosystem  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:28):**  at the same time.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:29):**  And there's a lot of this overlap in interests and motivations that I think brings everybody  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:36):**  to the table in a way a lot of other vocations or focuses don't and connect with people's  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:44):**  inherent desire for connection to the places that they live in and to be able to interact  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:51):**  with it in a way that is beneficial to it while also creating a yield for themselves  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:55):**  and other benefits for the community.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:22:57):**  And so within this range of services that you offer and focuses that you have, what  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:04):**  has been something that you have learned recently that has really changed the way that you see  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:08):**  your work or has offered you a new option or tool to work with?  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:12):**  Yeah, there's tons of opportunity out here for working with water on a small scale.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:18):**  So I've been just last week, we installed a garden, but this is very hilly and there's  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:25):**  a lot of erosion problems, lots of excess stormwater runoff, and where you can have  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:30):**  three or four properties all almost terraced down a relatively steep hill where the water  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:37):**  from the neighbor up top, it all cascades down and then I'll get a call saying that  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:42):**  there's this erosion problem through somebody's yard and it's the uphill neighbors that there's  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:47):**  no form of accountability for.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:50):**  And that's been a challenge of figuring out the best way to handle water.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:54):**  And of course, an incredibly important aspect of permaculture design and this ecological  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:23:59):**  design.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:00):**  So that is something that was cool to see just last week.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:03):**  We planted this rain garden and where the curb was cut on the street such that all the  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:09):**  runoff from the street came right through this woman's property.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:12):**  Her property was actually already a certified wildlife habitat.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:16):**  She was a professor of environmental science and so she's very in tune with a lot of these  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:20):**  concepts.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:21):**  And so it's really cool to see, we were out there in the rain one day, I was seeing the  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:27):**  water come and how impactful just a one foot deep trench can have on directing and managing  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:35):**  water flow.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:36):**  And so we were able to dig the trench, put a swale in such that all the water from this  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:39):**  one space collected and then we built up a berm and it slowly soaked it.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:44):**  And it was just like one day of work, we completely transformed this erosion problem and how much  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:49):**  of an impact and now planting that whole garden densely so that all the plants then absorb  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:55):**  that water and filter it.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:24:57):**  And it was just pretty amazing to see how little work it took to make a massive impact  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:03):**  when managing water.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:04):**  And I think there's lots and lots of opportunity for that.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:07):**  Yeah, that's really cool.

**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:13):**  problem.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:14):**  In the rain, we kind of have the opposite problem and are dealing with drought issues.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:17):**  But I definitely remember from Guatemala when we'd be in the rainy seasons there, both on  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:22):**  the large slopes that we had by living in the mountains and just the sheer volume of  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:26):**  water that comes down in some of those storms.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:29):**  It's not talked about nearly as much as the water shortage issue, but it can do a whole  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:34):**  lot of damage.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:35):**  And we're even seeing massive flooding in Western Germany and all sorts of other places  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:41):**  here in the north in Europe recently as well.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:44):**  And yeah, water is such an important factor to manage from the beginning because it is  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:49):**  often the limiting factor for so many other things that you do at lower levels of the  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:54):**  scale of permanence.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:25:55):**  Now aside from these new learning experiences, what do you find that are some of the key  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:03):**  design sciences or techniques that you keep coming back to regularly that help to keep  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:08):**  your designs grounded and inform some consistency in the results that you get?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:14):**  Yeah, I think that there's a lot of lessons that I have been learning this year specifically  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:18):**  that continue to build onto each other and things that I'm able to then apply for every  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:23):**  new job moving forward.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:24):**  One thing that I did have a bit of a hard time with just getting started was the design  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:30):**  science of landscape design with just general ornamental plantings.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:34):**  And so from an aesthetic perspective and ornamental garden design, that was a pretty big learning  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:40):**  curve where I felt really confident in my permaculture skills and edibles and gardening,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:45):**  but then incorporating the aesthetic aspect and making sure, which I think is an incredibly  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:49):**  valuable part of this whole process is making sure whatever we do, it has to be beautiful.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:56):**  It has to be aesthetic in order for it to catch on.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:26:59):**  And so Ben does a really great job of that.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:01):**  And he did teach me a lot as far as what plants to use and incorporating natives in these  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:07):**  flowering shrubs incorporated with the edibles so that they all work together in this beautiful  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:13):**  harmony.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:15):**  But as far as the actual design process too, I mean, I, again, my background is in computer  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:21):**  aided design.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:22):**  And so I love using software to visualize the landscape, you know, import the satellite  
**[0:27:27-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:27):**  imagery and I'm able to build the design and take my time with it too, and play with different  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:34):**  iterations and move things around and doing that in a digital way that's easy to manipulate  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:39):**  is really helpful just for my own process of figuring out, okay, how am I actually going  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:45):**  to install this and what are the benefits and why would I laying it out this way?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:50):**  And I like the iterative process of coming up with a few different ideas and then picking  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:54):**  the one that I think makes the most sense.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:27:56):**  And a lot of times it becomes very clear after a few iterations, like, okay, this makes way  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:02):**  more sense in this configuration.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:05):**  But yeah, I do love the software to be able to move things around and all of the technology  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:09):**  that we have today is really helpful to be able to understand sun patterns and especially  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:14):**  even plant identification apps, I think are pretty incredible now they've gotten a lot  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:19):**  more accurate.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:20):**  And that's something that we've never had in the history of humankind, the ability to  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:24):**  point our device and have the entire wealth deal to identify plants on the spot.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:29):**  And that's always been a passed on thing through generations, through elder teachings and,  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:34):**  or field manuals, both of which are just very much more difficult to come by.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:38):**  So using that as a learning process as a tool to better understand the landscapes as they  
**[0:28:44-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:44):**  currently exist and in new design features, of course, working with the client and figuring  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:52):**  out a lot of times it's easier when the client is able to say, this is what I want.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:56):**  But more often than not people say, well, what do you think?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:28:59):**  You know, they're open to a lot more of an idea, which makes it a little bit harder to  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:03):**  come up with a design because it's, it is a clean slate.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:07):**  But yeah, I really love the iterative aspect of the designs and creating 3d renderings  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:12):**  through the software that I use is really a great sales tool and just a visual learning  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:18):**  opportunity for myself as well to see the sizes of plants and through that software,  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:23):**  like you said, making things replicable where the sizes of the plants are incorporated into  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:28):**  the software so I can drop them.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:31):**  And that's one thing on planting design is understanding the height gradation, always  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:36):**  making sure the tallest things are in back and the spacing between plants is so important.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:42):**  And it is hard to, it takes time to familiarize yourself with the plants well enough to know  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:47):**  that.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:48):**  But that's a continuous learning opportunity to understand spacings and arrangements of  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:54):**  plants and the software does help with that.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:29:57):**  What would you say is the technology that you rely on most often in your work and maybe  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:02):**  some recommendations for things that are really worth investing in if you plan on going into  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:06):**  this line of work?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:07):**  Yeah, I mean, there's lots of free software, lots of free tools and which is really incredible.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:12):**  I mean, Google Earth is number one, use Google Earth every single day, being able to import  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:17):**  scaled landscape plans of existing properties using tax maps.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:21):**  Most of here in the United States, most of the county records are available for free  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:26):**  online so you can look up the property address and see the exact boundaries of the property,  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:32):**  which is really important to work from that as well as the visual imagery.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:38):**  And usually Google Earth is great.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:40):**  We have here in Massachusetts an orthographic LIDAR program that ran back in 2019 and it  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:50):**  was actually a plane that flew overhead in such a way that it's actually much more clear  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:55):**  a lot of times to see where there's not so much foliage.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:30:59):**  So that's a big thing with Google Earth.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:01):**  A lot of times the tree cover can totally hide what you're trying to see from the satellite  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:08):**  imagery and so see if your county or your region has different tools that they have  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:13):**  done through drone footage or an actual plane where they have this imagery that's really,  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:19):**  really valuable, especially through COVID where it was a bit more remote, didn't have  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:24):**  the opportunity to spend as much time on site with a client.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:27):**  So being able to have that satellite imagery is really important and a lot of times the  
**[0:31:31-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:31):**  contours are also there, so dealing with steeper or different contoured sites, getting that  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:41):**  data is super valuable.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:45):**  And then, yeah, there's a lot of free software.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:47):**  I happen to use Realtime Landscaping Architect is a software.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:51):**  It's relatively affordable.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:53):**  But yeah, between the Plant Identification app, iNaturalist works really well or PlantNet,  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:31:59):**  that's super valuable in all the satellite imagery.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:02):**  And you can do it all by hand and that's one thing.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:03):**  You learn the permaculture courses usually is how to do all these things just by hand  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:08):**  and measuring out sites.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:09):**  But I don't even really need to measure much anymore because I know that I have a two-scale  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:14):**  satellite or orthographic image that I can work from and that just speeds up the process,  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:20):**  which is good because it can take a very long time to get a good design together.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:25):**  So finding the efficiencies in that without sacrificing quality.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:29):**  Let's shift focus for a second and talk more about the business side of this because I  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:35):**  know a lot of people who are very capable and knowledgeable ecologists or study permaculture  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:41):**  design or regenerative agriculture, whatever it might be, but struggled to nail it on the  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:46):**  business side.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:47):**  And those are very different skill sets.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:51):**  Did you come with more of a strength and experience in the business side or from the permaculture  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:56):**  and design side?  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:32:58):**  I think it was actually a pretty good balance.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:00):**  So I did have some experience.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:01):**  I've started a couple of businesses in the past.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:04):**  I got into real estate investing and got my general contractor's license and I was doing  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:08):**  that part-time while still working as an engineer.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:11):**  And so work ethic is really important in any self-owned enterprise and it is really important  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:18):**  where I was working part-time and renovating houses and learning how to renovate houses  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:23):**  in the meantime, knowing that by owning a few passive income properties that would help  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:29):**  buffer my income level so that when I did jump into the permaculture design business  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:34):**  that I didn't have to really rely on that to pay my bills and pay my student loans.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:41):**  So that was really worthwhile experience.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:43):**  And I did, again, through just podcasts and audio books, I learned everything I could  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:48):**  about real estate investing.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:50):**  And that was a really valuable opportunity because it came with a lot of business building  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:55):**  aspects to that as well.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:33:56):**  And being able to build it up in such a way as a general contractor where I was able to  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:00):**  flip these houses, but not actually spend much time on site at all.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:03):**  The first few I did all myself, my partner and I, we worked together and learned the  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:07):**  skills.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:08):**  But then as soon as I could really step back and hired out people who were experts and  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:12):**  just built it into the process where as soon as we get the house, we hire all the subcontractors  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:18):**  we need and they perform the work.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:20):**  And so I've taken that into this business as well, acting as kind of the all things  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:25):**  exterior general contractor and trying to build partnerships with other industries such  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:31):**  as Mason.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:32):**  I have a great Mason that I work with finding an arborist, finding somebody who might install  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:37):**  ponds or an excavator and having these strategic partnerships with other people where I can  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:44):**  confidently tell a customer like, yes, we can take care of that.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:47):**  And then I have a partner that I trust and it does take time to build those relationships,  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:52):**  but once you have them, they can be incredibly valuable.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:55):**  And they're just part of the team.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:34:58):**  So I did have some experience with building businesses and the book, The E-Myth was really  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:04):**  valuable for me.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:05):**  There is a book, The E-Myth for Landscaping Contractors which is super valuable.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:10):**  And it really just talks about how to scale and grow a business which may or may not be  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:16):**  the right path for some people.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:18):**  A lot of people, I mean, I could just do it myself with my pickup truck and a shovel and  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:23):**  just go and just do all the work myself, do all the sales and all the marketing myself  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:28):**  and just slow it down and just kind of pick away at it over time.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:32):**  But I really want to have the most impact I can and really spread this message.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:35):**  And there's a lot of opportunity for it.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:37):**  And so I would rather then look to see, okay, I know that my highest value role in my business  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:44):**  is sales and consultations and design.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:48):**  And so figuring out how I can set up my crews and hire people so that they can run the jobs  
**[0:35:54-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:35:54):**  and I can encourage and empower them to run the jobs on their own with minimal guidance  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:01):**  so that then they're on the job working like I have now.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:05):**  And then I can be doing more sales and face-to-face meetings with customers and figuring out ways  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:11):**  to better market the business.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:14):**  So that's been a pretty big struggle with the business building process where I'm just  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:17):**  digging holes all day and planting trees.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:20):**  And then I get home at 7 p.m. and I have 30 missed emails and a bunch of people I have  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:24):**  to follow up on.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:25):**  And I had to wake up at 5 a.m. to work on a design.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:28):**  And it's just, it can be all consuming.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:31):**  So it is important to set boundaries and make sure you give yourself time to relax as well.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:36):**  But yeah, just one thing at a time and you're always learning and trying to find ways to  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:40):**  make it more efficient and effective.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:42):**  Oh, man, I definitely hear you.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:44):**  That was an unexpected turn for me too when I was doing contracting for natural buildings,  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:49):**  especially towards the end there in Guatemala, where I figured I got into this so that I  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:53):**  could be on construction sites and actually be doing some work because it was what I really  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:57):**  enjoyed.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:36:58):**  But as you get to a level where you're running and doing the designs, managing sites, you  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:05):**  end up taking on a very different role.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:07):**  I was behind the computer much more often than I had intended to be and was taking on  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:12):**  kind of a, yeah, I guess just a different role.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:15):**  And it changed the expectations that I had about perhaps making it a career because I  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:20):**  wanted to be more of a worker and an artisan than a manager or a business person.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:26):**  And so it was part of the reason why I got into different contracting and lines of work.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:31):**  But I hear you, depending on what you train for and the responsibilities that you take  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:37):**  on, just because it's a permaculture type of a business doesn't mean that your tasks  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:42):**  and your responsibilities are going to be directly related to those things.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:47):**  And you were saying too that there's a lot of opportunity in this space.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:51):**  Can you talk about that opportunity and do you think that this is a reasonable business  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:55):**  venture for somebody to take on?  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:57):**  Yes.  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:58):**  Yes.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:37:59):**  We need more people, please, in this sphere.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:02):**  It is so important.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:05):**  The field, it is the most valuable work we can be doing as human beings is figuring out  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:09):**  and teaching people how to work with nature in more cohesive ways.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:13):**  And there's so much competition within the landscaping sphere itself.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:17):**  There are probably 30 to 50 landscaping companies just in my city alone.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:23):**  And they're all just cutting grass and trimming shrubs.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:26):**  And it wouldn't be that difficult to get some education and to transform some of those existing  
**[0:38:31-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:31):**  landscaping companies into more ecological companies.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:34):**  And we're riding this wave right now of this green awakening where people are realizing  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:40):**  that they don't want just expansive grass lawns anymore and they want to have more of  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:44):**  an impact.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:45):**  And we can do that in our own backyards.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:48):**  And it's been great to see the clients that I work with, some of them just say, I've been  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:52):**  looking for somebody who does organic land care for the last five years.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:38:58):**  And the only ones that exist are two to three hours away.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:02):**  And so there are some cities where there are a few, but where I am, there's a two hour  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:07):**  radius where there's not a single other company doing what I do and advertising ecological  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:12):**  design, organic land care, or permaculture design.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:15):**  And there's just, there's so much opportunity in that sphere.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:18):**  And it's so rewarding.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:19):**  You know, it's a balance of being so niche that it's hard to get clients because there  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:26):**  aren't all that many people actively looking for it, but also the ones who are looking  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:30):**  for it are going to be your biggest fans.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:33):**  And that's been really cool to see and very encouraging the few clients that we have who  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:37):**  then word of mouth is such a big part of this business too.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:41):**  And as they share it with their neighbors and putting a sign out front to show that  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:47):**  this is what this yard could become.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:50):**  And when they're side by side like that, it really sells itself.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:54):**  But yeah, I think that as far as startup costs, there's not many other businesses you can  
**[0:39:59-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:39:59):**  get started with a pickup and a shovel, or even a bicycle and a wheelbarrow and a shovel.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:07):**  Like you can get started without all that much.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:11):**  And the growth opportunity from there is almost endless.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:16):**  There are many companies doing this, but there's not that level pressure from other competition.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:24):**  And there's tons of room for collaboration with other industries, as I was saying, being  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:28):**  able to partner up with other companies who are working with landscape, whether they're  
**[0:40:32-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:32):**  arborists or a lot of the mains do hardscaping jobs that are, there's a lot of overlap that  
**[0:40:43-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:43):**  you can incorporate some water management or some garden design.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:50):**  The ability to teach as many people as you can, what you do and why you do it and what  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:54):**  it looks like, then the more opportunity that snowballs from that.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:40:58):**  So I highly encourage anybody who's interested in starting, just getting started.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:02):**  And that's one thing too, there's a lot of different directions to go where I'm honestly  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:07):**  doing a few businesses in one, like a lot of people might just have their design business  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:11):**  and you could just do designs and that's your full-time or part-time gig.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:16):**  And you can do that through satellite imagery and just meeting with clients and then finding  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:19):**  landscaping companies to do the installs.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:22):**  Or you could do the installs as, or do both as I'm doing, you can find gardeners.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:28):**  There are quite a few or just regular gardeners who do designs, but don't have anybody to  
**[0:41:35-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:35):**  do the actual installs.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:36):**  And that would be a good way to learn the business and learn about garden design.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:41):**  So by working with somebody who's an expert and then seeing their plant and installing  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:44):**  it is kind of a good stepping stone.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:48):**  And then even nursery design and having a tree nursery, there's a lot of rare fruit  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:54):**  trees and things that I had to have my own fruit tree nursery, which has been invaluable,  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:41:57):**  but it's also another business entirely in itself.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:01):**  So it does get a bit overwhelming, but that's not open for retail or anything, but it's  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:06):**  really just a way for me to provide pawpaw and persimmon and elderberry and currants and  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:11):**  a lot of these fruiting trees and shrubs that you cannot get at typical nurseries.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:15):**  And it's a lot of opportunity there from a business perspective to get rootstock and  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:22):**  graft your own trees and get cuttings and start from seed in such a way that it's a  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:26):**  long-term investment, but not many products gain value the longer they sit on the shelves.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:31):**  And so that is, as long as you keep them alive, being able to supply, there's a big shortage  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:37):**  of supply of these unique and rare plant materials.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:40):**  So yeah, there's a lot of opportunity and you can definitely make a good money doing  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:47):**  it.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:48):**  And I think that people are willing to pay for it when they know that it's a great value.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:51):**  And so that's what it's all about, providing value.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:56):**  For sure, yeah, there really is a ton of different ways that you can either do this directly  
**[0:42:59-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:42:59):**  or support the actual business of landscaping or ecosystem restoration as some sort of adjacent  
**[0:43:06-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:43:06):**  business.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:43:07):**  We've been identifying a lot of this as far as supporting regenerative agriculture too.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:43:11):**  There are a ton of support businesses that can move that movement forward without having  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:43:17):**  to necessarily be a farmer yourself.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:43:19):**  All right, so where can people go to learn more about you and your work, Nathan?  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nathan-fournier-on-the-business-side-of-regenerative-landscaping-and-community-restoration/#t=0:43:24):**  Yeah, my website is homeharvestcentralma.com.

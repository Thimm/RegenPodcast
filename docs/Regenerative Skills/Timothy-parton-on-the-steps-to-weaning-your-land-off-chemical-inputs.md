**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:00:18):**  is at a critical moment right now. We find ourselves between simultaneous crises in which  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:00:23):**  the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to shine a light on the instability of our  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:00:28):**  global food system, all while the war in Ukraine is resulting in a shortage of grain and synthetic  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:00:34):**  fertilizers. The full effects of these scenarios are still a long way away from being felt,  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:00:40):**  but I can tell you that the dramatic rise in the cost of these commodities is already  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:00:43):**  throwing many farm operations into a panic. Many growers are now faced with excruciating

**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:01:03):**  their land management models and make a dramatic shift to a low or zero fertilizer farming  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:01:08):**  method that their ecosystem may or may not be prepared for.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:01:13):**  At the center of all of these are annual crop producers, mostly the growers of wheat, corn,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:01:17):**  soy, and other cereal and legume crops that make up the majority of the cultivated land

**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:08):**  website to accelerate your transition to regenerative management right away.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:12):**  And with that said, I will hand things over now to Timothy Parton.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:17):**  Now Tim, I know that this transition didn't happen overnight, so can you start by telling  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:22):**  us how you began to manage your farm regeneratively in the beginning, and what was the mindset  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:28):**  shift that really made these concepts click for you?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:31):**  Yeah, evening everybody.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:34):**  I think probably I've always had an interest in soil.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:37):**  I could never understand even as a young boy why we abused our soil so much.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:42):**  So my journey started really with wanting to improve my soil.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:46):**  I could see our soils were going backwards.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:50):**  And with that soil, we can't farm anything.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:53):**  Soil gives us everything.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:54):**  It gives us air, it gives us clean water, and it gives us food.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:57):**  And it's the most valuable resource a farmer can have.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:05:59):**  And I think that was the real moment I wanted to improve the soil, and that was always my  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:06):**  goal.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:07):**  Rather than financial gain, I knew if I got the soil right, the financial gains would  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:11):**  fall.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:12):**  So I first probably started to make the transition moving from a mid-till system into a strip-till  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:17):**  system, which at the time I thought was fantastic.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:21):**  And the strip-till system really gave my brain a chance to start and accept moving less soil.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:27):**  And as I went down and got more into biology, I realized the strip-till was still moving  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:33):**  too much soil for me.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:34):**  And that's where I moved to no-till.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:37):**  And I really started to get into biology then and brewing biology up.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:41):**  And biology's got all the answers, in my opinion.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:45):**  And we've spent all last century just ignoring biology.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:48):**  And I firmly believe this century is the century we'll be working with biology and working  
**[0:06:53-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:06:53):**  with nature and getting the best out of nature for ourselves and the whole planet, basically.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:01):**  And through this key insight, it's one thing to come to a realization that the biology  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:06):**  is the key and that focusing on soil health is really what makes everything work.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:11):**  But how is that different from the way that you were used to managing things?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:16):**  And what helped you in the transition towards focusing on biological health?  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:21):**  I think I'll probably answer the second part of that question first.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:27):**  I first sort of, when I realized that we could fix nitrogen from the air, I read Charles  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:33):**  Walters book, I can't remember the title of it.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:37):**  Once I realized that the air is 78% air, it's free.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:41):**  And I think it was back in 2012, the first year I started to play about with biology  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:47):**  and I wasn't brewing then, I was just putting the microbes on.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:52):**  And I reduced nitrogen applications by 40 kilos per hectare to pay for the biology.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:07:57):**  And everywhere I used it, I got an extra ton to the hectare in yield, which to me was like,  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:03):**  wow, what are we going to do now?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:06):**  And the following year I didn't get the yield increase, I got the same yield because biology  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:10):**  is a fickle thing and it's understanding it.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:14):**  Our climate is so temperamental that things don't always fit.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:19):**  That's just life as a farmer anyway, in my mind.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:22):**  I think that's part of the challenge.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:23):**  That's what we all enjoy, is that challenge of trying to fight the weather all the while  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:28):**  and coming out on top more often than not.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:30):**  You just repeat the first bit of that question, Oliver.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:35):**  Sorry, I've forgotten already.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:36):**  Yeah, no problem.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:37):**  So as you understand that the key is in the health of the biology and the soil, it's one  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:43):**  thing to understand that and it's another to actually apply it on your own land.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:49):**  So once applying it...  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:51):**  From that moment of realizing I could fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, that was the  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:08:59):**  light bulb moment for me with biology because then I started reading more and more books  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:03):**  on biology.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:04):**  I wanted to know more.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:05):**  I don't think I'll ever know everything on the type of guy that once I start to get interested,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:10):**  I want to know everything I can about it.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:12):**  I think this one will beat me because I don't think I'll ever get there because we're constantly  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:16):**  evolving.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:17):**  So once I made that light bulb moment, I then adapted the drill so as I could brew biology  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:23):**  and place it right next to the seed in that seed trench.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:27):**  So as I was planting the seed, I'm dropping the biology right next to the seed so we can  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:32):**  start to get that symbiosis going on between the biology and really start to get that rhizosphere  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:36):**  working again because in my mind, we've spent the last 70 years killing everything.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:41):**  And so this was just trying to introduce and bring things back and have that harmony within  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:47):**  the soil of everything working again.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:49):**  Okay, so Tim, so as you started to implement these changes, you also mentioned that the  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:09:56):**  second year you didn't see the increases or the improvements that you had seen the first  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:00):**  year and that biology is a bit of a fickle thing.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:02):**  I know that with my own experience in consultations and perhaps with yours as well, managing expectations  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:09):**  in the transition period is really important.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:11):**  What would you say to growers who are facing perhaps a pretty drastic transition from very  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:16):**  machine and chemical intensive management towards favoring the biology and the health  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:21):**  of the soil?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:22):**  What should they expect and what kind of timelines are realistic to really start to see changes  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:28):**  in your management?  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:31):**  I think the one thing I've learned over the years is you can't rush somebody on this journey.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:37):**  If I try and rush somebody down the journey, they'll take two steps forward and then they'll  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:42):**  take five steps back.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:43):**  So the most important thing is to go at your own pace and be comfortable with what you're  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:48):**  doing and understand what you're doing.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:50):**  And that's where education and talking, there's so many of us doing it now that we're always  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:55):**  happy to chat and talk to farmers who have gone down the path.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:10:59):**  It's a lot easier than when I was doing it where there wasn't the people I could ask  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:02):**  to try and work it out for myself.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:04):**  And it's not easy.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:05):**  Change isn't easy.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:06):**  It's no good to anybody thinking it's just going to be an easy journey.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:09):**  It is a bit of a roller coaster ride because you're stepping out from the crowd, you're  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:13):**  doing things different and it challenges all of your beliefs because it's almost like starting  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:18):**  to farm all over again from scratch and sort of getting rid of what you've learned and  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:24):**  having to start again.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:25):**  For me, I would say within three on the third year, you really start to see worm numbers  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:31):**  increase.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:32):**  You'll start to see the coming alive again.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:34):**  But the most important thing is to buy a spade and start to understand and see what level  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:38):**  your soil is at.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:39):**  And don't try and run before you can walk.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:42):**  You know, without air in the soil, you can't grow anything.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:45):**  You know, it's as simple as that.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:46):**  So I can't sit here and say you'll be there in three years because I don't know where  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:50):**  you're starting from.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:51):**  And that's the really important one is to buy a spade and get to feel, get to know your  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:56):**  soil.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:57):**  It's what it's all about.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:11:58):**  You know, that connection between farmer and soil is the most important thing.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:02):**  Things can change.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:03):**  You know, we've had two really wet winters here and that's pushed soil back because we  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:08):**  just had so much rain, it's been at field capacity and it hasn't brought the soil on  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:15):**  quite as fast as I'd like.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:17):**  But on the other boot from there, because my soil is in such good condition, infiltration  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:23):**  rates, even though we've had a couple of inches of rain, it will still do an inch every six  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:28):**  minutes.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:29):**  So it's still infiltrating, which is just showing the health of that soil.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:32):**  So there are lots of benefits that you can see and it's observing, observing what you'll  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:37):**  see rather than just looking at it every day and not getting in there and seeing what's  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:41):**  happening.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:42):**  It's, and once you start to see the improvements, I think that's when you really get the enthusiasm  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:47):**  and it just drives you on even faster.

**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:51):**  I guess along that same line, as I've heard you talk about in other interviews, simply  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:12:56):**  reducing chemical inputs, whether that's fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides, can actually have  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:02):**  devastating results for farmers if the land that has been long addicted to these chemicals  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:06):**  is not supported in rebuilding the health that's been lost.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:10):**  How did you do ecological health in your soil to prevent failures when the chemicals stopped  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:16):**  or were reduced?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:18):**  It's been a long path and I sort of, I went at my own pace.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:22):**  So you know, you've, as you've just said that we've made the soil basically a drug addict  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:26):**  and we've given it everything it needs.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:29):**  It hasn't been producing phosphorus.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:31):**  It hasn't been releasing potassium and we've been throwing all this nitrogen on, which  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:35):**  has just made all these weeks out plants.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:37):**  So then disease is going to come in, pests are going to come in because we've made a  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:41):**  very sort of low calorie plant.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:45):**  The environmental level is so low, it's an unhealthy plant and nature wants to take it  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:48):**  out.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:49):**  And it's at the end of the day, we've all got to stop in business.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:51):**  It's no good being the best environmental champion if you're not making any money.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:13:56):**  It's simple as that without being making money, we're out of business and we're not farming  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:00):**  anymore.

**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:03):**  You know, there's no point going cold turkey because you're going to have big problems.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:07):**  It's got to be a reduction, probably 10, 15% of nitrogen each year and see what's happening.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:12):**  Don't just rush in there and do cold turkey because you will fall flat on your face.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:17):**  And as I said, we've all got to stop in business.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:20):**  That's the top priority of this.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:22):**  And it's going at a pace and seeing what's happening.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:25):**  It's no good trying to go from A to Z without putting all the work in in between.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:29):**  And it's no good thinking it's an easy road because you have to work hard at it to get  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:33):**  there.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:34):**  But I'm a big believer, the more you put into life, the more you get out of life.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:37):**  And this is a prime example because the more you start to understand what you're trying  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:41):**  to achieve and what you're doing, the easier the transition is going to be.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:45):**  Yeah, that's fantastic advice.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:48):**  The more you put into life, the more you'll get out of it.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:50):**  And building upon that, as you're reducing some of the inputs that are not building overall  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:14:57):**  health, but are kind of putting a bandaid over the problem, you do need to compensate  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:02):**  with some other things that supported in the transition.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:05):**  Have you found that there are ecological options available for alternative treatments to conventional  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:11):**  insect and disease management?  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:13):**  Yeah, I mean, basically, with the insect management, insects are only coming in to take the trash  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:18):**  out.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:19):**  It's as simple as that.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:20):**  If you've got a pest problem is because you've got an unhealthy plant, which is normally  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:23):**  because you've done a cultivation, there'd be lots of mineralization of nitrogen that  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:27):**  plants suck in that nitrogen in.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:30):**  And then you've got an imbalance and you haven't got the nutrition there to convert those simple  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:34):**  sugars into more complex sugars.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:36):**  And that just attracts those monosaccharides and monofructos, the insects are going to  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:41):**  be in there and are in a feeding frenzy.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:43):**  But if you can put the extra nutrition down there for that plant to be able to move those  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:49):**  sugars into more poly complex sugars, as in polysaccharides, polyfructos, the insects  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:55):**  aren't going to bother with it and be doing that.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:57):**  We'll have a higher Brix reading.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:15:59):**  So you can look as a farmer and think, yeah, we're in a good safe position here.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:04):**  Because once you start to get that high Brix reading, we're just safe then.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:07):**  And so insects are only ever there to take the trash out.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:10):**  They're never there.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:11):**  They wouldn't be there normally.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:12):**  It's just, we've created a problem.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:14):**  Most of the problems we have is what we've done as farmers, but we didn't know any better.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:18):**  It's no good beating ourselves up.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:19):**  It's the most important thing is to make the change and start to move forward again.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:24):**  Yeah, that's very important.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:25):**  There's definitely, at least from our side, no idea of pointing fingers or making bad  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:31):**  guys out of different situations.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:33):**  All of us have come to this point collectively, and we collectively need to support each other  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:38):**  to get back on the right track.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:42):**  And so we've been speaking kind of generally right now about bringing biology and health  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:47):**  back into the ecosystem, into the soil.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:50):**  But every situation is different.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:52):**  Not everybody is starting from the same baseline of soil health.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:56):**  Some peoples are destroyed.  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:58):**  Others are actually pretty decent.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:16:59):**  But there's also fluctuations in climate and regulatory systems.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:04):**  Every context is unique.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:06):**  And so what would you give as advice for starting to analyze your starting position and build  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:12):**  a strategy that is unique to your situation to get back on the right track?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:17):**  What are some of those first steps?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:20):**  The most important step to me is to get a spade and get out there and walk your fields  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:25):**  and really get to know it.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:26):**  Then I'd start to have some biological tests done and just see what sort of level your  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:30):**  soil is at.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:32):**  If it's alive or if it's a totally dead soil, because you'll start to see that.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:38):**  There's loads of devices out there now that we can actually test and see what fungi ratio  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:44):**  to bacteria we've got.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:45):**  So there's lots of things you can do to start to get a grade.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:48):**  I mean, an infiltration test is a very simple way of seeing how healthy your soil is.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:53):**  If you can just make a ring, lock it into the soil, measure up and just see how long  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:17:58):**  it takes to infiltrate an inch of water and then do it the following year and the following  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:18:03):**  year, you'll start to see how your soil is improving or should be.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:18:06):**  And that is a very, very simple way of just measuring that soil.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:18:11):**  For sure.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:18:12):**  Now, as you were starting to figure all of this out, where did you find support and assistance  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:18:18):**  in perhaps your experiments or trying new things or kind of accelerating the learning

**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:18:33):**  I've probably got about 120 books on the subject.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:18:36):**  So I read an awful lot.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:18:38):**  I knew where I wanted to go.

**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:19:09):**  are always normally, most regen farmers are more than happy to share because the more  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:19:13):**  we all share and work together, the faster we're going to move forward.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:19:17):**  That's what I always loved about regen when I started to get into it.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:19:21):**  Everybody wants to help each other and it's a lovely community.

**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:20:38):**  ideas about how to get on the right track towards regenerative management.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:20:43):**  How has their support and their advice been key in helping you get past some of the sticking  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:20:49):**  points in a transition?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:20:52):**  It's always nice.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:20:53):**  I have some quite wacky ideas and it's only certain people I can run those ideas past.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:20:59):**  And so that's probably the best is when I come up with a wacky idea that they don't  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:04):**  laugh at me or think I'm wacky, they just, ah, okay.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:08):**  And we'll throw that around and talk it over and I could quite easily do all my own agronomy  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:13):**  and do it all myself.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:14):**  Well, I feel I'm in too much of a bubble on farm and you don't sometimes you need somebody  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:21):**  else who's looking into your bubble to see what's happening rather than you being in  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:25):**  your bubble on your own and you're making all the decisions.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:28):**  And I think to have somebody come in and we can talk things over, sometimes I'll stick  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:34):**  to what I wanted to do.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:35):**  Sometimes I might change a little bit because they've pointed something out that I didn't  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:39):**  quite see.

**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:44):**  throw the ideas around.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:46):**  The other beauty, you know, when somebody's going around lots of farms, they can see what's  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:51):**  happening in a big area, you know, even all across our country.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:21:56):**  And so they'll give you more information, feedback where I'm just on farm and in that  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:01):**  bubble, I don't, I'm not open to all that of what's going on in the country.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:05):**  I think just having somebody to talk things over sometimes is invaluable because we spend  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:10):**  so much time on our own as farmers.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:12):**  I think, you know, mental health is a big thing and to be able to talk to somebody sometimes,  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:16):**  you know, when you've got a problem that you can't find the solutions, it's invaluable  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:19):**  in my mind.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:20):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:21):**  And I've really found the same thing.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:23):**  I mean, I myself have been working as a consultant and a designer for projects all around the  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:28):**  world for a number of years now.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:30):**  And I'm just on the cusp of starting a project myself.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:34):**  And I am going back to my network of experts and consultants, even though I have an idea  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:39):**  of what they're going to say, having that outside perspective, and just like you said,  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:45):**  someone looking over your shoulder who perhaps sees a bigger picture and can remove themselves  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:50):**  sometimes from that tunnel vision that's very easily created when you're in it every day,  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:22:55):**  when, you know, you've got the stress of having to get work done and make management decisions.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:01):**  Just that little bit of distance can be so key.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:03):**  And it's one of the reasons why consulting is built into the Pioneer program that we're  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:08):**  offering over this next year is because taken on an individual basis, consulting fees can  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:15):**  often be somewhat prohibitive, but by gaining access to the big network of professionals  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:22):**  and experienced practitioners around Europe, we have seen that our farmers have been able  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:27):**  to make leaps and bounds past what they were capable of working by themselves.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:33):**  You know, sometimes having a professional assistance can make a really big difference  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:39):**  in the learning curve, especially if this is something that you're new to.

**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:53):**  What have you observed that are some of the biggest hurdles for other conventional growers  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:23:58):**  to get past before they can find success in regenerative farming?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:02):**  What are some of the sticking points that you see a lot of people getting hung up on?  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:06):**  The biggest one, as I said, when I was talking to John, it's always what's between your two  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:11):**  ears, that's the biggest problem because it's just unlearning a lot of things that you believe  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:16):**  and relearning.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:17):**  So it's been open and opening the door and not being tunnel visioned and looking for  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:24):**  what can be achieved without using the chemicals.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:26):**  I mean, I don't use pre-emergent herbicides anymore.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:30):**  I don't use insecticides and I don't use fungicides.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:33):**  That first year time when you stop using a fungicide and if you go to a local talk or  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:40):**  something and all the farmers will be telling you how much they've put on and how bad the  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:43):**  situation is, you'll pick up a farming magazine and I can guarantee every spring in our farming  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:49):**  magazines, it will say how bad disease is going to be and you've got to put this on  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:24:52):**  and you've got to put that on.

**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:26:26):**  And like you mentioned very importantly earlier, if it doesn't work out for your business,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:26:32):**  you can do all of the ecological practices that you want, but it's not going to be sustainable  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:26:36):**  into the future.

**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:26:42):**  to communicate because there are people who think that, oh, well, I, you know, for whatever  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:26:46):**  reason I had to use glyphosate this year or it was just necessary to save this crop and  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:26:51):**  I had to use this chemical.

**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:27:47):**  It wouldn't be the end of the world.

**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:28:16):**  It's just always looking for the positives rather than the negative.

**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:20):**  And I say I do like a challenge, but it's just for me to always remember where you're  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:25):**  trying to be and where you want to be in the next five years time.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:28):**  And knowing that we can't keep killing our soil, you know, we use fungicides, insecticides  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:33):**  and herbicides.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:34):**  The one thing they've all got in common to me is suicide.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:37):**  We cannot keep killing the vital resource that we've got as a farmer.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:44):**  Very well said.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:45):**  And look, Tim, I have taken up too much of this interview with my own questions.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:49):**  I can see in the chat that there are a lot of great and very specific questions for you  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:54):**  there.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:55):**  And before I open it up to the listeners to ask their own questions, I would remind you  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:30:59):**  that a lot of the questions that I'm seeing are very specific to the way that Tim is managing  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:04):**  his land.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:06):**  And it may not apply to your context, even if he tells you exactly how he applies certain  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:12):**  rates of nitrogen over certain hectares of his field or what kind of seed treatments  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:17):**  that he uses.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:19):**  Remember that the patterns and the understanding here are what's important.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:23):**  And though the specific techniques may be working for Tim, they may not work for you.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:29):**  So it's not necessarily transferable advice.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:32):**  But with that said, if you would like to answer a question.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:36):**  I have a quick question.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:38):**  Yes, Joshua.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:40):**  Hey, are you finding any markets or better prices for your goods while you're in like  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:45):**  the transition to regenerative?  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:48):**  Are the customers, the clients out there appreciating that?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:51):**  And because it's the and not or a lot of the times when you're farming.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:31:55):**  So as you're pulling away from all the sides, are you getting better prices in the interim  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:00):**  or not at the moment?  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:03):**  No, it's something I'm working on.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:05):**  There's a group of us working together called the Green Farm Collective.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:09):**  And we're trying to do just that because we believe that there is a more of a better market  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:14):**  and we should be getting paid a higher price for the food we're producing now because one  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:19):**  we're net zero.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:20):**  So we know we're not carbon positive with all our food.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:24):**  And it will be what I'd like to think it'll be more nutritional food.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:27):**  And obviously hasn't got all the poisons on it.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:30):**  So I think something I might be towards Joshua, that's all I can say.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:34):**  I asked that because I have somebody I want to connect you with who's actually helping  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:37):**  farmers in the US get better prices while they're in transition.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:41):**  And she's really she really drives home the point that it's and not or as we're transitioning  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:47):**  not to leave you all behind just because you're not 100% organic yet.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:50):**  So thank you.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:51):**  That'd be fantastic.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:52):**  Thank you.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:53):**  Yeah, and by all means, continue to put things like this any links or connections or even  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:32:59):**  your own contact information if you'd like to share it in the chat here while we're speaking.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:04):**  Thanks so much, Jonathan.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:05):**  It's great to see you on this call.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:06):**  I know it's been a while since you and I connected, but I'm really glad you're here.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:09):**  All right, who else would like to ask a question?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:12):**  Yeah, no, my name is Vinnie.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:16):**  And my question is, what crops you are planting and what you are crop rotation.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:23):**  I grow quite a wide rotation as wide as I can.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:31):**  I'm 50 50.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:32):**  So winter spring cropping, winter cropping, I would be winter milling wheat.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:39):**  And winter oil seed rate winter canola.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:43):**  And then spring cropping, I would be spring beans, spring lupins, spring goats, spring  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:52):**  barley.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:53):**  And then I've also got grass in the rotation because I make hay for the horses and that  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:33:57):**  would be on a three year, four year late, rotated all around the farm.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:02):**  And before every spring crop, there would always be a cover crop grown.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:07):**  The cover crop could be either one to improve fertility or it could be just to improve general  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:14):**  soil health.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:15):**  So I'll have as much variation in that cover crop as I can because the more variation I've  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:20):**  got above ground, the more variation I'll have below ground as in feeding different  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:24):**  microbes within the soil.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:25):**  Did that answer your question, Rene?  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:28):**  Yeah, answered my question.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:30):**  I would second a little question, you have animals in your farm, on your farm?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:39):**  We used to be a mixed farm.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:40):**  I do have sheep coming to graze some of the cover crops in the autumn.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:45):**  So I've got sheep here now.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:48):**  I haven't got our own livestock.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:50):**  No, I used to think livestock was very essential.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:54):**  But I think what I've proved with the cover crops, the exudates of the cover crops are  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:34:59):**  what's making our organic matter.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:01):**  And I'm pretty sure I can do it without animals.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:05):**  And I used to think it was impossible where now I'm not so sure about that.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:09):**  I think I'm proving I can do it just by growing that varied cover crop because I'm creating  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:14):**  that compost within the soil just by the variation of cover crops.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:19):**  But I still think animals play a big part, don't get me wrong, but I haven't got the  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:22):**  animals at my disposal.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:23):**  So I've had to do it the opposite way.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:26):**  Thank you.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:27):**  All right, go ahead.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:28):**  We'll go to the next.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:29):**  Who would like to ask their question?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:30):**  OK, I'll ask Mike.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:33):**  Did you only add nitrogen fixing bacteria?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:39):**  What else did you add?  
**[0:35:41-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:41):**  And you added it to the seed as a seed treatment or did you spray it in the seed row?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:51):**  I always spray it in the seed row.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:53):**  I brew up nitrogen fixing bacteria.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:35:58):**  I also brew up phosphorus releasing bacteria and I'll also brew up trichoderma.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:36:04):**  So I'll always use the dressings, obviously, but I'll always have seed tested to make sure

**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:36:23):**  So that's what the trichoderma is there.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:36:27):**  It's a very aggressive fungi.

**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:36:52):**  I use a peristaltic pump on my drill.

**[0:37:07-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:37:07):**  there next to the seed.

**[0:37:13-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:37:13):**  to put down by the seed.

**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:37:19):**  It can be as dirty as you like, and it doesn't need a filter in it.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:37:22):**  It can just pump away all day.

**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:37:43):**  We say it's one of the most important things that you can do to be able to apply that biology.

**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:38:13):**  I think it's a vital part of my old farming strategy of what I do.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:38:19):**  I'll also put diatomaceous earth down at drilling, diatomaceous earth, a micro-diatomaceous earth.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:38:25):**  We just allow that plant to get the silicon back in, so I'm putting that defence system  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:38:29):**  there straight away.

**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:39:28):**  It's just not getting that seed to micro contact straight away.

**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:45:18):**  before you go in and start making changes to the management itself?  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:45:22):**  Definitely.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:45:23):**  You've got to know what you're dealing with.

**[0:45:47-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:45:47):**  Don't be shy.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:45:48):**  Hi, Tim.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:45:49):**  It's Miriam again.  
**[0:45:51-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:45:51):**  I was just going to ask, with regard to nitrogen, we found that we have much, much better results  
**[0:46:01-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:01):**  if we change the form of nitrogen that our farmers are using from something like urea  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:08):**  to an ammonium-based one.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:11):**  Are you finding the same thing or because you're using a lot foliar, do you find it  
**[0:46:16-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:16):**  doesn't hurt to use that nitrate-based or urea-based nitrogen?  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:23):**  I still use ammonium sulphate as the soil applied.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:27):**  I don't use urea.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:29):**  And then the foliar applied, I use an amide end, which starts off as urea, but it's more  
**[0:46:34-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:34):**  of an amino acid.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:35):**  It's made that transition.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:36):**  So I don't find it quite as damaging to the biology.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:42):**  And obviously it doesn't need as much energy from the plant because it's already been converted  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:46):**  in that to that amino acid.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:48):**  It's just one step behind the amino acid.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:50):**  So I have great success with that and I can balance it because it's flex fertiliser, which  
**[0:46:58-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:58):**  comes from Denmark.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:46:59):**  And so from that, I can add any, because I do a lot of sap testing, if I'm lacking in  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:03):**  something when I'm doing that application, I can balance the plant.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:08):**  So I do try and steer clear of urea.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:12):**  Thank you.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:13):**  I was just wondering if you've done any trials or use any silicon products on farm and how  
**[0:47:18-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:18):**  you got on with them?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:20):**  I use diatomaceous earth, which obviously gets converted into monosyllic acid.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:26):**  And then I also use potassium silicate.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:29):**  So between the two, the diatomaceous earth goes down the drilling and the potassium silicate  
**[0:47:34-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:34):**  is what I use as a failure.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:36):**  And I've got on really well with that.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:41):**  You have some books that you open your mind especially, or what books are you prefer?  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:48):**  And then you, yeah.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:52):**  That's a difficult one.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:53):**  It depends what stage of the journey you're on really.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:47:55):**  I think David Montgomery is a really good book, Dirt, the growing revolution.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:02):**  There's a starting point because he'll just talk through how all past societies, the only  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:07):**  reason they failed within the world because they didn't look after their soil.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:11):**  The Roman army couldn't feed itself in the end because it didn't look after their soil.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:14):**  And I think that's a real good starting point for anybody to realise we're on that exact  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:20):**  same path that they were on because it goes over a hundred years.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:24):**  No one generation can remember what it used to be like and so you just accept it.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:29):**  And I think that to me is another light bulb moment that you realise we're only here for  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:33):**  a short time and that soil is here longer.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:36):**  We don't see the degradation we've done to the soil because it's over such a long period  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:40):**  of time.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:41):**  But to me, we're headed on that slope.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:43):**  If we don't start and act now and regenerate our soil, we've just followed the same pattern.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:49):**  And people will often say to me, oh, well, we've got to stop in business.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:52):**  And we have.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:53):**  I totally agree.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:54):**  If we can't stop in business, if we're not sustainable as it's repairing the damage,  
**[0:48:57-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:57):**  we've gone to our soil.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:48:58):**  It's like any machine, if you don't maintain it, it breaks in the end.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:02):**  And that's where we are with the soil.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:04):**  It's doing a balance and not going too fast.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:07):**  So as we stop profitable, we're making more money.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:09):**  But at the same time, we're repairing the damage.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:12):**  And that to me is where we should all be as farmers.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:15):**  And it doesn't always go to plan.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:17):**  We've got to have that vision in mind of where we're going.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:20):**  And so David Montgomery is a real good starting point.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:24):**  There's a chap called Jeff Lowenfels.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:26):**  He's very good on biology.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:28):**  That's an old book.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:29):**  It's a good one to start reading about biology.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:34):**  Matt Parmer's Regeneration of Soil or something like that is another good book just to get  
**[0:49:39-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:39):**  you going.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:40):**  There's loads of good books out there.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:42):**  And so sometimes it's worth rereading them twice because as you go further down the journey,  
**[0:49:47-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:47):**  you get more out of it when you read it the second time.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:50):**  Thank you.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:51):**  Welcome.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:52):**  Tim, it's Miriam again.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:54):**  I was just checking.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:49:55):**  You were talking about the different composts that you're starting to work with now.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:03):**  Have you tried to use the Johnson's Sioux beam approach or how do you approach the composting?  
**[0:50:09-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:09):**  What sorts of ways do you do that?  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:11):**  I've tried the Johnson's Sioux.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:15):**  I haven't had as much success as I expected from Johnson's Sioux.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:18):**  So I've gone back to how I always made compost.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:21):**  So I just make it probably two foot high on a pallet.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:25):**  So it's aerated all the way around and I can just control it more.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:29):**  What I found with the Johnson's Sioux, it all collapsed in on the vents and then some  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:33):**  bits of it were very wet.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:35):**  Some bits were very dry and I couldn't control the environment as I wanted to.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:39):**  So I've gone back to a smaller amount like I've always done.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:43):**  And I'm having some good successes with that.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:46):**  Sometimes I'll add some different fungi spores in there to make it a more fungal compost  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:50):**  or whatever I'm going for.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:52):**  And I'll try different ingredients.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:54):**  It's a learning curve for me, but I just didn't have the success with the Johnson's Sioux  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:50:59):**  as I thought I would.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:01):**  I'd say one thing is if you had to do this all again, what would be the one thing you  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:05):**  would repeat?  
**[0:51:06-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:06):**  It's a loaded question, I know, but if you can answer it, it would be great.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:14):**  One of the mistakes I made earlier on, I dropped nitrogen too fast and I did have a yield penalty.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:19):**  So I wouldn't make that mistake again.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:20):**  I was trying to run before I could walk.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:24):**  And the knowledge I've got now, I probably wouldn't go down the strip till route because  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:27):**  I can do it without, but again, that's only on land I know.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:33):**  I'm not saying it's wrong because in some instances the strip till will be very good  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:37):**  and very useful.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:38):**  So, but for me, I could have made, I know I've taken some land on recently and I've  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:43):**  just gone straight into no till with cover crops because I understand far more what I'm  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:47):**  doing now.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:48):**  But it was all a learning curve for me and it was probably essential for me with what  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:53):**  between my two ears to go down that learning curve.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:51:56):**  I couldn't have done what I'm doing now, sort of 10 years ago.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:52:00):**  It's been a joy ride, I suppose, a roller coaster ride up and down.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:52:07):**  Never always goes to plan.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:52:09):**  Just keeping focused of where you want to go and talk to people, but whatever problem  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:52:13):**  you've had, I can guarantee somebody else has had the problem.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/timothy-parton-on-the-steps-to-weaning-your-land-off-chemical-inputs/#t=0:52:17):**  That's why it's important just to talk to people.

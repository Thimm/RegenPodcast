**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in.

**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:17):**  Here we are, the end of 2019 and season 3 of this podcast.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:22):**  For those of you who've been following the show for a while, you know that I went through  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:25):**  a lot of big changes this year, most notably a big move from the permaculture farm setup  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:30):**  that I worked on for about 16 months in Guatemala, and from there I took some big trips through  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:36):**  southern Mexico and the US and a bit in Canada, to where I finally settled down in the Catalunya  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:41):**  region of northeastern Spain.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:43):**  Now though I live really far away from where I started the year, I thought it'd be a  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:47):**  good chance here at the end of the season to check in with Neil Hegarty, the co-owner  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:51):**  of Granja Siquín in Guatemala, where this year began for me, to see how things have  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:57):**  progressed and developed since I moved away.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:01:59):**  I know a lot of you followed along on our journey through the regenerative roundtable  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:03):**  sessions of last season as we planned and started building out the design for the farm,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:08):**  so hearing how the design has started to mature should be a good update.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:12):**  In this interview, Neil fills me in on how the animal enterprises that were just taking  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:17):**  shape while I was there are becoming more consistent and regimented, and how they feed  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:21):**  the other enterprises on the farm like the cafe restaurant, the permaculture courses,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:26):**  the development of the hostel space, and much more.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:29):**  They've also made some important alliances in their community and around Guatemala that  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:33):**  are helping them reach more people in their village in their goal to facilitate a better  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:38):**  market for high quality local farm products and a better price for wholesale goods.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:43):**  We also talk about some of the promising big design projects that Neil is taking on, which  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:47):**  have the potential to regenerate large acreage of damaged land in some of the most biodiverse  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:53):**  regions of Pitén in the north of the country.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:56):**  As I mentioned, this episode wraps it up for season 3.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:02:59):**  2019 was a really major year for me personally and for the audience of this podcast.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:05):**  Together with you who are listening now, we more than doubled the subscribers to this  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:08):**  show and got so much beautiful and heartfelt feedback from so many of you that it really  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:13):**  renewed my faith that this show is bringing the information and inspiration that many  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:18):**  of you are looking for.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:19):**  So thank you sincerely to everyone who has supported the show and sent feedback this  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:23):**  year, it means the world to me.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:25):**  And thanks so much to New Society Publars especially for their collaboration and support

**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:36):**  Being able to advocate for an organization with integrity and strong ethics means the  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:40):**  world to me.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:41):**  So season 4 of the Abundant Edge podcast will kick off strong again with brand new episodes  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:46):**  starting on February 7th.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:48):**  But stay tuned before then because I'll be reposting the most popular shows from this  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:52):**  last year again until I return.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:55):**  So now I'll hand things over to Neil.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:03:58):**  Hey Neil, great to be talking to you again.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:01):**  How's everything going down in Guatemala?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:03):**  Yeah Oliver, good to hear your voice.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:06):**  Things are going great.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:08):**  Really, really busy but yeah things are going really well.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:13):**  Yeah I would imagine you guys are just coming out of the rainy season while you're probably  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:16):**  about a month out now and getting into the high season for tourism in that area.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:20):**  It must be gorgeous right now, no?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:23):**  Yeah it's beautiful.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:24):**  This is like the nicest time of year in a way because you know the rainy season was  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:28):**  it was an intense rainy season.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:30):**  It rained a lot and then just kind of stopped bang dead on the start of November.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:36):**  Kind of like I scheduled.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:39):**  Now everything's still really green after the rainy season but it's like it's kind of  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:43):**  a little cooler at night and it's just warm and sunny during the day so it's a lovely  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:49):**  time to be here.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:50):**  Awesome.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:51):**  Well here look I think it's great that we have the opportunity to catch up here as you  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:04:55):**  guys are heading into the third year of the Gran Jacyquín project.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:00):**  And I'd love to talk about all of the different things that have been developing since the  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:04):**  last year since I was kind of involved with the project.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:07):**  It sounds like you guys are doing some amazing stuff and really expanding on those little  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:11):**  enterprises that you were developing when I was there last.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:14):**  Do you want to tell me a little bit about some of the major projects that you've been  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:17):**  pushing forward?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:19):**  Yeah in some ways it's been about like dialing in and doing better what we were already doing  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:26):**  in a way.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:27):**  I think when you were here we'd established a lot of interesting prototypes.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:32):**  You know the gold house above the chicken house and that kind of fall down compost system.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:39):**  The coffee processing, the cheese making, all those things were like they were working  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:45):**  but we needed to kind of like dial them in.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:48):**  So it's been a lot about that I would say.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:51):**  And then the house also like getting the house finished and fit for purpose has also been  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:55):**  like has taken a lot of energy.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:05:58):**  So yeah that's a lot of it.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:00):**  We built this year the it was definitely the most fun thing I've ever designed.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:06):**  We were racking our brains trying to think of how to set up a proper system for drying  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:15):**  our coffee.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:18):**  And we were thinking if you remember where the chicken house is just below the gold house  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:22):**  we were thinking of just putting a very strong roof over that.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:28):**  But then we were kind of looking at it actually with Chewy, Chris who used to be here, we  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:33):**  were looking at it with him and we were sort of saying like well this is going to take  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:37):**  so many posts to make this roof strong enough to walk on because it's a big area that we  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:42):**  had to roof in.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:44):**  And eventually actually Lorenzo from Daddy Leo Chocolate happened to be here and we were  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:47):**  sort of sitting around kind of talking this out and he was like well why don't you just  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:54):**  this is the best this spot has the best view on the farm why don't you just put a deck  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:06:58):**  over the over the animal house and then a light roof on top of that and you can dry  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:04):**  your coffee on that.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:05):**  So that's what we did.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:07):**  And then while I was building it it took like a good amount of engineering so we were super  
**[0:07:12-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:12):**  glad that Chewy was here and we but we figured it out and now the deck is finished and then  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:21):**  we built like a vertical solar dryer for the coffee in one section of it over on the western  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:27):**  and over on the western side.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:30):**  So that we've got like vertical so we take advantage of vertical space and all the wind  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:34):**  that flows through there so that's actually working really well and now the coffee dries  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:37):**  down into the animal house and then as well as having a place to dry coffee we have a  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:43):**  space for doing yoga in the morning and like a big restaurant space it's got a great view  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:49):**  the lake and then at night we started doing events up there as well kind of like farming.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:55):**  It's like definitely of all the things that have ever been involved in designing and building  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:07:59):**  it was like it's like the most multifunctional thing that we've ever done I think.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:04):**  Well so tell me a little bit more about the vertical dryer for the coffee because it's  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:06):**  one of the few things I haven't seen pictures of on the new website is it a matter of like  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:11):**  taking out racks that you then fill and they're stacked on top of each other and then drain  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:15):**  out into the compost below?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:18):**  Exactly exactly it's a it's how big are those racks like a frame the each rack is about  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:24):**  two meters long and maybe 80 centimeters wide.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:28):**  Okay yeah pretty big.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:30):**  Yeah so now you can fit you know each one fits a couple of like five gallon buckets  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:36):**  of coffee and then yeah that's exactly what we do we put the wettest coffee down low and  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:41):**  then when it's like dried a bit we move it up and so we have three levels to the thing  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:45):**  we're actually thinking of putting in a fourth level now because there's more coffee coming  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:49):**  in but it dries really quick because as you can imagine that's like our wind zone as well  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:08:54):**  that's where the wind comes in off the lake and it rushes through there so it's perfect  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:00):**  and that same wind also because you know animal houses no matter how well you manage them  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:05):**  some tend to smell but ours just doesn't at all because I think because how much we move  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:09):**  that compost and also because we get that wind just flowing through there all the time  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:13):**  so it also then works great as a restaurant space and it's really what kind of what we're  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:19):**  all about at the at the restaurant is like you know you're going to see exactly where  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:22):**  your food comes from and how it's made it's kind of like a nice vantage point within the  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:26):**  farm people can look down and see the chickens they can even throw their food waste straight  
**[0:09:30-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:30):**  down into them closing all those loops and stacking functions so that yeah that man that  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:43):**  was so much fun so satisfying to see that that actually come together I felt like I  
**[0:09:49-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:49):**  learned a lot about kind of structural engineering from Billy as well so no it was a great project  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:09:58):**  and so that and yeah like I said dialing in the other things that we have like I actually  
**[0:10:05-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:05):**  think the best thing like this sort of smartest thing I did in a way in my whole life maybe  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:13):**  was was thinking this we were really racking our brains to think of how can how can we age  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:18):**  cheeses without building a cellar because we didn't really have money to build a proper  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:23):**  cellar so eventually I started talking to Chico here our our carpenter who's an amazing  
**[0:10:30-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:30):**  like real artist and I had these coolers you know those like big cooler boxes that people  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:38):**  take picnics of so I had the idea with Chico we just basically built a frame that fits  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:43):**  into them that you can close the lid over but that sits right across the top and has  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:49):**  bars that go kind of vertically across and then we we we tie the cheeses to those bars  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:10:56):**  and hang them and then close the lids out of the coolers so it's meant we can like really  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:01):**  like age our cheeses and and do things without building like a big structure that I'm just  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:06):**  not gonna have money to build for another year or two so like I don't know probably  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:12):**  like make a video or take photos of that yeah you should if you get photos send them over  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:16):**  I'll try and have those out before before this goes live yeah so yeah as an example  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:21):**  of like something like a practical solution that like saved us a ton of money that we  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:28):**  didn't have it was it was definitely a good one so that's a load of in a way to I think  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:34):**  improve the quality of the of the dairy operation the milk that was another thing we got right  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:39):**  this year you know like when you were here we timed the pregnancies of the goats wrong  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:44):**  so that they were like in full production in low season and then they were yeah that  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:50):**  was a tricky thing that was a killer you know that that costs that cost us like thousands  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:11:57):**  of quetzales and so we got that like spot on this year we got a we got a good mail in  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:03):**  at the right time and they got they were pregnant for the whole of low season so how did it  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:09):**  go with that breeding program I know you were mentioning about like trying to get a better  
**[0:12:12-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:12):**  breed in there specifically for milking is that what you got yeah yeah I did like actually  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:20):**  took like a week at one point last year or actually I can't remember when it was and  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:26):**  I just went around and I just went goat farmer hunting and I visited like I just asked a  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:33):**  bunch of people before I left like who who does the best go who has the best goat operation  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:37):**  in Guatemala and I found like one guy in particular who was just really doing it right a guy in  
**[0:12:43-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:43):**  tech fine done mako and a character so he really connected so I bought a couple of females  
**[0:12:52-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:12:52):**  off him and and we came back with those and then he also I got a mail from him as well  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:02):**  so that mail was the one who did the business this time around and now also from the previous  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:08):**  round of pregnancies one of the females I brought in from the Macos herd gave birth  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:14):**  to a male so we kept him and we found him so he's gonna be our breeder for next year  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:19):**  that's exciting what have you got the herd up to at this point right now we're at we  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:23):**  got nine producing milk and we got another three that are pregnant no sorry for four  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:30):**  more pregnant ones and so what I want to do with the pregnant ones because that was another  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:34):**  part of the learning decision was that I want to keep three of three or four of them and  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:39):**  not get them pregnant at the end of high season so that they keep producing for us in low  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:45):**  season because we've kind of got to the point where even though low season hits there's  
**[0:13:48-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:48):**  still like a decent demand for milk and that was a flow that we lost this year because  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:13:57):**  you know because we got the herd a little bit more I think like every year it's just  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:03):**  worth bringing in some fresh blood that's one of the things I'm learning that like you  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:07):**  know breeding your own goats is great but there's a sort of like yeah you just need  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:12):**  to keep making effort I think to always bring in like maybe one female or swap one for another  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:17):**  one sure especially at the size of herd that you have because you're not dealing with really  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:21):**  big numbers and it's going to start inbreeding if you don't mix it up often enough yeah and  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:28):**  I'm kind of quickly you know sure sure so let's break down kind of where the farm operation  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:34):**  is and then we'll talk about some of the other enterprises that you have so what is taking  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:39):**  up most of the labor and the time and what's producing most of the economics as far as  
**[0:14:44-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:44):**  the products actually coming off the land yeah that's a good question so right now the  
**[0:14:53-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:14:53):**  garden has been taking up a lot of my energy and I don't actually have I don't really have  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:05):**  the number of the garden scale or like cooking rings like charred spinach kale so we sell  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:11):**  bags of those we also grow a lot of sweet potato onion you know leaks things to be served  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:19):**  in the restaurant eat ourselves all the time so it's a little difficult vegetables we buy  
**[0:15:24-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:24):**  them and you can buy vegetables cheap here but to me it's like so the actual economic  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:33):**  benefit if I was just selling at market prices from the garden to the kitchen it's hard to  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:38):**  say that it would be like a hugely profitable enterprise in a way you'd be maybe talking  
**[0:15:42-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:42):**  about a few hundred kids out the of this sort of experience we provide to our visitors and  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:50):**  also the quality of diet for ourselves the more food that garden produces that you know  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:15:56):**  the better so there's a lot of unquantifiable in the garden I would say and it's definitely  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:01):**  been taking a lot of energy I built a greenhouse a couple of weeks ago with Marcel one of our  
**[0:16:06-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:06):**  long-term volunteers up in the kind of like the Sun Zone up like next to her you know  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:15):**  and like so I started doing a trail there with like four different kinds of tomatoes  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:20):**  you know put them in planter bags in a nursery really spoiling them because I want to one  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:25):**  things I want to do is I want to have like our own my main aim with this actually is  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:30):**  to get the greenhouse set up and also identify one or two varieties of tomato that will produce  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:36):**  for us here because tomatoes in Central America is like not easy yeah I remember there's all  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:42):**  kinds of things we struggled with in the garden last time yeah those work in the garden in  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:48):**  the garden because we well for one we irrigate with a sprinkler so they get their leaves  
**[0:16:53-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:16:53):**  wet they just hate that and they yeah they're they're they're peculiar and the white fly  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:07):**  it's the musk of blanket one if they get if they get attacked by that or they get one  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:11):**  of like a million different sicknesses they seem to be able to get it's it's tough so  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:16):**  but the greenhouse helps because they don't get cold at night and we can also isolate  
**[0:17:19-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:19):**  them from bugs and to me I kind of like the idea of having like one super intensive area  
**[0:17:28-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:28):**  on the farm one like moderately intensive area which is the garden and then like the  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:38):**  rest and so that's also you know I kind of like the ratio the way it is in terms of like  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:44):**  energy input but yeah right now it's still a lot of energy and it's hard to quantify  
**[0:17:49-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:49):**  the gains from that because there's someone out but the thing that brings in the most  
**[0:17:57-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:17:57):**  money per per unit of labor is the goals you know like that's nice business now you know  
**[0:18:06-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:18:06):**  it's like 20 20 they normally go like around the streets just selling leche and yeah so  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:18:16):**  if you kind of extrapolate that price to a leader it's about 30 quetzales for a leader  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:18:20):**  and that's what we sort of sell it at and because you know we sell the cheese for an  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:18:24):**  equivalent price and it's really not that much time at this point you know they get  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:18:30):**  they get walked away today by by locking them and bringing them to different areas all the  
**[0:18:36-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:18:36):**  time we we cut greens from the kind of borders and you know you're maybe talking yeah you  
**[0:18:49-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:18:49):**  may be talking about like four hours of labor all together and it's yeah chickens also you  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:18:58):**  know at this point the chicken is just kind of do their thing they're on the compost piles  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:03):**  they're you know again for like the amount that we put into them and and the and the  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:09):**  value of good quality eggs it's like it's great because a lot of the chickens you know  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:15):**  the chickens a lot of their good diet comes from the fact that we weed the garden every  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:19):**  morning for like an hour and that's the first thing they eat is like a bucket of of greens  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:23):**  from the garden and then they get the previous night's kitchen scraps so it's like the first  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:28):**  they don't get any feed until we give them that you know and then they and then we do  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:33):**  give them a feed like concentrate a medication free concentrate because we put apple cider  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:41):**  vinegar in there which we started brewing from from mothers that we get from love probiotics  
**[0:19:48-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:48):**  you know we mix in the whey from the goats and a bunch of minerals we make biochar we  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:19:56):**  mix in sea salt and ash and all these other things so it's nice that I would say we're  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:01):**  at about like a third of the recommended industry input for grain and we're like at you know  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:08):**  equivalent production and far higher quality so that's working and and I'm looking forward  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:15):**  to kind of like expanding it in a way the compost is is working as well yeah you told  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:23):**  me you really expanded that up tell me what's been the feed for getting that producing even  
**[0:20:28-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:28):**  more than before again it's been like dialing in you know like we had a concept last year  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:36):**  or that we left over the first two years of like cleaning the goat house then I was down  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:43):**  from one level to the next we just like dialed it in you know for one thing we have more  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:49):**  animals there's more there's more volume moving through it we you know we've really the worm  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:20:56):**  system down at the bottom of it like how to be efficient maybe can harness that work up  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:02):**  also that's actually something we're gonna expand in the in the in the coming weeks is  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:07):**  that system but yeah it's just working much more smoothly and also like the kind of word  
**[0:21:13-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:13):**  got out that if you want good organic compost that's a good work so you can actually afford  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:22):**  to be very competitive on placing you know we're even selling you know we're selling  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:27):**  compost to local farmers now as well because they get that it's better than putting chemical  
**[0:21:33-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:33):**  on it and we can be on chemicals on it and we can sorry we can we can be competitive  
**[0:21:45-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:45):**  with the price with the price of you know triple 15 which is what they use there yeah  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:53):**  yeah and then there's a lot of like there's a lot of farmers there's about a lot of foreign  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:21:57):**  landowners here who are doing like landscaping projects and gardening projects and all those  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:02):**  kinds of things and you know having you're not you're not going to go to business making  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:07):**  fertile soil anytime in the next century I don't think yeah for sure well so let's talk  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:14):**  about some of the perennial systems that you guys were just starting to put in when I was  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:18):**  leaving did you guys get the orchard planted this time around or is there still some left  
**[0:22:23-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:23):**  to do there yeah we got about half a bit done it was a lot like it's hard to do that landscaping  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:31):**  here to the level that we wanted to be I just remember how many rocks are on that terrain  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:36):**  that's not easy yeah no no no it was hard so yeah we got about half the landscapes and  
**[0:22:43-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:43):**  it's really nicely landscaped you know it looks great we planted a plant that have most  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:22:56):**  of them have done well I think two of them have died so I realized they need they need  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:01):**  a lot of shade those ones from the young peaches figs lots mulberry around the edges and we  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:08):**  did a nice it was nice in terms of trying out like a kind of successional model as well  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:13):**  because we planted a lot of pigeon pea and sorghum which did great at kind of creating  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:19):**  shade for the young trees but also like gave us really good give us really good yields  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:25):**  so we actually like sorghum blew my mind this year as a perennial grain I was just like  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:30):**  oh my god like we I almost just I just threw seeds of it around almost like a mulch and  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:36):**  they just germinated and did their thing you know we got like oh yeah like about 150 pounds  
**[0:23:44-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:44):**  of sorghum this year and it's just going to grow back next year you know it's amazing  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:53):**  and same with pigeon pea we got good harvest of pigeon pea and then also great amounts  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:23:57):**  of forage and so having those plants and sweet potato is another one but that's kind of what  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:01):**  that was sort of the system we did was like fruit trees and every five meters and some  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:06):**  interesting bushes and other perennials and the distance but then lots and lots of just  
**[0:24:09-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:09):**  like broadcast seeds of pigeon pea and and sorghum and then put down sweet potatoes ground  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:17):**  cover and so it did it did really well you know and like sweet potato we've harvested  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:23):**  some patches of it and a lot of the rest of it I think we just leave it so that the kind  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:27):**  of tubers rot in the ground and it you know those things just go and and and they're they're  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:32):**  also great forage like our chickens love to eat sweet potato leaves so because eventually  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:38):**  once that's out of the yard system with our animals we send our chickens down there and  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:45):**  then over to the other one to let it rest and so that's something I'm really excited  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:50):**  about you know absolutely well I'm really glad to hear that all the ecological aspects  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:24:57):**  have been really moving forward why don't you start to explain a little bit about some  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:01):**  of the community projects that have taken hold I know that you guys are working closer  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:06):**  with Anna Cafe the big organization that helps to govern and promote the cultivation of coffee  
**[0:25:12-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:12):**  in that area tell me how you're working with them yeah that was an interesting one felt  
**[0:25:22-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:22):**  a lot like manifesting this community cooperative because we got a nice model now with the coffee  
**[0:25:30-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:30):**  with Tim and Shangri-La where you know we buy in the coffee we process it we turn all  
**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:38):**  the excess products into into fertility and and Tim roasted and we it's really high quality  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:46):**  coffee because coffee grows so well here but I've been saying for a while it would be sweet  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:50):**  if we could like get a bunch of locals involved and develop our own organic brand and then  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:25:58):**  like right based on my like I think I'm on they were like yo we we heard what you're  
**[0:26:02-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:02):**  doing we give like free capacitations and we sat down I had a look at their manual it's  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:11):**  basically good agroforestry there's a lot of similar things to what we teach in the  
**[0:26:16-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:16):**  permaculture courses you know they teach a good part about soil retention you know working  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:26):**  on contour using green manures that you can chop and drop using the proper shade when  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:33):**  to prune how to prune all these things you know that like really do make a big difference  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:38):**  and basically the only thing is that I had doubts about was their ambivalent about fertility  
**[0:26:44-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:44):**  and I just said look we can do this if if you own if you basically teach them that it  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:51):**  has to be organic coffee and they were kind of doubtful at first but I said look otherwise  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:26:56):**  I'm not doing it they have like a mandate to increase the quality and quantity of coffee  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:03):**  exported from Guatemala every year so it's in their interest to work with us because  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:08):**  we can actually offer the farmers a better price for doing the courses because that's  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:12):**  what happens a lot of the time is they don't they find it hard to get any work done in  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:17):**  the rural areas because coffee prices are so low and the people are just like yeah I'm  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:22):**  doing that again you know I get 80 quince a day for 100 pounds of coffee it's not worth  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:28):**  it so they were psyched to see that we were there and so it was a good alliance and yeah  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:35):**  in the end they were totally I they got it I was like look this is what I want to be  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:38):**  able to pay people more so I want to be able to charge more so I want to get like a proper  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:42):**  organic thing going and that will hopefully create momentum and encourage more people  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:48):**  to switch over and so yeah that's kind of like that's why I plan on a bit the vision  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:27:55):**  in a way with the goats is that a lot of the trees that are great shade species for coffee  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:01):**  are also great forage species for goats so I see a real symbiosis between holistic goat  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:07):**  management and coffee farming because goats don't eat coffee either so you can literally  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:12):**  take them into the cup into the coffee fields you can prune the shade trees and have them  
**[0:28:16-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:16):**  walk along behind you you know and like you know almost my dream would be to I think set  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:25):**  up a few other families with goats and kind of train them how to manage them and include  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:32):**  in the workshops that you know this is some this is a free service that you can basically  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:39):**  have some of goats have someone's goats come onto your land they'll prune your trees for  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:43):**  you and the goats will clean the undergrowth and poop everywhere you know so that would  
**[0:28:48-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:48):**  be like I don't know I guess that's my like five or ten year like master plan.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:28:57):**  Now that's super exciting so within this this kind of larger vision of how all of these  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:03):**  things interconnect tell me about some of the enterprises that are help giving sort  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:07):**  of an economic justification for these things that in the global or in the Guatemalan smaller  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:13):**  market are hard to sell especially farm goods sort of at a wholesale price even if they  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:17):**  are of higher value but you've got the cafe and you've got now the hostel which you've  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:23):**  turned the the original house design into support kind of a larger gathering space than  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:29):**  the original design tell me how that's evolved.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:33):**  Yeah I guess it's really two questions like the first one about like how do you actually  
**[0:29:37-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:37):**  make sustainable agriculture viable. Yeah that's like the kind of the million dollar  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:45):**  question in a way in Guatemala we're lucky that we have like tourist market here where  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:50):**  we can sort of charge you know fair prices for the quality of the food we're producing  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:29:54):**  but it is hard to it's hard to bridge that gap a little bit I think it's a little bit  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:00):**  like Joel Salatin says sometimes you just have to put on another hat something you know  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:04):**  he says you know people always complain that the middlemen get all the money in agriculture  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:10):**  and he says well if you don't like it then just be the middleman you know wear that hat  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:15):**  and that was kind of something that stayed with me so we do make a big enough a big effort  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:19):**  I would say to to think about like the distribution and marketing of our products and all that  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:24):**  kind of stuff and that's where working having the cooperative model with Atidlan Organics  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:29):**  has been a real help because we can sort of split the effort of transport and marketing  
**[0:30:35-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:35):**  and we can also pool sales so when Shad gets an order for salad he's like oh we also can  
**[0:30:42-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:42):**  offer cheese and yogurt and bags of kale so that that helps a lot and you know vice versa  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:50):**  and I you know I think it all goes back to the importance of cooperatives really the  
**[0:30:56-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:30:56):**  cooperative model did largely fall apart here in the civil war and you can go into why that  
**[0:31:04-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:31:04):**  was maybe on a different show yeah that that had a big effect on the way agriculture works  
**[0:31:15-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:31:15):**  in the country I think it's very exploitative here where most people very much work to produce  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:31:22):**  commodities that are exported and and have value added to them like enormously multiple  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:31:29):**  types of things they don't see any of that profit so yeah it's an unfortunate story common  
**[0:31:34-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:31:34):**  in the global sun yeah and that's why we would like to have our own kind of fair trade organic  
**[0:31:41-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:31:41):**  coffee for example in Sununah that has like almost like worldwide appeal and you know  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:31:49):**  because we'd love to what we're hoping to do as well with this coffee project is make  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:31:54):**  it available as an international volunteer kind of experience especially kind of marketed  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:01):**  especially sort of designed for like people who are specifically interested in learning  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:07):**  about agroforestry and are specifically interested in reforestation because you know so we can  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:14):**  do we want to set up a kind of a program here where groups who want to learn about those  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:18):**  types of things can come here you know learn a bit of the theory of of agroforestry and  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:24):**  what what it is and why it's important and how to do the basics of how to do it right  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:28):**  and then actually just go and help a local person to join this organic cooperative that  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:33):**  have have the right support trees planted on their land have like permanent soil retention  
**[0:32:39-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:39):**  work done so that's like I guess it's a way we're trying to find like positive interactions  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:47):**  between the tourist industry here and the sort of ecology of the area if you know what  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:53):**  I mean so a lot of what we're doing aside as well as that program is like is looking  
**[0:32:58-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:32:58):**  for to find those kinds of symbiotic relationships I guess you'd say so yeah that's very much  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:07):**  the idea with the hostel is it's the place where volunteers can come and stay you know  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:14):**  we charge like a very competitive normal hostel rate and then we actually give a discount  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:20):**  on that rate and we give two meals to our to our loft or to our volunteers were staying  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:24):**  for for two weeks or longer and that's been so we built it we built a dormitory onto the  
**[0:33:31-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:31):**  side of the house you know put in like nice bunk beds and it's super cozy you know and  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:40):**  with the deck that's now finished it makes for a nice kind of community kind of yeah  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:46):**  just chill sorts of tense and tends to attract like similar types of people who are interested  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:52):**  in permaculture and having a different type of tourist experience and so it's a great  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:33:58):**  way that people can kind of come here live economically and eat super well eat from the  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:04):**  farm but also support this project you know which is what kind of what it's all about  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:09):**  we're increasingly now looking sending some of our longer term volunteers are starting  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:13):**  to help out with the with the community project that's happening here where we're doing a  
**[0:34:17-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:17):**  lot of in conjunction with at the time organics we're doing a lot of like local gardens and  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:25):**  grey water systems and sometimes of house repair and things like that for for families  
**[0:34:31-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:31):**  here in Sununna so and that that program is expanding as well you know we plan to do we  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:41):**  plan to do like I say a lot more reforestation rainy season and also to set up more and more  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:48):**  community members to be organic producers in the area so that's kind of like where a  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:52):**  lot of the focus is at the moment because really with the water here in Sununna and  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:34:56):**  the climate we we there's no reason we have to be sort of like food sovereign in the area  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:01):**  but it you know what it requires working I guess on a lot of different levels of course  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:07):**  of course yeah the complex dynamics of bringing that many different elements to work in conjunction  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:12):**  but it's you know it's always fun and it's a huge learning experience it's definitely  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:16):**  what I got from it and with that in mind I know you're also doing a lot of work outside  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:22):**  of the the immediate community and starting to consult and design for bigger projects  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:27):**  you want to tell me about some of the stuff you're working on these days yeah it's been  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:31):**  exciting man it's been it really started to take off I think probably not coincidentally  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:38):**  just a right around the same time that this place started to look really nice and actually  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:42):**  be productive I think people started to kind of come and see it and work and be like whoa  
**[0:35:47-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:35:47):**  I want one of those so yeah it was it was good let me see the first really big exciting  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:01):**  one that came in was a project in Antigua to do like a like an eco community this I  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:06):**  bought a bought a big piece of land like 20 acres up outside of Antigua in the mountains  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:12):**  and he he decided he wanted to do like a permaculture design on the whole property and then sell  
**[0:36:19-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:19):**  like lots to his friends so he was you know and it's it's a beautiful property it's a  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:27):**  it's actually mostly a hass avocado kind of monoculture and it was a really interesting  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:34):**  design kind of like thinking about like how to diversify the the the hass monoculture  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:40):**  but and also like you know stack functions into that and then and make it into more of  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:46):**  like a food producing lush kind of a community so that was an interesting one it was in quite  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:52):**  a dry area where they get a lot of rain and rain season that was very joyful wet season  
**[0:36:56-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:36:56):**  so a lot of water capture and storage and all these things and it actually led directly  
**[0:37:04-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:37:04):**  into another to another project which is a family who have 2000 acres in the end and  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:37:13):**  they're very motivated to do huge amount of re-fire station but they didn't really realize  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:37:19):**  until I talked to them that they had a huge they had their family had a huge cattle ranching  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:37:25):**  operation on there for years and it's still there but it's the kind of typical the typical  
**[0:37:32-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:37:32):**  thing in the mix of like just no trees just grasslands and it's like hiding under the  
**[0:37:41-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:37:41):**  only piece of shade there is for five miles and you know so we started talking and I was  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:37:51):**  saying you know you could do like a really interesting syllable here as well as doing  
**[0:37:58-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:37:58):**  all the re-fire station and then I spot convinced somewhat we it was happening but we unity  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:38:08):**  right by them we decided we decided we're going to try and design systems where the  
**[0:38:13-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:38:13):**  community who have up until now been encroaching onto land and you know to plant corn that  
**[0:38:22-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:38:22):**  we're going to set up a whole sort of zone to food producing community kind of like agriculture  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:38:33):**  system which can again sell food to the to this family and they have plans to go into  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:38:40):**  kind of like the you know high-end organic food market so it's going to be I mean I really  
**[0:38:46-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:38:46):**  hope we can make it happen working on the design at the moment but it's incredibly exciting  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:38:54):**  to be able to design a two thousand acre five zone permaculture farm you know which is what  
**[0:38:59-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:38:59):**  this is going to be so exciting to like learn about all the tropical species that are there  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:05):**  because it is quite different I'm happy to I'm happy to research a lot on it because  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:09):**  you know we're in the same country and I'm only like maybe eight hours away it's a completely  
**[0:39:13-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:13):**  different yeah the deep jungle man but the species there is primary forest in there which  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:22):**  is great because the first thing I said I want to do was like go and so we spent two  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:27):**  days hiking in the primary growth forests there because the first thing I said was I  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:31):**  want to see what this place wants to look like if you know what I mean of course and  
**[0:39:38-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:38):**  so that's a privilege actually I think as a designer when you get to actually see that  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:45):**  and to have these trees do you remember jerry jerry come across them the chi and chico sapote  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:50):**  yeah yeah I remember that one you've got you've come across it I think I even heard about  
**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:39:55):**  it when I was in the area of Mexico too yeah it's like a famous one it's a super slow growing  
**[0:40:02-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:02):**  tropical hardwood and it like you can build houses in a river with them and they'll last  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:09):**  for a hundred years like they're crazy and and they're so beautiful so I have a bunch  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:16):**  of them on the you know like these grandmother grandfather trees like that and then these  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:23):**  all these other ones like Santa Maria and palo blanco oh my god like so many all these  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:30):**  different mahogany's so incredible to see that and that they have a kind of a light  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:35):**  a living seed bank there and I've been reading a lot of stuff on rotational grazing and how  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:43):**  to do it properly in the tropics you know like what species to put along the edges so  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:48):**  that you have like sort of the cattle have a diverse amount of far edge and you know  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:40:53):**  like yeah I just so um it's exciting for me I was you know very upfront with with with  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:41:00):**  them I said look this I can I have a very good idea of how broad strokes of this design  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:41:06):**  are going to look but I need to I need to do a lot of self-education if I'm going to  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:41:11):**  make it work so I think that's important to say that you know because we can't as permaculture  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:41:18):**  designers be you know every detail of every system I think it's like so yeah but I'm really  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:41:25):**  looking forward to it so if anyone has any resources that they really liked on kind of  
**[0:41:32-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:41:32):**  rotational grazing and silvopasture in the human tropics on all ears and yeah so that's  
**[0:41:41-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:41:41):**  exciting and there's other there's an other inch so to be honest a big part of the for  
**[0:41:49-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:41:49):**  me the last um sort of three years back when in the states uh tomorrow so I've been if  
**[0:42:05-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:05):**  it was just me I would be had to say no to a lot of work but I've sort of said yeah Jared's  
**[0:42:13-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:13):**  coming back but very stressful to like have to leave when Arianna has actually had some  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:22):**  kind of leaving a couple of different times there's just so much happening on the farm  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:27):**  it's hard but Jeremy's coming back hopefully able to dovetail that one another and also  
**[0:42:33-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:33):**  work together on the projects which is a big a link working in well that's good to hear  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:41):**  well look on that no look I'm sure we could talk about in detail so many of the other  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:45):**  things that you just kind of glossed over this time but let's plan on doing another  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:49):**  catch up before too long and before I let you go why don't you tell our listeners where  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:53):**  they can find more information about your projects and how they can reach out and possibly  
**[0:42:57-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:42:57):**  even come visit and help out yeah for sure well one issue was the courses at the town  
**[0:43:04-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:43:04):**  organics and we're just coming to the end of a pd cedar in conjunction with ema and  
**[0:43:13-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:43:13):**  we have plenty more like permaculture courses natural building there's a course that's specific  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:43:24):**  on food forest coming up there a good friend brock and and cat so there's plenty more on  
**[0:43:30-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:43:30):**  at organics forward slash horses or just going to at the down organics and then courses and  
**[0:43:38-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:43:38):**  then our approach you can find us it's a gang grand  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:43:48):**  has keen to your J a t z a i n has keen or grand has keen dot-com there and also some  
**[0:43:53-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:43:53):**  information which is called rejenera and there's a link to that on the on the page so hopefully  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:44:02):**  that we're gonna so we've got a videographer come to we're gonna start putting out some  
**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:44:08):**  online content and getting some videos up there so hopefully people who have more tangible  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:44:13):**  things to follow man that's great that's I mean it's so great to hear how much this place  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:44:20):**  has matured and is starting to really come into its own over time you guys are doing  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:44:24):**  fantastic work out there and I'm so glad that I was able to be a part of it in the beginning  
**[0:44:28-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-hegarty-2/#t=0:44:28):**  and see you guys just fly and take off with it since I've moved on but yeah let's definitely

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:00):**  So it was about five years ago, almost to the day, when I was working as an assistant  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:21):**  on a natural building project in Senegal.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:24):**  And after the day's work was done, we were starting to sort of decompress at the end  
**[0:00:30-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:30):**  of a long work day.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:31):**  Me and the students were kind of chatting, and we were making fun of accents.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:36):**  And of course, we had students from all over the world, and you know, and so we were talking  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:40):**  about European accents and American accents, and it became very clear to me just how much  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:44):**  everybody knew that I had a very standard American accent.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:48):**  Not too pronounced, nothing like a southern drawl or a characteristic New York accent,  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:53):**  for example.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:54):**  But I'll never forget, one of my favorite students was this girl named Lena, a very  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:00:59):**  timid little Austrian girl with a big hair of blonde dreadlocks and baggy work clothes  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:04):**  that she always wore to the work site.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:06):**  She didn't speak up a whole lot, but in this particular case, she looked straight at me  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:09):**  and said, Oliver, your voice sounds like a podcast.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:14):**  And a lot of us just kind of cracked up.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:16):**  I think a lot of them agreed.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:17):**  And that's really how this whole thing started.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:22):**  You're listening to Regenerative Skills.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:24):**  I'm Oliver Gautier, and the purpose of this show is to share actionable information about  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:29):**  how to live in a way that contributes to a regenerative future for everyone by highlighting  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:33):**  the people and projects that exemplify regenerative thinking and solutions.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:40):**  This is the very first episode of the first season, and after four years of hosting the  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:44):**  Abundant Edge podcast, I want this episode to set the tone for what's to come.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:48):**  Now, I learned a lot from more than 170 interviews and panel discussions from the last seasons  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:54):**  of the Abundant Edge podcast, but one of the most enduring lessons that I use and apply  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:01:59):**  every day is the importance of questions and the power that they have, not only in getting  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:04):**  information from others and keeping a conversation going, but in shaping the way that I think  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:09):**  and what I prioritize.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:11):**  So this first show is about how to ask better questions and how you can leverage them to  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:16):**  completely change your life in whatever way that you want.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:20):**  I'll be sharing some of my own observations, and I'll be speaking to two women who've inspired  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:23):**  me to stay curious and continue to audit my own thought process and conclusions along  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:29):**  the way.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:30):**  So be sure to stay tuned until the end, because in every episode of this new format, I'll  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:34):**  be breaking down the steps that you can apply in your own life today to move forward to  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:40):**  a regenerative future.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:43):**  So through the last four years of experimenting and learning with this show, I've also been  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:47):**  through a lot of personal challenges and growth, many of which have found their way into the  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:52):**  interviews themselves.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:53):**  I did an internship in bamboo building, I invested in a small farm in the mountains  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:02:58):**  of Lake Atilan in Guatemala in a small Mayan-Cachiquel village called Sunun√° with two of my closest  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:04):**  friends at the time.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:05):**  I later left that project to travel through southern Mexico, visiting regenerative projects  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:09):**  and making short videos.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:11):**  And then from there, after visiting my family in the States, I moved here to Spain, which  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:15):**  has been about a year and a half ago now.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:17):**  One of the most valuable things that I've learned over that time is just how much good  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:22):**  questions can do for my understanding.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:25):**  Questions have helped me to be a better listener and to listen more actively.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:28):**  They've shaken my belief systems and my assumptions.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:31):**  They've helped me to observe closer and change the focus of my searches.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:36):**  And all of these things have made me better at my work as a designer and a consultant  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:40):**  for regenerative projects too.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:42):**  I mean, before I focused on asking better questions, I had a tendency to rush towards  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:46):**  solutions without fully understanding problems.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:49):**  But in the last few years, I've found that the right questions can give me a chance to  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:53):**  pause and make sure that I'm focused on the root of what I'm struggling with.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:03:58):**  Sometimes the goal isn't actually to answer the question itself, but to find out something  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:02):**  new or interesting in the process of investigation.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:06):**  Questions like, what is the meaning of life, for example, isn't a question that is often  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:11):**  meant to be answered matter-of-factly.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:13):**  It's personal and evolving.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:15):**  It opens up exploration of priorities and beliefs, teachings from your childhood, moral  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:21):**  quandaries, and struggles for self-improvement.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:25):**  The best thing about this show is that I've gotten to try out these new questions and  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:29):**  ideas of how to better inquire about the world around me and from people who I respect and  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:35):**  who I've learned from directly.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:37):**  So after four years of working on this podcast and interviewing some of my favorite and most  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:41):**  inspiring people, let me break down seven of the ways that I've learned to ask or  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:47):**  craft better questions and to get the most mileage out of them.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:51):**  So number one, even a bad question is better than the perfect one that you never ask.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:04:57):**  Getting used to asking questions and getting over the fear of how you'll be perceived  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:00):**  if you ask a dumb question is really important.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:03):**  Sometimes questions that seem dumb are actually the ones that cause us to think more deeply  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:08):**  about our very basic assumptions.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:10):**  Number two, know what you're hoping to learn first and then craft questions around that  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:15):**  end goal.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:16):**  So, for example, if I wanted to understand why a natural builder would choose Adobe walls  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:20):**  over say, Cobb, I could ask, why did you choose Adobe over Cobb and of course get a clear  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:27):**  answer.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:28):**  Or I could ask, how do you evaluate and determine what materials to use on a build and that  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:33):**  way I could learn to analyze all of the materials through their selection method.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:39):**  Number three, a good way to show the person that you're talking to that you've actually  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:43):**  been listening to them is to preface your question with a reference to something that  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:47):**  your subject said previously or that you know about them from before.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:52):**  So for example, you mentioned earlier that you were inspired to grow your own food when  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:56):**  you had a serious health scare.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:05:58):**  How has growing veggies benefited your life beyond your physical health?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:02):**  You see what I did there, I referenced back to what they had said before and used that  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:07):**  to help them expand around a concept that we can then explore further.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:11):**  Number four, avoid compound questions and keep it brief.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:16):**  Now I say this one because I'm personally really bad at it and it's something that I  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:20):**  need to work on.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:21):**  I've even had people comment on the shows telling me that I need to stick to just one  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:25):**  question at a time.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:26):**  The thing is I just get so excited to learn from people that I try to ask things all at  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:30):**  once and then get a confused response when they don't know how to answer first and then  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:36):**  of course they forget the second part of the question later.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:39):**  So instead keep questions clear and singular and have some faith that they'll stick around  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:43):**  to answer some follow-up questions.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:46):**  Number five, take the time to build rapport with people before asking deep or potentially  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:52):**  uncomfortable questions.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:54):**  Especially when you're digging into personal and sensitive experiences, it's just as important  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:06:58):**  to establish trust and comfort with the other person as it is to ask the right questions.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:04):**  I've found for myself that the best questions in the world won't get a deep or heartfelt  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:08):**  response if the other person doesn't feel safe revealing their feelings to you.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:13):**  Often empathizing with their situation or expressing how you've been through something  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:18):**  similar or sometimes even just acknowledging that what they've been through is hard or  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:22):**  embarrassing and that you have no reference to how it would feel can help to set somebody  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:27):**  else at ease.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:30):**  Number six, asking questions can be a more effective way of teaching than just giving  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:35):**  students the answers.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:37):**  I've learned this one recently.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:38):**  Actually one of my students from the Ecosystem Restoration Design course asked me what the  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:43):**  best trees to plant on their degraded land should be during one of the Q&A calls the  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:48):**  other week.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:49):**  Now, even though I had lots of ideas of what could work for them, I tried to hold back  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:54):**  and to ask them how they would go about making that choice for themselves.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:07:59):**  What factors would they need to consider?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:01):**  Things like their climate, their personal restoration goals, and even their personal  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:05):**  tastes let's say if they wanted fruit trees.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:08):**  The truth is that the best answers for questions, especially about advice, almost always come  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:13):**  from the person who are asking them anyway.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:15):**  So I try to look for counter questions that help them to make their own choices.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:20):**  Number seven, this last bit of insight that I've learned is that sometimes the best question  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:25):**  is silence.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:30):**  Especially if it leads the other person to elaborate or justify their answer beyond what  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:34):**  they expected to share.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:36):**  This works a lot better in person where body language and uncomfortable silences can leverage  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:41):**  the tension.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:42):**  On internet calls they might just ask if you're still there.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:45):**  Jill, are you there?  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:48):**  Okay, hold on.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:49):**  For some reason my recorder said it's not initializing.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:51):**  Hold on one sec.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:53):**  One of the people that I've most admired in the podcasting scene is Jill Cloutier, host  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:08:58):**  of Sustainable World Radio, one of the longest running and most successful shows on sustainable  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:02):**  living and a reconnection with nature still running.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:05):**  Jill is a radio producer, video maker, environmental educator, writer, and PR director of an environmental  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:10):**  education and arts nonprofit.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:13):**  And on top of that she's just a fantastic interviewer.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:15):**  And so I caught up with her to ask her about some of the ways that she goes beyond just  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:19):**  gathering information in the interviews to really connect with the people that she's  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:23):**  talking to.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:24):**  What I've found to be the most important part of interviewing people is to create space.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:30):**  And so it's really to ask a question and not a yes or no question, right?  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:35):**  We know that as interviewers, and then just wait and create and be present is super, super  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:41):**  important.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:42):**  And then just wait and allow kind of the person story to unspool.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:47):**  And I think if you create that space, treasures come forward.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:50):**  And then I ask questions based on that little personal things that really struck me.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:55):**  I will ask questions about that.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:09:58):**  I remember asking Darren Dougherty in the first interview I did with him about his grandmother's  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:03):**  arms that smelled like soap, I think it was because she made soap, I think.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:10):**  And so I like kind of focusing on personal things.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:13):**  And I always try even though the topics can be very, very serious.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:16):**  I always try and bring some humor in to I think humor is a great way to deliver sober  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:22):**  messages.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:23):**  There's also some aspects of asking good questions that you just can't prepare for or even fake.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:28):**  I think curiosity is the most important thing getting back to the questions as well.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:33):**  Because I'm truly curious about what people their stories like the story behind what the  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:38):**  stories.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:39):**  And so I think that when you are that type of person, people just spill their guts to  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:43):**  you.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:44):**  Have you had that experience?  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:45):**  Like, even at gas stations?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:47):**  I mean, before COVID, I would have people telling me their life stories.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:51):**  And Kevin's like, I just said, Oh, that man's wife just this was years ago, that man's wife  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:55):**  just passed away.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:56):**  But his brother's coming into town.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:57):**  He's like, how did you learn that?  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:10:59):**  I'm like, Oh, in, you know, in line, whatever.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:02):**  So it's interesting.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:03):**  I think it's creating that space to be a listener is really the greatest gift we can give others.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:09):**  It seems like we're at a time in our culture where genuine listening is surprisingly rare.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:16):**  And when you find yourself in a situation where you feel listened to, it invites you  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:21):**  to explore aspects of yourself and your thought process that you're not given license to most  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:27):**  of the time.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:28):**  Do you find that as well?  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:29):**  Oh, oh, my gosh, I have.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:32):**  I have one friend.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:33):**  Well, I have many friends, but I have one dear friend that when I'm with her, I talk  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:39):**  so much.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:40):**  And I realize from her presence, and I'm like, Oh, my gosh, here I am, talk telling you this  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:44):**  story.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:45):**  And she said, Oh, no, that's okay.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:47):**  You know, and I think I'm the listening role often with my other group of friends.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:52):**  And when I leave being with her, and then I always turn around and say, Okay, now it's  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:56):**  time to talk about you.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:11:58):**  But to have that gift of her being present and interested in asking questions.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:03):**  It just, it's kind of it gives me this high uplifted feeling, which I'm sure you've experienced  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:08):**  as well.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:09):**  It's like, Oh, my gosh, someone sees me and hears me and is interested.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:13):**  Wow.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:14):**  It's great.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:15):**  Now, look, I love all of these insights on the power of questions and what it takes to  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:18):**  be a good listener and invite others to speak from the heart.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:22):**  But these could work for anything.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:23):**  Now since this is regenerative skills, after all, and because this episode is going to  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:27):**  set the tone for the whole season, I've got to figure out what questions can open up my  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:31):**  way of seeing the world and my role in it.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:34):**  So I can be a steward of my environment and facilitate the process of regeneration in  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:38):**  this time and culture globally, when it's in need of better narratives and inspiring  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:42):**  potential.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:43):**  So what am I even talking about when I say regenerative?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:48):**  Regeneration is a concept which is ancient.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:51):**  It is not the next thing to sustainability.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:12:56):**  It has been in indigenous cultures, if they haven't been colonized too much for millennia.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:04):**  This is Carol Sanford, one of the most recognized thought leaders in the regeneration movement,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:09):**  whose award winning books, university courses and study communities have been pioneering  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:13):**  frameworks for business leadership and human development for four decades.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:17):**  I had started by asking her what the mainstream regenerative movement is still getting wrong  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:22):**  as a way of opening up an analysis of what the concept of regeneration really is.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:27):**  But Carol immediately reframed the answer to break down how we have to understand the  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:30):**  world before we can even start to think about regeneration.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:35):**  Image you first have to get in your mind is of a whole.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:39):**  Most of us work with parts, pieces, issues, causes, something that would answer your first  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:46):**  question about what are people getting wrong, where are things in holes not working, where  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:50):**  are things in an H-O-L-E, not a W-H-O-L-E.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:57):**  And so you have to start with a hole in mind.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:13:59):**  So either pick a child, if you have a child in your life, or pick a life shed, my term  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:09):**  for watershed, because we can talk about that some of the time, a city, an organization  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:16):**  that you work with, which is a hole in and of itself, like a corporation or a not for  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:21):**  profit.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:22):**  Once you've got that, now I can give you my six words.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:28):**  If I want to be regenerative with that entity and help it be regenerative in its life, the  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:34):**  first thing I must have in my mind is how to evolve its capacity.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:41):**  Because all children, all cities, all corporations have aspiration.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:50):**  They may have missions and visions and strategies, but they don't have capacity.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:14:56):**  If you have that, now your work is to evolve their capacity to carry that out.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:02):**  And normally what we think of is more like sustainability.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:08):**  What you want to do is stop the damage of something and get it back to where it was,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:13):**  resilience restoration.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:16):**  So that's the first big shift from the way people are misusing the term regeneration,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:23):**  is it's not about getting something back to or getting people out of the way of so they  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:27):**  don't damage earth, which is another hole we could think about.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:32):**  It is about evolving the capacity of this life shed to do its work.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:37):**  The second set of two words, so evolved capacity for essence expression.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:45):**  So this hole that we have in mind, this picture we have in mind of a child or a city or a  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:50):**  life shed or a planet, we have to know that there are no duplicates in there.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:15:56):**  Each child has an essence, each life shed does.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:00):**  There's no common set of things at a level of being.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:04):**  There may be the child has two arms and legs, but they may not.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:10):**  What they have is something that is very deep in them that is not duplicated.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:15):**  You can't even do it by comparison and say they're different than that.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:19):**  Your work is to not do things for them or sell them things, but evolve their capacity  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:23):**  to go after what they want and express their essence in doing that.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:28):**  And now I have the last two words.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:30):**  So we're going to evolve capacity for essence expression via system actualization.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:38):**  If you're in regeneration, you're doing a nested system actualization.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:44):**  You want not just the city, but the watershed it's in and the region it's in and the planet  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:50):**  it's on all to be actualized.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:16:55):**  And you have to come to understand how to do living systems thinking, not dynamics system  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:00):**  thinking.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:01):**  With this expanded framework of what needs to be identified and understood before we  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:05):**  can start taking regenerative actions, I wanted to know what questions I could use to focus  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:09):**  my thinking around this concept.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:11):**  And luckily Carol has seven questions to do just that.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:15):**  All right, so regeneration is less about doing directly.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:21):**  And that's the other error that people make is it works from that which is hidden, that  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:27):**  which is implicate.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:29):**  So I'm going to give you seven questions.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:31):**  And as you said, just where we started here, the question is where the juice is.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:36):**  Do you know how to define the whole as nature defines it?  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:41):**  So a river is not a whole.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:44):**  It is also not a part.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:49):**  Because there are no parts in life there in living systems, there are no parts.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:17:54):**  So you can actually work regeneratively on rivers, you would be working very likely on  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:00):**  a resting disorder, the cleaning them up, making sure wildlife gets taken care of, but  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:07):**  you wouldn't actually work on the essence of that particular watershed.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:10):**  Do you know how to conceive of a whole before you do anything?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:15):**  Because if not, you're now completely off on the wrong foot.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:19):**  The second question is, do you know how and how would you go about understanding the essence  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:27):**  of that whole?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:28):**  I did a lot of work years ago in psychology, and did family therapy, I mean, literally  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:35):**  50 years ago.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:37):**  And what I did is work with parents to learn to connect with the essence of each child,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:42):**  not say be like your brother, your dad's a role model, go like him or meet all the standards  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:49):**  of what we ought to do.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:51):**  And we can classify you as hype, you know, gifted or put you in some category.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:18:58):**  How do you let go of the categorizing and look at this child, this life shed this city  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:06):**  or what it is?  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:08):**  The third one is about potential.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:12):**  Because we tend to work so much from problems.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:15):**  And even your opening question to me, what did they get wrong is a problem question,  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:20):**  right?  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:21):**  It's from a paradigm that's not a regenerative question.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:25):**  It's learning how to see not ideals, but see holes with an essence that therefore our potential  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:35):**  is our third arena.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:36):**  Now, there are many questions you could ask.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:39):**  What I would be asking is, notice myself, am I working on problems?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:44):**  Or am I working for this specific unique entity on its potential?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:49):**  Because problems will always be generic.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:52):**  They'll always be some lump categorizing that we've created.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:19:56):**  And now we got to have a bunch of experts to tell us what fits in there and what the  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:00):**  perfect ideal practice is.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:03):**  The fourth first principle is all of living systems have a hole that hasn't, they are  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:10):**  a hole.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:12):**  We have to define that it has an essence that is really pursuing potential.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:17):**  Think of this child.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:19):**  And there has to be development for that to happen because we're not born ready to do  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:25):**  all the stuff that we need to do to carry out our essence.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:29):**  I mean, we know we can't walk and roll over and that kind of stuff, but we also don't  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:33):**  have inner capability to manage myself.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:36):**  A two-year-old goes crazy, rolls tantrums.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:40):**  I mean, if we see an adult doing that, we'd say, hmm, not very well developed.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:45):**  What development is needed?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:47):**  Not based on problems, but based on potential.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:50):**  So I've got a framework that holds all of these together.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:20:54):**  So I never ask development without asking what's the hole and a specific concrete hole  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:01):**  that has an essence.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:04):**  And then given what it's seeking to do in the world, what is the potential that needs  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:09):**  to be built that they want to build up me, me impose it, not me assess it, me support  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:15):**  what they're trying to.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:17):**  And now how do we build development for that development?  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:20):**  When the fourth one is like a bridge between the inner work we have to do and the outer  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:26):**  world we want to manifest it in.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:28):**  What I'm working on is shifting to a different paradigm from which to ask questions.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:34):**  What's the evolutionary process it's on?  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:38):**  What is it that the work I do could fit in and how do I have to grow me?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:42):**  Those are the kinds of questions that I like to start with.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:47):**  And those are exactly the kind of questions that I'm going to be challenging myself and  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:51):**  my guests to answer in the episodes to come.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:54):**  Now I especially get fired up about this concept of developing potential.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:21:59):**  Developing my own, that of my relationships, and of the people in my life, and the potential  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:04):**  of this show to tell important stories, offer educational insights of how others are achieving  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:09):**  regenerative progress in their worlds, and the potential to include others in this journey  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:14):**  who may never have thought they could regain control of their futures and contribute to  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:18):**  a better and fairer world for everyone.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:21):**  This is exactly the potential that I need your help to develop and this is why there  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:24):**  will be so many more ways of taking part in the community around this show than in previous  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:29):**  seasons.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:30):**  For starters, if you're as tired as I am of the noise and negativity of most social media  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:35):**  platforms, you can join the Regenerative Skills discussion forum on Discord through the link  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:40):**  in the website where you can share your stories, projects, and questions with me and the other  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:44):**  listeners where we'll be working together to help each other with our challenges and  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:48):**  celebrate our wins together.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:51):**  That's also where you can reach me directly if you want to share your story or have your  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:54):**  questions answered on this show.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:22:57):**  Now for those of you who are really motivated to upgrade your life and your projects, the  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:01):**  new subscription packages that I've just opened up through Patreon will give you access to  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:05):**  all the full, unedited interviews from each episode, note packets to review all of the  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:10):**  essential information and steps, and exclusive links to panel discussions and calls with  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:15):**  the experts that I'll be hosting each month.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:18):**  I'll even be offering regular book giveaways and other prizes through these subscriptions  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:22):**  throughout the season.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:24):**  Starting today, I even have 5 spots open for personalized consulting where you'll get all  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:29):**  of the benefits that I just mentioned as well as one-on-one calls with me where we'll work  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:34):**  to guide you through designing your own project from essential information and context understanding,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:40):**  through ecological and community project or business design, and up through implementation,  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:46):**  team assembly, and goal achievement.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:48):**  Now though I'll be managing the subscriptions through Patreon, I will never ask for donations.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:53):**  Every subscription level comes with resources and links for those of you who are looking  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:23:57):**  to take leaps forward in your regenerative journey.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:00):**  The podcast itself is supported by companies and organizations that believe in the integrity  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:05):**  of our message and that I've vetted for the integrity of theirs as well as the quality  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:09):**  of their products and services and that I'm proud to be associated with.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:13):**  The biggest difference between this show and so many others that are looking to scale and  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:17):**  build movements and global change is that I want to focus on the quality of connection  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:22):**  and relationships with those of you who come back each week to explore and grow with me.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:28):**  So I won't be urging you to share hashtags and blast this all over the internet with  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:32):**  some slim hope of cutting through the noise and the clutter that's already out there.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:36):**  Instead, if you enjoy these topics, ideas, and conversations, I hope that you'll have  
**[0:24:41-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-ask-better-questions/#t=0:24:41):**  more of your own.

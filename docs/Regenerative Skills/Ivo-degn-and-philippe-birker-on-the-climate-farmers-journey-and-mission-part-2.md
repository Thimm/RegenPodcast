**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:01:36):**  the transition to a regenerative agriculture future in Europe.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:01:40):**  We talked about our own strategy of focusing on direct support for farmers through the  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:01:43):**  different projects and departments within the organization, from the ever-growing academy  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:01:48):**  making quality educational resources easy to find, to the remote sensing team helping  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:01:52):**  to gather data and metrics on the improvement of the soil and other ecosystem services as

**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:00):**  Now to wrap up the conversation today, we're going to go back into the beginning and recap  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:05):**  the crazy turn of events that got us to where we are less than a year from launching.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:10):**  You'll get to hear about how this small agtech startup has gone from a loose idea to attracting  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:15):**  collaboration and support from industries and farmers alike.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:19):**  The journey is certainly not over, in fact, the really challenging parts are still ahead.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:24):**  So if you haven't yet heard the first part of this interview, I'll encourage you to go  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:27):**  back and have a listen because it'll give you more context to the wild story that's  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:30):**  about to come.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:31):**  I'll wait.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:32):**  No, I'm just kidding.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:35):**  So let's check back in with Ivo Degen and Philip Berker to see how this all started.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:40):**  So let's step back a little bit and kind of give people an idea of the story of how we've  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:46):**  gotten to where we are because like I mentioned in the beginning, this has been a short and  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:50):**  very intense journey.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:52):**  I first heard from Ivo, what it's been a little over two years ago because I remember I was  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:02:58):**  still in Guatemala when we first chatted and we were kind of loosely in touch.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:04):**  You mentioned that you had like a conversation with me where I gave you some indicators or  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:08):**  ideas about where regenerative ag is going.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:11):**  Can you remind me of that?  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:12):**  Because I remember the conversation, but I have no idea what I told you.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:16):**  Yeah, I actually have it here.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:17):**  I actually have the notes here.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:18):**  Let's see.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:20):**  And so this is a, this is a, oh, wait, I don't know if I find the note.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:26):**  Oh yes, here it is.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:28):**  So the three bottlenecks to starting a regenerative business, according to Oliver Gaucher on the  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:35):**  4th of March, 2020 at 9.13 in the morning.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:38):**  This is a level of organization that I highly envy and I'm very now scared as to what is  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:43):**  going to come out of these notes.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:45):**  Actually, it's pretty much what we do, I think.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:48):**  So there's a cashflow problem from input to output, right?  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:51):**  So in the beginning of the season, you input a lot and don't get the output until the end.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:03:57):**  So we have a cashflow problem.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:01):**  Large steps usually, so no ability to move and make changes.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:06):**  A balance between efficiency and diversity.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:08):**  I think that's a really interesting one.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:10):**  So the more diverse it gets, the less efficient it gets.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:15):**  And I think this is something that the large scale regenerative agriculture so slowly is  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:20):**  coming to terms with and find a solution for.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:24):**  And what you said back then is there are solutions out there to learn it, but not everybody knows  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:28):**  how to find them.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:30):**  Actually, yeah.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:32):**  That's what we do now.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:35):**  And access is not the big problem, but matching it to your context is.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:39):**  Again, very much what we're doing today.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:44):**  Then we had a discussion about profitable farming and that there's still a lack of work  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:52):**  about that.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:55):**  And bringing it to market.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:04:56):**  I think that was the time when you were working and I think you're still involved with that  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:01):**  with your coffee cooperative in Guatemala.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:05):**  So that was really interesting to hear about.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:08):**  So yeah, we talked about that.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:10):**  And I think in the same way, we had these discussions and we also had discussions with  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:16):**  a lot of different experts on the topic.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:19):**  And I think this is just very visible that these are the things that come up again and  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:24):**  again that need to be solved.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:26):**  We need to find good ways of financing that transition and we need to find ways to bring  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:33):**  context specific knowledge to the people in the way and in the moment that they needed.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:39):**  Yeah, the fortunate thing is that since that conversation and partly through a lot of the  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:43):**  work that I'm doing with you guys is getting to know consultants and different examples  
**[0:05:48-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:48):**  around.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:49):**  The context thing has mostly been solved even though the access thing is still a problem.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:05:53):**  So there are examples of fantastic regenerative farms or consultants who can give very accurate  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:06:00):**  and knowledgeable advice.

**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:06:12):**  honestly, in preparing for the Pioneer program.

**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:06:39):**  of the trends or the patterns in how this is being implemented, the scale and where  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:06:46):**  that bottleneck is in access or in visibility?  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:06:52):**  I think one of the interesting patterns that we've been seeing is the people that are getting  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:06:56):**  into regenerative agriculture and the farmers which are getting into it, which is usually  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:02):**  either people that have a bit of a midlife crisis or so.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:06):**  So they have some kind of breaking point in life where they're realizing, what am I actually  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:12):**  doing with my life?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:13):**  And then they kind of start tumbling into this whole World Wide Web.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:17):**  And luckily, somehow they end up on the right YouTube platforms and they do end up somehow  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:21):**  going down the rabbit hole of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:24):**  And this is a lot of times the people that are starting market gardenings because it's  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:28):**  very easy to start.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:29):**  You don't need a lot of land.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:30):**  You don't need a lot of financial input.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:32):**  And there's a great movement happening around that one.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:36):**  The second part, which is really curious group as well, is kind of the children of farmers  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:42):**  of several generations who after growing up were kind of, okay, screw this.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:47):**  I want to get out in the city.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:48):**  I want to get away from this farm.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:50):**  And they go in the city, they study, they do something else.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:53):**  And then they also realize, this is not really where I find fulfillment in life as well.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:07:59):**  And they decide to go back to the farm and to take over the parent's farm under the condition  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:03):**  that they can start applying regenerative agriculture practices.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:06):**  And this is then also the big farms that we're talking about.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:08):**  So this is people who are taking over functioning farms and transitioning to region X.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:13):**  And then a third group that we're seeing that is also really pushing it forward is women  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:17):**  in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:18):**  But there also seems to be a larger percentage than a normal agriculture, which is still  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:22):**  something we're trying to figure out what the reason for that is.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:25):**  But this is kind of the three driving forces in terms of people behind region X that we  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:30):**  are seeing.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:31):**  And I think it's really nice that what is happening is that people who would otherwise  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:35):**  not have picked up agriculture are picking up regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:40):**  Because I think this is really something that we need and that plays in with appreciation  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:44):**  in society.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:45):**  So for me, I get a lot of excitement out of it.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:47):**  Every time I hear a young person, I hear something that wants to do region X and that wants to  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:51):**  go back to farming.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:52):**  I think what we need is more people that say, hey, it's cool to be a farmer.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:57):**  I want to be a farmer.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:08:58):**  And this is where we really want to try to play a role with climate farmers as well,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:02):**  who's making it possible for the people that wanted to region X to do it.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:06):**  And this is also, I think, the open call that I would definitely do through this podcast.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:09):**  If you are thinking about getting into regenerative agriculture and you don't know how to drop  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:13):**  us a line, and we will do our best to help you to do so.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:16):**  And what's been interesting is that all of those observations have meshed with other  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:20):**  people that have helped to mentor us in the formation of how we're approaching these.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:24):**  I remember having a specific conversation with John Kemp from the Regenerative Agriculture  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:29):**  podcast AEA in the United States, who basically told us those exact same things that mesh  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:34):**  with your experiences on the road and your contacts.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:38):**  It's interesting that this is not just applicable to Europe, but this is very similar in other  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:43):**  parts of the world as well.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:46):**  And so let's keep going with this story now.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:48):**  So as this concept of creating a company around climate farmers came about, I remember having  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:09:54):**  some very early calls with Ivo about how some first steps were going to be made.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:00):**  Which one of you wants to tell how that evolved from those early calls to, let's say, the  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:06):**  first launch of the expert panel call that we did that was kind of the beginning?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:12):**  In the end, it's a story of people, right?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:15):**  So I think the nice thing is that both me and Ivo, we had the pleasure of having worked  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:20):**  with amazing people already in our past and having had a lot of people that crossed it.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:24):**  And what was amazing to me was, of course, I mean, this was all that I was doing for  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:29):**  the last two, three years.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:30):**  And this was all that I was talking about.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:32):**  So obviously a lot of my friends had to listen to me ranting about agriculture and regenerative  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:38):**  agriculture.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:39):**  And what was really surprising was a lot of them were like, how can I get involved?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:44):**  And then usually my reply was like, well, we need help, but we have no money.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:49):**  I can't really give you anything.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:51):**  I can spend time with you and I can help you, but I can't really pay you.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:55):**  And people were like, Philipp is a great salesperson.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:10:59):**  Amazing.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:00):**  Like next level.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:01):**  And people were generally like, yeah, that sounds great.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:04):**  A lot of work and no pay.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:06):**  I love it.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:07):**  Where can I sign?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:08):**  So I mean, Nick is a very dear friend of mine since 10 years and he's been involved in permaculture  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:15):**  and knowing a lot about plants, about hydration, about a lot of the different topics.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:20):**  And he was one of the first people that joined and he's now the head of our academy.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:24):**  The same goes for Fabio who's building up our incredible open source community, who  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:27):**  just happened to be with me in Portugal when we started and who saw what me and Eva were

**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:33):**  And the same with Ben who's our CFO.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:35):**  And then we have Melina who's the sister of the very good friend of mine.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:39):**  And where we had this accelerator program in September in a countryside in Eastern Germany  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:43):**  called lab for land, where we got together at an old farmhouse to work out on this idea.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:48):**  And at the end of it, we needed to do a pitch and we had, we didn't, none of us have any  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:52):**  design skills or any taste of design.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:54):**  So Melina saw what we were doing and she was like, let me help you boys.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:11:58):**  And then Melina basically created this incredible presentation within 24 hours next to her normal  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:03):**  job.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:04):**  And since then she basically has been pushing out design after design and creating incredibly  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:09):**  beautiful stuff.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:10):**  And now after one year, we're finally able to give her a contract basically starting  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:16):**  on the 1st of August.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:17):**  And the same as with Gio, a friend of mine who for some reason has a passion for farmers  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:21):**  and was visiting farmers in South America and taking pictures of them.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:25):**  She is developing the profiles together with us.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:27):**  And well, there's a total of 20 people who have been working with us and climate farmers.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:31):**  And I think the important thing to say is, yeah, me and Ivo, we did very little, but  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:36):**  all these people, they did a lot.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:38):**  And this goes with you as well.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:41):**  Thanks to you, our first event when we were launching, we had Richard Perkins sitting  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:45):**  in that event and we had Patrick Bohm sitting there and it was like, who are these people  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:49):**  and how did they get these people in there?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:51):**  So yeah, somehow I think climate farmers is a very good example of what a lot of passionate  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:12:57):**  people can do with very little money, but with a lot of passion and a lot of desire.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:02):**  And this is where we are right now.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:04):**  And I'm thankful every morning when I'm waking up about being able to work with the people  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:08):**  that I have the pleasure of working with.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:11):**  And I think like for me, from the beginning, I was very convinced about the incredible  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:19):**  potential in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:22):**  I was convinced that with this huge potential, we could probably make it work in some way  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:29):**  financially.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:30):**  We could probably raise some money to work on this, but I was sure that we would never  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:38):**  find people to work with because who is going to get into agriculture?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:43):**  You could work on startup stuff and tech and you could work on activism and art and I don't  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:51):**  know what, right?  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:53):**  But people that have a level of experience are not going to get into agriculture.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:13:59):**  And it was so exciting, it was so interesting to see how many extremely smart, dedicated,  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:07):**  committed people were like, this is amazing, I want to be part of this.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:13):**  And just a couple of weeks ago, we had our first team retreat, this whole team came together  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:18):**  during corona time.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:20):**  So we were all remote.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:22):**  So most of us hadn't really met before a couple of weeks ago.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:29):**  And to be in our first team retreat and having these 20 people in a circle and looking at  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:36):**  it like, wow, wow.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:38):**  It's incredible to see how much this topic motivates, brings people together and how  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:44):**  much hope people have in not only our team.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:48):**  There's a whole ecosystem, a whole network that has developed around regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:14:54):**  So this makes me very, very hopeful and very, very motivated that this very, very niche  
**[0:15:04-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:04):**  topic until recently might actually, we have set ourselves this crazy North star metric  
**[0:15:14-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:14):**  that within the next couple of years, 10% of agriculture, yes, next three years, I didn't  
**[0:15:22-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:22):**  want to mention, okay, within the next three years, we're going to have 10% of Europe's  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:30):**  farmland under regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:34):**  And this seems like a crazy, ambitious goal.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:38):**  And at the same time, you see what is happening there.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:41):**  If we do this well, if we make sure that the commitments that are made by the industry,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:48):**  by the public sector are actually funneled into what we can all agree on is regenerative  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:15:57):**  agriculture, all of this podcast can agree on this regenerative agriculture, then we  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:04):**  have that potential.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:05):**  So to think that we might do this within a couple of years, wow, that is incredibly motivating.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:12):**  Yeah, it was really only through this incredible team, like you guys just finished talking  
**[0:16:18-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:18):**  about, have I started to see that there is an achievable roadmap to something that ambitious.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:26):**  And it really takes everybody's contributions and everybody's expertise to do this.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:30):**  And of course, Phil's incredible sales pitch of lots of work with for no pay.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:36):**  And I mean, it really has come together under some very strange circumstances.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:41):**  Like you mentioned, this happened during Corona times, we were all working remotely until  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:45):**  very recently went well, most of us are still working remotely until we got together for  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:49):**  the team retreat just a couple of weeks ago.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:16:52):**  And that has been a struggle in the communication side, in the networking side and in the coordination  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:00):**  of this.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:01):**  But I don't know, there's this sort of intangible thing that is motivating all of us to work  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:06):**  towards this together, partly because we're all invested in continuing to live in a nice  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:11):**  ecosystem here in Europe and seeing our communities and the ecology that we depend on thrive.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:18):**  But beyond that, there's real friendship, there's great connections on multiple levels  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:25):**  of not just what we're doing as a company and the results of our work, but also sharing  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:30):**  ideas and companionship and having a good time together.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:34):**  Oh, what are you doing in your workout routines?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:36):**  I love the artwork that you create.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:39):**  And this is creating an ecosystem of its own that, I mean, it's bigger than the sum of  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:43):**  its parts is kind of what I'm getting to.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:45):**  And it's been really wonderful to be a part of up until now.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:48):**  I'm really excited on all the places that this is going in the future.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:52):**  And you mentioned Nick, we're going to start to have a regular segment with him.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:17:56):**  We're going to start to reinvigorate the regenerative roundtable and get other members on here to  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:18:00):**  talk about what aspects of this mission that they're working on.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:18:04):**  But instead of going into that now, that's the time for another episode.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:18:07):**  Why don't you guys tell us how people can support the work that we're doing and how  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:18:11):**  they can get in touch?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:18:13):**  Philip?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission-part-2/#t=0:18:14):**  Yeah, I mean, there's lots of ways.

**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this episode of the abundant edge the podcast all about the worlds of natural building permaculture and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:07):**  Stay tuned at the end of this podcast for exclusive information on workshops and other educational opportunities  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:14):**  With me Oliver Goshay and abundant edge as always. I'm your host Oliver Goshay  
**[0:00:19-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:19):**  I have a fantastic guest with tons of information to get to so let's jump right on in  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:33):**  In this episode I had the pleasure of speaking to one of the foremost authorities on earth and flooring  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:39):**  Her name is Sakita Ray Krimel. She's the founder of both from these hands LLC and  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:45):**  Klalyn LLC which offers ready-made earth and floor products  
**[0:00:49-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:49):**  Sakita graduated from the University of Oregon with a bachelor's of science in environmental studies and a minor in architecture  
**[0:00:57-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:00:57):**  She later attended natural building workshops in Eugene, Oregon, which got her started in earth and materials from there  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:04):**  She began working in Portland with schools children homeowners general contractors and the larger community  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:10):**  Sakita also co-wrote the book earth and floors a modern approach to an ancient practice  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:16):**  Which is a technical guide for creating installing and maintaining your own earth and floors in this interview  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:22):**  We talked about the anatomy of earth and floors things. She's learned over years from installing floors in all kinds of settings  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:29):**  Maintenance and care and much more so without any more messing around here's Sakita  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:34):**  Thank you so much for joining me today Sakita. It's a pleasure to have you here. Thank you  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:40):**  He said it's been kind of a rainy season  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:44):**  Unusually rainy season in Portland this year. How is that affecting your jobs?  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:52):**  Mostly finish work  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:01:58):**  That's nice, all right  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:00):**  Well, hey, we got a whole bunch of stuff to get into so how about I just jump right into the first question  
**[0:02:06-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:06):**  All right  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:06):**  So you're best known for the beautiful and high quality earth and floors that you install and the products that your company  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:13):**  Klalyn sells for DIY floor makers  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:15):**  How did you first learn how to pour earth and floors and can you explain the steps and anatomy for us?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:23):**  Well, what I first learned isn't necessarily what I do now, but I first was a part of an earth and floor  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:29):**  in  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:30):**  Eugene Oregon in  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:32):**  1999 I believe or 2000 somewhere in that time period I  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:36):**  was working for a builder and he  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:39):**  had learned earth and floors  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:41):**  For some degree from this villain Athena steam and we did a floor  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:46):**  In a structure in Eugene and it was just a light bulb muddy wet day in the middle of December  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:52):**  But I didn't know anything besides I was just helping out. I  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:02:55):**  I continued to just do natural building and brought myself into Portland and  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:01):**  Wanted to bring natural building into the urban  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:04):**  Environment and so floors and flasters were a way to bring those materials  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:10):**  You know not all structure but some part of natural building into existing or just other types of structures than  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:18):**  copper, straw baled structures and  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:21):**  I did a lot of plaster and I also  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:24):**  saw  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:25):**  that earth and floors weren't being  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:28):**  developed in a way that plaster had already been developed in this  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:34):**  Modern era of the say and so I just started doing earth and floors more  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:40):**  So that's a little a history you asked for the anatomy of it  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:45):**  Meaning the structure of like what it's made up of it. So to me sure in the different layers  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:49):**  Yeah, so the way I approach earth and floors that I created it's a finish code  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:56):**  I do a three-quarter inch finish and  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:03:58):**  That earth and floor that three-quarter inch that could be laid on top of  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:03):**  sub floors of various types  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:05):**  So I'll just say briefly that the sub floor can be a concrete slab  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:10):**  It could be a plywood frame structure. It's two by six is a plywood or something or it can be  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:17):**  creating  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:20):**  Your own slab with no concrete like gravel  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:23):**  Insulation and we could get into the details of that but the specifics of that three-quarter inch finish  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:29):**  That's a mix of a clay body. You need a soil or native soil that has a  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:37):**  Decent amount of clay in it from 40 50 percent of clay body  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:41):**  Could be a little less but you used to figure out how much clay is in it to determine how much sand you're going to mix  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:46):**  in it  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:47):**  It all shapes down per se into the final mix being about 10 to 15 percent clay  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:04:53):**  And the rest is sand and so it's a very small amount of clay. You do not want very much clay in your floor and  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:00):**  Then you mix fibers in it  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:02):**  I've done various types of fibers, but the one I do the most is straw chopped straw, which is a brain  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:09):**  By-product of the brain industry for waste of cereal grain  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:14):**  so that clay  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:16):**  Soil body and the sand and the straw are mixed wet for the installation  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:21):**  I mix with the mortar mixer. You can mix it your feet or mix it in a little barrel and try it out  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:27):**  with wood floats steel trowels  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:31):**  I work to level it the best I can I use laser levels and very  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:35):**  bubble level  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:37):**  And at that point it's all trot out smooth  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:40):**  And you leave it for overnight or maybe two nights depending on how much moisture is in your air  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:46):**  So that it sets up just a little and then I go back and I re compress the whole floor  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:51):**  So I go back out on the floor with  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:54):**  They're called pans. There's these metal  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:05:57):**  Kind of like snowshoey slippery slidey pans that you are able to walk on the floor  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:03):**  I repress the whole floor and then continue to let it dry  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:06):**  the fans and dehumidifiers if need be and after  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:12):**  That three-quarters of inch you could get that thing to drive in less than a week five to seven days  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:17):**  And at that point I saturate the floor with oil  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:21):**  oil  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:23):**  Just the fuel in earth and floor at this point that I know of  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:28):**  hardening oil  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:29):**  Drying oils are used linseed oil is the main one that people know the glen dye uses  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:35):**  linseed oil  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:37):**  Tongue oil and it has pine linseed oil and tongue oil are both drying oil  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:41):**  I also have pine rosin and beeswax and some plant solvents to help it  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:47):**  saturate into the floor  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:49):**  so that blend gets applied to the  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:53):**  dry  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:06:54):**  Absorbent earth and floor and I do four or five coats all in one day, and then I let that cure  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:01):**  The oil harden over the next week, but fans very much needing fans when you're curing your oil  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:09):**  And after a week of oil drying I come back with a large  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:13):**  Floor sanding machine, and I stand the floor and that takes any  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:18):**  The rough edges from the oil kind of lifting the grain per se of the of the earth  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:24):**  It takes that edge off  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:26):**  It's not a necessary step, but it's it makes it a little smoother to walk on and at that point  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:34):**  It does scratch the surface that sanding and so I just put one more  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:38):**  application of oil on it at that point or you can do a wax coat at that point or some other  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:44):**  Finish that I haven't explored all the options, but there's ways of finishing it with maybe polyurethane  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:50):**  I haven't done all those things, but mainly I just do another coat of oil, and then it's ready that one leads to dry over the next  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:07:57):**  Five days yeah, and I know that that sounds like a lot of steps  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:01):**  But a lot of it is done in one or two days and the rest is dry time  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:05):**  Yes, yes, okay, so it's pretty  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:09):**  approachable for for a small crew of people right yeah, yeah the main labor day is the  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:16):**  that day  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:18):**  I was just a really big boy that day. We'll do the work of  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:23):**  Protect other surfaces around the floor like the walls or where it meets other floors  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:30):**  boring or  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:32):**  Track into the floor want to make sure you're not rolling your heavy wheelbarrow over somebody's nice finish  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:42):**  That is all very labor-intensive day  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:44):**  so you have your crew and I at this point you know size my crew depending on the size of the floor and  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:53):**  Everybody comes that day, but then the next day the pressing of the floor that's one or two people. It's a really big floor  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:08:59):**  It can be days of pressing or it could be days a couple people more than a couple people  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:05):**  But then the oiling also  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:08):**  Simple to do one or two people the sanding one or two people and that last cut of oil  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:13):**  so it's like a big push at the beginning and then  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:19):**  approachable for one or two people  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:21):**  Yeah, that's been my experience as well  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:26):**  Yeah, not that many days of labor just days of curing the mud and the oil for sure now  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:32):**  You've been doing this for quite a number of years  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:34):**  How have you sort of tweaked and improved the process over that time to get the best results?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:40):**  Yeah  
**[0:09:42-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:42):**  But the first floor that I mentioned that I poured was very different than what I do now and the places that I can  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:52):**  highlight are  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:54):**  The use of tools in the beginning I didn't use to use a wood float  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:09:58):**  Or a stiff steel trowel I use a a swimming pool trowel a steel swimming pool trowel for the  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:05):**  Application as well as the burnishing and it made very bumpy rolly kind of floor and so a wood float has  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:12):**  No mercy it levels things and then the hard steel trowel that's very rigid and square  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:20):**  You could also  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:22):**  See where you have highs and lows because the points of the corners of the trowel really show your highs and lows  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:27):**  So those two trials really help  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:29):**  I get my floors flatter. I'm not needing it to be  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:35):**  So did flat that you don't notice any sort of natural feel of the hand  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:39):**  But you want to not have to wedge every piece of furniture in your house. So those steps were really vital  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:47):**  The mix itself I  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:51):**  I  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:53):**  Experimented with less and less clay over time  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:10:56):**  you get to a place that it has very little clay and  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:00):**  Work before me and in my early days at more clay and they had more tendency to crack  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:06):**  They also had a little bit more shine to them because the more clay in the mix  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:10):**  The more flat platelets of clay kind of sit on the surface, but I was more interested in  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:16):**  Getting to a point that I didn't have to deal with cracks or at least reducing the potential for cracks and so like I said  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:23):**  I make shakes down to about 10% clay body with the rest being fans and silts  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:31):**  The next  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:33):**  Sort of step of my process with that step. I mentioned that's optional of  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:38):**  Sanding the floor after the oil's been cured a week  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:42):**  And not a necessary step like I had mentioned, you know, we walk on the floors after they're oiled and our natural  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:49):**  Traffic of people walking living on floors will soften whatever edges are still there  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:11:55):**  But sanding it just does that all uniformly for you and you don't have as much grit  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:01):**  I think that the combination of me bringing my clay body down so far  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:07):**  Also added a little grit. So the sanding is just helping soften that  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:12):**  Sure, that makes sense  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:15):**  Yeah  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:17):**  And then bringing it into a product is a  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:20):**  Development that hadn't happened anywhere else yet. That's been an interesting journey of its own but  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:26):**  offering something that  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:28):**  someone can rely on and  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:30):**  And not have to do a bunch of recipe testing  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:35):**  Some people in the world let people still like to make their own  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:38):**  Sure, but it takes a lot of the guesswork out for people who are just getting started  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:42):**  Yeah  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:43):**  Nice now, what are some of the common misconceptions that people have about earthen floors?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:51):**  Well  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:12:55):**  Home shows often on through the years and even with my samples right there in front of them  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:00):**  People can touch them and they don't dust but people will have this are you gonna have a dusty floor?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:08):**  They think dirt floor. They think just compacted dirt. They don't think that it's actually  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:12):**  Healed and it's not really a dirt floor. It's makeup does have dirt, but it's  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:18):**  My name the name of the product I created clay Lin  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:22):**  The clay is the magic that holds together in the Lin linseed oil. There's only one of the oils, but it's like  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:28):**  It's vital. You will have a dusty floor. You still put oil on your floor  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:33):**  So dusty this might not be the same answer going for but people usually sit in the general public when I'm  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:40):**  Exposing these for people who have never heard of natural building people are surprised by how long it takes and I've gotten this  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:47):**  Install down to two and a half weeks, which is in my mind quite short. Yeah, I agree  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:52):**  And this blows people away. It's quite short. You know when we've if you come from natural building that feels  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:13:58):**  Like we shorten things sure the general public you could get a floor installed over a weekend. So  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:04):**  It's two weeks kind of blows people out. It surprises people. So they're  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:10):**  not  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:11):**  That's that's a shock to them. And then again, it's the same. It's more of a surprise reaction the  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:17):**  the install includes those  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:21):**  layers of oil and the smell and  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:25):**  Experience of the oil in in a home or in a construction site  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:29):**  Is strong and you can't live with that for the first couple days at the very least and it can still linger  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:37):**  to be kind of  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:41):**  Even a nuisance for a few weeks and so that's something that  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:46):**  Definitely part of the conversation to have with people in their first  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:49):**  Interacting with our floors and potentially choosing to have a different floor. Yeah, for sure  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:53):**  there's a little bit of a process until it fully gets settled in and and  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:14:56):**  It loses some of the the smell and and I don't know sometimes I've when I've installed floors  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:03):**  There's remained a little bit of a tackiness for a couple of weeks as well  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:07):**  While the oils take their time to dry  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:13):**  Yes, that's putting beeswax in it as well  
**[0:15:16-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:16):**  You might have a little too much beeswax. Okay. What ratio do you recommend? Very little. I don't know the exact ratio. I  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:28):**  Have my oil blended for me at this point it's pretty low  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:35):**  And I only really have it in the oil I don't do a beeswax application at the end  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:40):**  because what you're experiencing even if you bring it low wax takes a lot longer to cure than the oil right and so I  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:49):**  Again back to the wanting to keep it to the shortest amount of time  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:53):**  After you sand it and put another coat of oil on that oil will cure even with a little accident  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:15:59):**  Will cure in five days seven days at the most wax to take two more weeks for that wax to dry out  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:05):**  Ah, there we go. That's definitely where that comes in. Yeah  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:12):**  So no an airflow heat and airflow help cure it  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:17):**  but uh too much wax  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:20):**  Like it just needs to be a really thin layer. So if you're having any  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:26):**  Kind of sensation of like  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:28):**  A little bit like if you can see the wax on the surface too much. Yeah, I want to be getting in there  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:36):**  Know what are some of the main factors to consider when trying to install an earthen floor in a  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:42):**  Conventional home or even on possibly a second story floor  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:47):**  Any situation that you're gonna free putting an earthen floor there's going to be a subfloor  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:52):**  so  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:16:53):**  that's it there's three different types of sub floors like I said and you asked about second floors and  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:00):**  many conventional homes  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:02):**  The first floor is this way too. So I'll address the framing structure  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:06):**  questions that you're alluding to the  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:10):**  stick frame joint with some sort of membrane the plywood or  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:16):**  There's other forms of membranes but typically plywood you want that structure to be able to hold the weight  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:22):**  so there's basic engineering that I  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:27):**  Typically hand-off didn't engineer but  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:30):**  Most structures if they're built to code they're able to hold the weight of the three inch  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:36):**  Concrete floor so having a three-quarter inch or even an inch and a half earth and floor. So weight is going to be fine  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:43):**  That's just dead weight then there's live load. So there's any sort of flexibility in the framing  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:49):**  again engineering typical  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:52):**  Construction is it's going to be engineered so that there's very little flex  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:17:57):**  But when I consulting with a homeowner do it yourself for an old house that you're coming into  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:04):**  You just want to have it stiff like you would be preparing for tile  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:10):**  There's a calculus about that that I can't get into that well  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:14):**  In this moment, but nonetheless it's an easy way to go in and check this is  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:21):**  having two people  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:23):**  or maybe more than two people one person laying on the ground and like watching the subfloor and  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:28):**  One or three people in the middle before kind of bouncing on it if there's any movement  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:32):**  more than a quarter inch or so  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:34):**  We won't be able to measure it. But if it's really movement in the floor, that's too much movement for an earth and floor  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:40):**  so those are some  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:42):**  quick ways of checking your  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:45):**  Because deflection you don't want your floor to the subfloor to deflect  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:50):**  So that said that the structure needs to hold the weight and not to flex when you're coming into a space like that also  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:18:58):**  You have that wood  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:02):**  Fly wood  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:05):**  Underneath and you don't want that fly wood to get wet  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:07):**  It won't be wet for very long it's going to be wet for just a period of time that you're pouring the floor  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:15):**  Then it drying out but the edges of plywood when they get wet they can crinkle if you've seen that happen  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:21):**  And so what I put down before I put the earth  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:24):**  On top of why would I put a tar paper material?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:27):**  There's this very thin flat lean tar paper material of aqua Barbie. It's just something I've found  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:35):**  underlayment for  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:37):**  Like clip together floorings, but it could be any sort of  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:41):**  Heavy construction waxy paper just something that's going to basically stop the moisture in your mud from  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:48):**  Getting your plywood wet. That's something to consider and then wherever your floor is needing other floor  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:55):**  You need to consider what that's going to look like  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:19:57):**  Is it going to be a butt joint that you're going to have to make sure you continue?  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:01):**  maintaining as you trowel and you burnish and  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:04):**  You oil making sure that those two floors meet and they still look good together  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:10):**  And that's the maintenance of just troweling it well and you want to tape off  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:15):**  so you're not getting your mud and your oil on the other floor and  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:19):**  You want to consider that sometimes you don't want tape to be there for days and days you might have to tape it do your  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:26):**  Oiling take it off tape it do your sanding you know take the tape off in every step  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:32):**  or you could have  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:37):**  various types of  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:40):**  Threshold can help meet those two materials like a key joint so that  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:46):**  You don't actually see the joint between the two floor materials  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:49):**  That's the way to hide it there's a lot of answers, but you just need to consider where it's meeting  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:20:54):**  You also need to consider where it's meeting walls if you know confront conventional houses are usually square  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:01):**  And so they're often  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:03):**  going to have trim  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:05):**  base board up against  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:09):**  all the walls and I suggest I  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:13):**  strongly  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:14):**  request that we  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:16):**  Install earth and floors before they put base board in and I work to level that nice and tight for the  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:24):**  Carpenters so that they don't have to scribe their base boards  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:26):**  but the baseboard what it does is it covers any sort of shrinkage of the earth and floor away from the wall and  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:33):**  That doesn't have to be that way some people don't want trim and so you have to  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:38):**  really do a lot to care for  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:41):**  making to push back the earth at that corner if there's any pullback and again like I was mentioning with the  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:49):**  Connection to another floor you want to tape off that wall  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:51):**  And you're going to want to take that tape off in each step it's tape when it gets wet  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:21:58):**  It'll start sticking to the surface underneath you want to take it off if you get oil on it  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:02):**  It'll stick even more to the circuit you have to manage that edge a lot sure having a baseboard really helps  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:09):**  reduce the amount of labor on the gene the edges  
**[0:22:11-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:11):**  And then conventional if you're doing existing structures and people want to be living in them  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:21):**  Soon after or even during you want to make sure that they will not be living in there those couple days  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:27):**  At the very least after you put the oil on this it's too many  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:32):**  Vapors for people to be living in it  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:35):**  Does need to also be considered that it is going to smell for a while after that but those for a couple days are when?  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:39):**  The actual do see is the natural vocs of the solvent the citrus and the pine solvents are off gassing  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:47):**  The rest of it's just the curing of oil which  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:50):**  Isn't a voc issue, but it is so strong and smell  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:55):**  Sure, no  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:22:59):**  Yeah, yeah, and you know there's always variables with each different project too. I'm sure you know about that  
**[0:23:04-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:04):**  Each one is a little bit different so yeah, so I mean everybody who's trying this out either at their own home  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:12):**  Or on another job is gonna find a couple of variants that you know it's just it's worth figuring into any job now  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:20):**  What are the most important ways?  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:23):**  To maintain an earthen floor especially to prevent cracking and stains  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:28):**  Well cracking for the most part  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:30):**  it has to do with the mix being too high of a clay content or  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:38):**  The install being too variable between batches like very wet wet batch next to very dry dry patch  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:45):**  Or your screen board being it like installed factors have a big effect on cracking  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:52):**  so having been so done well and  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:55):**  And  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:23:59):**  The suddenly or the movement of a structure the building itself can crack a floor  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:07):**  As well as point whether the building moves or not it suddenly moves even if it doesn't do a big movement  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:14):**  I'll point in the field to say you have a living room  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:17):**  And you're also going down a hallway outside of the living room  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:22):**  You're you're funneling the floors going from a large space down to a narrow space and the points of the corners of the hallway  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:30):**  That's kind of a little night  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:32):**  So it could crack you've seen it probably off of many concrete floors the corners where cracks  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:37):**  Sure, also in earthen plasters to that corner  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:41):**  Yeah, so you can lay underneath the floor between the floor and the corner you can  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:47):**  You can put a little bumper like a rubber tape bumper that you're covering with earth, but that gives a little bit of  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:24:56):**  protection from the movement of the  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:01):**  Adobe next to the movement of the of the frame structure you can also put control joints in  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:09):**  Thresholds like that so you could give the space for the tension to go through the control joint instead of cracking the  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:16):**  the mass of the floor  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:19):**  So that's all install and structure as for the maintenance is what you're asking  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:24):**  the forest  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:26):**  You know any floor  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:29):**  Maybe besides concrete, but still concrete can be scratched. See it serves us all I believe both  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:36):**  structurally and energetically to take our shoes off and not bring all of the crumbs and  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:41):**  bits that we collect on our shoes onto the floor that is a  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:46):**  bration that can scratch and just give damage to your floor, so  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:52):**  Shoes off is a good policy. It's not required these floors can handle that  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:25:57):**  But sweeping and vacuuming and then when you use any sort of soap you can use an oil-based soap  
**[0:26:04-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:04):**  a most common you know product that people can think of when they know that is Murphy's oil  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:11):**  So but there's other ones that are more ecological  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:15):**  Or at least their mission is that way eco ever and?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:19):**  Probably you could create your own oil-based soap and why you need oil-based soap is that you want to be  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:26):**  Adding oil to that there's change the oil that  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:31):**  The reason that oil dries and hardens and makes the floor the way it is it's creating  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:37):**  polymer chains basically  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:40):**  Plastic and I use oils that are plant-based so it's all plant-based  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:45):**  Plastic Network inside the floor and those chains are strong, but they won't last forever  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:51):**  They can weaken over time and when you're adding oil using oil, so you're kind of adding  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:26:57):**  Oil to help reconnect chains and keep them strong  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:02):**  You don't want to use a soap that's a solvent that will slowly degrade the chain connection  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:08):**  So it's a chemical thing in that you want oil-based soap  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:11):**  That's very cool. I didn't know about that before  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:15):**  Yeah, long-term maintenance you want to oil your floor again  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:18):**  If it starts to become tacky like you've never had a tacky floor  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:23):**  And then it starts to become tacky at some point my understanding back to chemistry  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:28):**  And this is me consulting with a chemist about it, but nonetheless the tackiness  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:34):**  Potentially the results of the chains breaking and they're kind of the ends of their chains are kind of up  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:40):**  And they're waiting to be connected. They're like I need to be connected  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:46):**  Cartoon vision vision there, but nonetheless  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:48):**  It helps to visualize that the oil chains are breaking and so you want to put more oil on  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:27:55):**  If you did so years and years and years without oil soap and no oil you can get tacky floors  
**[0:28:02-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:02):**  My my guidance would be to make me stand the floor just to get gorm off and then put new oil on  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:10):**  If you maintain it regularly just put more oil on  
**[0:28:14-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:14):**  Every three years five years ten years it goes beyond ten you might need to do more maintenance depending on the access  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:23):**  with a  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:26):**  Exposure the floors  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:27):**  Oil chains they break down from heat so rooms that are in the Sun  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:33):**  Or if you have heat in your floors those chains will break a little  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:37):**  Sooner maybe than a floor that doesn't have that that means that those are wonderful ways of having your floor in the Sun and happy  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:45):**  Heat so using all these folks really helps condition your floor in the oil particular  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:51):**  Nice, that's really cool about the soaps. I didn't know that from before now  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:55):**  Changing topics just a little bit here  
**[0:28:57-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:28:57):**  How did you decide to offer products and ready-made mixes of earth and floor for people who install it for themselves?  
**[0:29:18-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:29:18):**  I didn't necessarily actually think of do-it-yourselfers as much as I thought of other contractors, but either one I  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:29:28):**  Think do-it-yourselfers are actually more willing to have a pile of sand in a pile of clay in a pile of straw and process all  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:29:35):**  the material but as a contractor and you're showing up in a commercial even residential, but commercial kind of  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:29:43):**  Situation you've got other contractors  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:29:45):**  You've got the building inspectors  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:29:47):**  You got everything little pods of sand clay and straw and all the work to be involved in  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:29:52):**  Processing your clay right there on site because you don't want to process it somewhere else and bring it  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:29:56):**  Like that's a lot to ask the contractor to think they're going to take on earth and floors and do that  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:01):**  And I was getting tired as the contractor doing that so  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:05):**  Providing something that all that kind of behind the scenes processing is complete and you get a pallet  
**[0:30:12-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:12):**  With a stack of 50-pound bags of ready mix and all it is is the sand and the clay and the bag together for you  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:20):**  And there's a different bag for straw and it's ratioed out. You don't have to do any counting so it's easy to go so it's mainly  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:28):**  thinking to  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:30):**  bring  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:32):**  Something I love into an industry that doesn't have it. It wasn't necessarily thinking so much for the do-it-yourselfers though  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:39):**  I told you do-it-yourselfers, but I thought the consultant do-it-yourselfers on how to mix it with their own  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:46):**  local resource because they're  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:48):**  actually more  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:50):**  Typically open to that, but when someone's never heard of earth and floors, and they're a concrete contractor  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:57):**  in Nevada  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:30:59):**  Yeah, give me the product sure  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:01):**  So it's more for bringing it to a wider audience yeah  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:06):**  And it helps to take the guesswork and some of the experimentation out for people who just want to get a consistent result  
**[0:31:11-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:11):**  I see what you're saying  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:12):**  Yeah, for sure, and I wanted that too. I've been working with different clay bodies  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:17):**  I tried to actually focus in on like two different clay bodies that I worked with in Portland and that helped  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:23):**  My floors improve in the years prior to that product, but I still was having piles  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:28):**  Delivered and you can only get a yard or maybe half a yard increments and so often  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:35):**  I had extra sand piles and extra clay piles, and that's a lot of work to remove those from the job site  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:42):**  Yeah, of course now despite having a stronger background in natural building practices rather than industrial ones  
**[0:31:48-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:48):**  I know you're trying to work with the construction industry to help to diversify what they offer and the materials that they work with  
**[0:31:55-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:31:55):**  What materials and techniques do you think will be easiest for them to adopt?  
**[0:32:00-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:00):**  um  
**[0:32:01-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:01):**  Good question. I I think my passion sometimes gets in the way of like what's the reality but I  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:08):**  think products that  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:10):**  Can fit into the existing systems are?  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:15):**  much more accessible to  
**[0:32:17-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:17):**  The current industry or the mindset that's never had natural building products meaning  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:25):**  You know the product of clay lid or the product is even American clay, you know  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:30):**  those  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:32):**  You don't have to add the contractor figure out the key and the how-to is kind of similar to  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:38):**  the how-to of something else like applying  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:41):**  That product of clay plaster is similar to applying gypsum plaster so a plaster from the Union  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:49):**  Oh, I just need to know that I can't do the second coat till tomorrow. That's  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:32:54):**  Not much different than gypsum. It's just there's a day wait similar to the earth and floor  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:01):**  I've worked with many concrete concrete installers and they're  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:05):**  so quickly able to adapt they know how to trial oh, it's just the things are just taking longer between steps, so  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:15):**  having things  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:18):**  Already systematized is seemingly very helpful for the conventional building market and  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:28):**  It's very different than what  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:30):**  When I come out of natural, you know, the natural building mines like we work with what we have and we find ways to create  
**[0:33:36-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:36):**  I need a wall system. What do I have in my region? I love that aspect of what natural building is and it's it comes back to  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:44):**  resourcefulness and integrity and self responsibility and those things I  
**[0:33:50-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:50):**  Want that to be where the world's going and I often why I brought these materials into you know  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:33:57):**  for the plasters they can they're kind of like a gateway between those mindsets and  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:04):**  the conventional systematic structure of the you know current building system and so  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:12):**  those those systems are  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:18):**  Closer to meeting each other like it's just a replacement of your concrete. Look it's the same kind of steps, but here you go  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:23):**  that's a lot easier for someone who's in the regular system of the world not  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:30):**  having to like  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:32):**  We invent the wheel, you know, they don't know it sounds like you're getting into  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:37):**  Transferable skills that they can you know take from one job and apply it to a new material  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:43):**  Yeah, the main thing that's really different for them is that it all takes a lot longer so  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:49):**  It's the biggest thing that they're like, whoa two weeks. I'm like, yes, you're a  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:55):**  Okay  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:34:57):**  Now you've also mentioned to me before that you would like to see natural building be adopted by labor unions  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:02):**  What impacts do you think this would have on the natural on natural building as an industry?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:07):**  Or do you see it as being an aspect of the construction unions that already exist? Oh  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:12):**  I would say I see it as being a part of the construction unions that already exist. I I  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:20):**  think that  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:22):**  There's more people  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:24):**  in the world of construction and in unions than there are natural builders and I think it's a good system unions are about  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:32):**  Good paying jobs health care  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:35):**  Supporting your family like there's a lot of quality. We don't need to reinvent that and  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:39):**  and  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:41):**  Union systems in place of like okay you come in and you you learn these systems and you're an apprentice and then you become  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:49):**  a plaster and then you're a master plaster and  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:52):**  and  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:35:53):**  you can take that tool and you can work the union is like funnel system to the job and  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:00):**  If they just had other things that they started training people on  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:04):**  You know, then they know how to do our this work or they would know how to do earth and clusters  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:10):**  and that's already happening in some clusters around here, but I  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:15):**  mentioned that because I'm currently  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:19):**  Witnessing or maybe coming to understanding that  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:25):**  Specifically the plaster union in the Portland Metro region and likely other places  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:30):**  It's a dying art. There's not  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:34):**  Much plaster left. I mean, it's still happening  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:37):**  clusters product or moving more and more towards synthetic there's that but  
**[0:36:43-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:43):**  Many of the plasters at least what I've been exposed to recently is that they're going in and they're not even using  
**[0:36:50-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:50):**  Hawks and trials anymore. Their job is to spray on some plaster type of materials and chips them in a liquid floor  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:36:58):**  on to steel I beams or other wood frame structures to in case those  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:06):**  structures of large structures large buildings in a non flammable material so that  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:12):**  You know their fire ratings are safer  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:15):**  And so it's that they're working with wet chips and material so it is plaster  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:21):**  but the plasters aren't even plastering and I  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:24):**  I just I found that to be sad. I'm like if there was  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:30):**  If there was more call for plaster  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:33):**  So it's the supply and demand right there needs to be people that are walking and calling out for plaster  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:38):**  Specs for big buildings. Okay, we want plaster everywhere  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:42):**  So then there's actually a job for plaster  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:45):**  Yeah, so you think that maybe earthen plaster could be a way of  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:48):**  Could be a way of reviving this trade. Oh, I don't know about I  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:37:57):**  Think it could help. I don't know  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:00):**  If there's at this point enough call for like person's clusters to actually revive it, but if another layer of  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:07):**  Material and interest like if more people found themselves exposed to earth and plasters and like yeah, I want that  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:12):**  Oh, I want that in these cool settings or  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:15):**  In institutional setting bigger structures  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:20):**  Then more jobs would happen for clusters  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:26):**  Lime plasters also a little bit worse  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:32):**  stable work  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:34):**  able to be  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:35):**  beat up without  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:37):**  As much damage to the surface quick lectures are softer lime are a little harder  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:41):**  And that's what we specialize in we do clays and limes. So  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:46):**  both of those  
**[0:38:48-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:48):**  If they got called out more people wanted more of those surfaces, then we'd be able to call in more factors  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:38:57):**  Now this might tie into the next thing that I was  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:00):**  Yeah  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:01):**  Now I think this ties in a little bit to the next thing I was going to ask you about and you've spoken in the past  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:06):**  About the rituals around making form out of the materials around us and the relationships that are formed in this process  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:14):**  Could you give me a couple of examples of this? Yeah  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:19):**  But that connected you to that question  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:24):**  Definitely there's form of relationship in any connection of working together so  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:31):**  There's all those connections within  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:33):**  Conventional  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:37):**  Construction industry, but what you're bringing up is the part of  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:43):**  The stories that I have to share are coming from a different space. Okay. No, go ahead  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:48):**  I just made me think about this because you were talking about, you know, reviving different arts and practices. Yeah  
**[0:39:56-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:56):**  Well, it is very connected  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:39:59):**  Whenever you work with people  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:01):**  especially in their home  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:04):**  It gets very personal and a lot of  
**[0:40:08-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:08):**  different emotions and  
**[0:40:11-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:11):**  In subconscious behaviors just are there whether they're talked about or not. So I  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:18):**  Was just meeting with a client this morning and you know the beginning of that relationship  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:24):**  Is a ritual of itself, you know, you're just I'm there listening and the clients  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:31):**  They're just speaking all of their dreams and the wishes and their hopes  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:34):**  and then it moved into  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:36):**  design so that things get a little bit more solid and then  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:39):**  design is going to budget and things get even more solid and you have to make choices of  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:43):**  what to keep and what not to keep and then you get into construction and and  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:48):**  And there's expectations and how fast things are going to take and usually  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:40:55):**  Most people that are having contractors built for them have never been through a process so they could be surprised at different parts  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:02):**  So there's this journey that you go through with someone. It's just such  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:07):**  a high low high low  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:10):**  Expectations and disappointments and excitement and then eventually  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:14):**  There's a completion of a space and then you get to live with that space and then there's all of the years of maintenance  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:21):**  and questions of all that  
**[0:41:24-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:24):**  That's just highlighting the whole like arc of  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:28):**  What it is to be a contractor?  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:30):**  Creating space for someone and that's true. Whatever materials you're creating with  
**[0:41:35-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:35):**  I'm what I wanted to speak about was the potential for these natural building materials to  
**[0:41:44-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:44):**  Connect people to it. I believe something that's inherent for all humans is our interest and  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:54):**  Enjoyment of creating space  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:41:57):**  At this point in our humanity work all separated out and specialized. So you hire someone to hold in  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:03):**  I know that that was probably still somewhat true those specialization. We live more in village life  
**[0:42:10-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:10):**  But we were much more connected to it. I believe and I think even small projects can bring people back to that  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:18):**  Pathartic experience of like having a vision in their mind physically working with it and then ultimately having a form  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:25):**  in front of them and so  
**[0:42:27-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:27):**  So that could be small-scale situations I've done practices with youth I helped  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:35):**  these little kids go through a process of designing and then creating little models of  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:41):**  the scale of the little cost structures that they created where you know  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:47):**  eight inches tall and took up  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:50):**  one by two foot pieces plywood, so, you know, they got to go to the experience of  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:55):**  thinking of ideas  
**[0:42:57-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:42:57):**  designing them and then mixing the materials and then actually physically creating them and that's one small way to work with anybody whether it's  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:06):**  Someone who's really going to build or just that experience for you to recognize that they can create something  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:12):**  But on a even deeper level  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:16):**  Or just maybe a different part of our psyche I  
**[0:43:19-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:19):**  one time had an experience  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:21):**  That I gathered with four or five other people  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:27):**  We all had recently experienced a death in our lives someone quotes and it was a  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:33):**  journey that we all came together and  
**[0:43:37-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:37):**  Did some shamanic kind of  
**[0:43:39-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:39):**  dreaming together and  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:41):**  The intention and the creation of that day was that we did that work quietly inside and then we all came out  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:48):**  to this cob wall that was there and we  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:52):**  replastered we just put a new coat of plaster on this wall and  
**[0:43:56-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:56):**  There was no  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:43:58):**  vocal experience of the actual classroom  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:01):**  We went from that dream state into putting plaster on the wall. There was no training on my part  
**[0:44:06-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:06):**  everybody just took  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:08):**  The mud and smeared it on and used their own intuition and it was  
**[0:44:13-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:13):**  very  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:15):**  rich for everybody to like have that experience of just feeling their own  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:20):**  Intuition of how to put something as simple as an urban plaster on a cob wall  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:25):**  so that was  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:27):**  One of the rituals that I was thinking of when I shared that with you and the other  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:32):**  a little less  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:34):**  well a little bit more temporary I  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:38):**  Experienced the rituals  
**[0:44:40-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:40):**  Every four of us took the elements of the earth air water and fire we all created  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:48):**  experiences for people to  
**[0:44:51-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:51):**  Engage in those elements and I got to  
**[0:44:54-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:44:54):**  Hold a face for earth and I had a very white sheetrock wall room and I just had a bucket of  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:03):**  wet clay  
**[0:45:05-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:05):**  soil basically flipped  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:07):**  Kind of a slippery as a thick milkshake and people got to just express themselves with their hands on these white walls  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:15):**  with that mud material and  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:17):**  again that was  
**[0:45:20-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:20):**  less of a  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:24):**  Construction result, but it was in a space that people got to create that space with their own hands with mud  
**[0:45:31-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:31):**  And why person materials really think?  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:33):**  kids leave these  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:37):**  Experiences easily into people's lives is that they're non-toxic. They're available there  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:43):**  You can clean them off the walls or you can redo it. It's nothing that's going to be  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:52):**  Damaging to your skin or to the environment around it  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:45:55):**  It's a simple material that's accessible and it just has a lot of there's a lot of play involved people  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:01):**  Feel really excited to play in the mud  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:04):**  everybody I've ever been around the plate in the mud would be  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:08):**  You know surprised there are you knew they liked it or they didn't think they would and then they're like, oh my god  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:14):**  This is so fun. I think you made some really great points there about the connectivity and the accessibility not just of the  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:21):**  The materials but like you're talking about these rituals and these processes that come out when people interact  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:26):**  With the earth or you know with other natural materials it goes along really well with something that do you know Kirk Mobert?  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:33):**  I just interviewed him recently and he talks a lot about the re-indigenization  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:37):**  Of building practices and it's just like you were talking about these things don't have  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:43):**  You know engineering specs are really rigid  
**[0:46:46-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:46):**  guidelines for how to interact with them and it opens up a lot of possibilities for people to not only be creative with  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:53):**  with you know the outcome and the result of what the thing looks like but with the process and with the experience of  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:46:59):**  Working with the materials as well and I'm really glad that you brought that up  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:05):**  Yeah  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:06):**  there's also  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:08):**  the  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:09):**  the labor intensive part when if you really are gonna build a  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:14):**  Cod structure or a stroke. There's a lot of labor involved  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:18):**  When it comes back to natural building materials, it's more laborious than it is  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:24):**  Manufactured elsewhere right so even if it's a construction site  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:29):**  Like I have a crew of people and we're there and we're there to get the job done  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:33):**  And it is you know I'm people getting paid  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:37):**  but there's  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:38):**  an easy  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:40):**  There's not as many power tools involved  
**[0:47:42-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:42):**  There's like room for conversation and connection just because the materials don't require so many isolating  
**[0:47:52-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:52):**  Safety mechanisms ear and eye  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:55):**  You know respirators  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:47:58):**  That you do need to have things that stop you from being able to hear each other  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:02):**  But when you're plastering a wall together for the most part everybody can hear each other and great conversations come out of it  
**[0:48:09-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:09):**  And so there's a connection. Yeah, that's another great point. It does sort of facilitate a more social environment on the work site. I agree  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:17):**  Yeah  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:18):**  It does make for a more enjoyable experience  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:20):**  I spent probably about six years in the industrial construction and  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:25):**  Engineering trades and when I switched over to natural building that was definitely one of the first things that I noticed  
**[0:48:30-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:30):**  It was just how much more sociable and accessible  
**[0:48:33-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:33):**  The thing you know the interactions between people in between the environment you're working with were without those added barriers that are constantly needed  
**[0:48:41-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:41):**  Either you know for noise protection or respiratory protection all those other things that that kind of remove you from the experience  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:49):**  Well great, so yeah before I have to wrap up now  
**[0:48:53-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:53):**  How can people learn more about your work your product line and any courses or workshops that you might have coming up?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:48:59):**  a good question my website claylin.com  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:05):**  claylin  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:08):**  claylin.com  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:10):**  has a  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:13):**  Workshop page on it, so that's definitely where you find out about any trading that I have  
**[0:49:18-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:18):**  And I mean I also have a website  
**[0:49:21-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:21):**  vikita.com s u k i t a.com and it's in the works to sort of bring out other aspects of my  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:30):**  offerings like design and consulting kind of aspects  
**[0:49:35-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:35):**  There's a link on that page that also has events so both of those pages  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:40):**  Whenever I do have something new I update both of those at the same time  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:44):**  that being said they both have some need of upgrade, but that's the best way to  
**[0:49:49-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:49):**  See what is next in my world. I do have a newsletter link and there's  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:49:57):**  Some revamping of the newsletter so that will be coming with some new features soon  
**[0:50:04-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:50:04):**  But yeah the workshop  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:50:07):**  Event page is the best place to know what's happening  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:50:11):**  Wonderful, and I'll make sure to put links to all of those things on the show notes for this episode as well  
**[0:50:14-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:50:14):**  Hey, well, thank you so much for taking the time to keep it was a real pleasure talking to you. We learned a whole lot today  
**[0:50:22-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:50:22):**  Yeah, thank you. I appreciate what you're doing in the world and I  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-011-sukita-reay-crimmel/#t=0:50:26):**  Checked out some of the interviews you've had you definitely talked to a lot of the

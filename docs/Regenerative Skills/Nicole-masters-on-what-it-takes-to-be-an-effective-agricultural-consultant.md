**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:06:40):**  been doing one on one during COVID, I put that on the side just because it was so much  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:06:46):**  of my work involves travel and it all just suddenly got really hard.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:06:50):**  And out of that was born the coaches school.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:06:52):**  So I've stepped away from really that one on one work to look at how do we build capacity  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:06:58):**  so that we can create more of what I'm doing because it's been incredibly successful.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:06):**  And when we look to hire people in regions, we found that people really didn't have the  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:10):**  level of expertise that we require to be part of our coaching team.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:15):**  And so the depth that I'm looking for is people that can read landscapes can connect from  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:21):**  soil microbiology to soil minerals to animal health to plant health to human health.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:26):**  Like it's a big ask looking at how water is moving through a system to be able to come  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:34):**  onto a property and really see all the different dynamics.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:38):**  And then the biggest part of that is the working with human element.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:41):**  And often people that are really good with animals aren't so great with people.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:44):**  And we just felt like there were these gaps that needed to be expanded outwards in order  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:51):**  to be what we see as incredibly successful coaching, which is being able to work with  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:07:56):**  people, listen to people, not come in as an expert and think that you have all the answers  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:01):**  because every context and every individual is different and you're working at a very  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:05):**  individual level.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:08):**  And the level of training to do that as I've started to realize as we're expanding this  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:11):**  program is it's a big ask.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:14):**  It is.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:15):**  And I can imagine why that's difficult to find people who are up to the level that you  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:18):**  would like to incorporate into your team because it involves wearing so many hats, not all  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:22):**  of which are conducive to the skill set of anybody who excels in any given one of them.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:27):**  Where do you find some of the biggest gaps in competencies that you really look for to  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:34):**  set people apart and join your team?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:38):**  People that have really done their own self-development work, because I find that you have not transformed  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:43):**  your own trauma, you bring that into every conversation with everybody.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:49):**  And so it's being able to see your own patterns actually helps you to work with other people's  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:54):**  patterns and that's some of the biggest work and it's some of the hardest stuff and it's  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:08:59):**  a lifetime process.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:01):**  You never kind of go, oh yeah, I've done personal development, tick that box.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:06):**  It's an everyday, all day working process.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:08):**  And I think for the students of our current program, that's been their biggest breakthroughs  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:15):**  and transformations is realizing all these layers of work to be done to transform so  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:21):**  that we can be in a space that really invites curiosity and adaptiveness and resilience  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:27):**  instead of being a space of disempowering potential clients.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:34):**  Because if you think, I know, if you don't engage with all of the different dynamics  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:40):**  that someone's working with, then they're not going to be successful.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:45):**  One of the classes that we teach is what we call the ecology of money.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:49):**  So looking at what is your current story around money and then how does that shape your success?  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:09:55):**  How does that shape your decisions around finances, your ancestral stories around money?  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:01):**  How does that shape you today?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:04):**  Because there's a lot of stories maybe around struggle, around, I've met people that feel  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:10):**  shame around money or people that think money is greed.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:14):**  No, money doesn't mean any of that.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:17):**  It's a transaction for here's something that I'm offering you.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:20):**  In this case, it's an opportunity and here's a financial transaction.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:24):**  And we just make it mean all this other stuff that it doesn't mean.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:26):**  Well, if we can transform that conversation for ourselves, we can start to see where that  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:31):**  shows up with people that we're working with, because if you're working with someone that  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:35):**  thinks that money is struggle and greed, they're never going to be the success that they want  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:40):**  to be in terms of the financial side of things.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:42):**  And that can be huge in agriculture.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:44):**  Yeah, and it looks to me that that is the piece that is really hard to teach, whether  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:51):**  you have the communications or personability skills in order to walk someone through what  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:10:57):**  is essentially a very personal transition.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:00):**  The landscape is almost the more binary and more easy to control aspect of this.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:05):**  But if you don't get the mindset, the rest is going to be very much an uphill battle.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:11):**  And that can be very different based on someone's, like you said, past trauma, their personal  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:15):**  history, their connotations with different aspects of their job, with money, all of these  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:21):**  things.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:22):**  Where do you start that process and begin to connect with someone so that these types  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:26):**  of sort of emerging personal traits can come out and be worked on?  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:31):**  Well, you start by doing the work yourself, and then it just becomes like if we can be  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:38):**  truly authentic, if we can be truly vulnerable and open and create different types of dynamics  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:44):**  and patterns when we're working with people, then what the traditional extension consultant,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:50):**  expert, teacher dynamic was.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:54):**  Like it's a totally different way of exploring things.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:11:57):**  And once you create that space in yourself, then it invites more inquiry and more dialogue  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:04):**  because people don't feel one that you're making them wrong or that you're judging them  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:08):**  or that somehow, yeah, you've come in and you're going to wave this magic wand because  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:16):**  it all comes down to what's that person's ability to alter some things that are happening  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:23):**  on their property or alter some things that are happening for themselves.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:27):**  And that happens through conversation and it happens through questions.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:31):**  We don't sit there and go, well, I can see that you have this issue with money and you  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:35):**  really need to deal with your childhood trauma.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:38):**  That's not how those conversations go at all.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:41):**  It's very much like that's really interesting.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:44):**  And where do you think that came from?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:46):**  Or when did that conversation first start to happen?  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:50):**  Or what is your experience with money?  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:54):**  And money has become this conversation that people are really uncomfortable even talking  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:12:57):**  about, but it's a big limitation, right?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:00):**  The amount of debt that's happening in agriculture is just phenomenal.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:04):**  And so I'll often share my own personal story of, you know, I spent 18 months working on  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:08):**  this conversation of what, why was it that I could never get out of debt?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:14):**  Why was it that no matter what, I was always struggling?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:18):**  I always had credit card debt, couldn't really achieve what I wanted to achieve.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:23):**  And it wasn't until I started pulling these layers back that I realized, one, I did think  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:28):**  that money was a struggle.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:30):**  And then I had to work really, really hard in order to achieve financial freedom, which  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:34):**  is my goal.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:35):**  Like, I don't want to be a multi-billionaire and go to Mars.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:38):**  That's not my goal at all.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:41):**  But what I saw out of all of it was that I was actually waiting for somebody to bail  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:44):**  me out.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:45):**  Like, I've had that experience in my teens and early 20s of getting in trouble, and my  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:51):**  dad would save me.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:53):**  And so part of me was like, okay, I need this to happen.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:57):**  I'll just wait for someone to bail me out.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:13:58):**  And it wasn't until I realized that I had that conversation going on, I was like, oh,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:02):**  I'm not waiting for anybody.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:03):**  I'm going to do this myself.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:05):**  So like the CREATE program cost $290,000 to develop.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:10):**  I didn't get any sponsorship.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:12):**  I didn't go and get any grants.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:14):**  I did that whole thing myself through building it and just going through a process of transforming  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:20):**  my own financial conversation to creating something that's been incredibly successful.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:24):**  Wow, that's an amazing story.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:27):**  And like the example you just gave, this starts with doing that personal work, and only through  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:32):**  reference of having worked through it yourself, can you start to help someone else in their  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:36):**  process?  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:37):**  And, okay, so let's talk about some of the frameworks or the questions.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:42):**  No, please, go ahead, jump in.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:43):**  Oh, I just, part of it happens through our language too.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:47):**  So it's looking at what are the words that I'm choosing to use?  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:52):**  What am I not using?  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:53):**  And a word like help engenders that someone is helpless.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:14:58):**  And if I come into a space that I'm helping somebody, it's like, oh, there's something  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:02):**  we need to fix.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:03):**  There's something that's not working so good for you.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:06):**  And I'm here to help.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:07):**  But that's not the role that we play at all.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:10):**  The role is, how do I empower you, how do I work alongside and learn with you while  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:15):**  we go through this process together?  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:17):**  So it's a totally different dynamic just by shifting that one word.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:22):**  And so that's a big part of the work as well.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:26):**  And we screw up, you know, and I'm a New Zealander, we say very tactless things, and that's part  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:29):**  of it too.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:30):**  So not being too worried about, oh, I said this word, but just starting to look at where  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:35):**  am I coming from?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:36):**  What is my context in my language?  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:38):**  Yeah, I really like that you brought up the wording about this.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:41):**  And from our last conversation, I actually stopped calling things watersheds and have  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:45):**  been adopting the term water catchment.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:47):**  And I think I'm going to try and work the term help in these contexts out of my vocabulary  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:52):**  as well.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:53):**  I really like the way that you clarified that.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:55):**  And wording is really important.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:15:56):**  I'm constantly coming up and crashing up against it as I navigate different languages here  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:00):**  in the European context.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:03):**  The way that you explain things and the way that you communicate them is essential.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:07):**  And so, okay, so moving away from this idea of help, because like you said, it comes with  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:12):**  the presumption that someone does not have the ability to help themselves.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:15):**  This is much more of a coaching or an assistance role and helping someone find the tools that  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:20):**  they may already have, but maybe needed to be rephrased or someone needed to help them  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:25):**  to audit their process.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:26):**  It sounds like you're doing through special questioning.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:31):**  Perhaps do you have some frameworks that you work through?  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:34):**  For example, I have been learning a lot about holistic management lately, and there are  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:37):**  frameworks there that help you to audit your thinking process and systematically go through  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:43):**  the things that you need to consider in order to better make decisions.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:47):**  Is that something that you work with as well?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:49):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:52):**  And again, it's on a very individual basis.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:16:55):**  And so I'm always looking for where is that door that I can just chink open a little bit  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:01):**  around connecting with landscapes, connecting with soil health or resilience, especially  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:08):**  when we're working with very conventional producers, you know, and they're just looking  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:13):**  for a practice change.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:15):**  And it can be a little bit of a shock when you start working with a coach in terms of  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:18):**  this is much more than a practice change and not wanting to overwhelm people, give them  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:24):**  to like there's so many options.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:26):**  There's no one way that you will do any of this land management.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:29):**  So looking for what is the current capacity, what kind of equipment have they got?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:35):**  What are the resources on a property and working with them on what we call the bright spots?  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:41):**  What's what's already working really well?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:44):**  What do you what do you already excel in?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:47):**  And it might be that animal husbandry, it might be being really great with equipment  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:53):**  and just kind of working with where people's where they feel more comfortable and they  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:57):**  can flourish and we're working within those frameworks.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:02):**  And then we have what I call the five M's that we which is our mindset, our management,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:08):**  our minerals, microbes and organic matter form, which is kind of cheating.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:13):**  And so using that framework that we lay over what is not working as well as it could in  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:18):**  this landscape and which of those is the issue?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:21):**  What is it that's putting a drag on your particular system?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:24):**  And we'll we'll run through that using another framework, which is the triage.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:29):**  So the triage is where's our decision making process start?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:33):**  If there's a critical point, what's that critical point?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:35):**  So the first place is how well are you capturing sunlight energy?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:39):**  And that might be disrupted.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:42):**  If we look at the five M's that might be because of your management.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:45):**  All right, so you haven't been managing for a solar panel to be capturing sunlight energy.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:51):**  It might be a mineral deficiency.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:52):**  All right, we haven't got adequate boron.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:54):**  So sugars aren't moving through the plant in terms of photosynthesis.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:57):**  So we start with sunlight, then we go to air, then we go to water, then we go to decomposition  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:02):**  and then we go to minerals.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:04):**  So there's a whole process that we look through that five M's through in terms of where's  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:10):**  the critical point for someone to be looking at and then bringing that back into what someone's  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:15):**  dealing with every single day.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:17):**  You know, most people are dealing with weeds and pests and diseases and increasing concerns,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:22):**  obviously, around resilience, either having too much water or not enough water.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:27):**  So having these conversations through that and that's where we work through that personal  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:33):**  capacity.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:35):**  So I wouldn't sit down with someone in their very first conversation and go, tell me about  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:39):**  your relationship with money.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:41):**  Like it takes trust and rapport and a relationship like you build that ability to expand.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:48):**  And there's things that I think as a soundboard or as a coach, people see for themselves.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:53):**  And yeah, that just comes up through conversation.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:56):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:58):**  And where do you see that often those bottlenecks are happening?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:02):**  Are there indicators that are some of the first things that you look for that are where  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:07):**  things are starting to congeal and stop moving?  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:11):**  Or is it really different everywhere that you go?  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:16):**  I wish I could say it was really different, but no, we seem to see some very similar patterns  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:22):**  around mismanagement.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:25):**  And that comes down to the basis of soil structure.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:28):**  So seeing soil structure that's falling apart, crusting, compacting.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:34):**  And so that all disrupts photosynthesis, that all disrupts air movement.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:39):**  So I think I missed out air.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:40):**  So air is your number one.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:41):**  How well is that soil aggregated?  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:44):**  Is air able to move through?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:45):**  And if not, water is not able to move through either.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:49):**  And so what we see is if you've been using a lot of agrochemicals, then that's going  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:54):**  to disrupt soil structure.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:56):**  Have you been using tillage?  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:57):**  That will do it.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:59):**  Have you been removing every blade of green grass?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:02):**  Well, all of that's going to screw up that soil's ability to breathe.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:06):**  So I find one of the most powerful tools we can use is one of the oldest tools, which  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:10):**  is just digging a hole with somebody and looking at, do you think a soil like this can breathe?  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:15):**  Do you think water can move into this?  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:17):**  We'll do an infiltration test as well.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:20):**  But looking in the field and then looking somewhere that hasn't been disturbed, making  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:25):**  sure we're on the same soil type, but measuring something, say, underneath a fence line.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:30):**  And that could be the door chinking open that it was talking about that aha of like, was  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:35):**  this me?  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:36):**  Yes, this was you.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:40):**  So I find those visual tools, particularly, obviously, for producers, you know, for visual  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:46):**  people that that can.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:48):**  It can make a huge difference.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:50):**  And all the things that you just mentioned of just going in and digging a hole and doing  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:21:54):**  some tactile testing, they all seem very simple, but you have an academic background in soil  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:00):**  science and years and years of experience going out and seeing this in so many different  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:04):**  places.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:06):**  Is this something that takes a really long time to learn and develop?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:09):**  Or is this something that you've seen people be able to pick up really quickly, even without  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:13):**  all that experience and academic background?  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:17):**  It's kind of fun.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:18):**  They did a study in California asking people to smell soil, and they had people in the  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:24):**  cities, they had people with no agricultural experience or gardening experience, and they  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:30):**  lined up the soils from really nasty, bad, bad soil to beautiful, aggregated soil.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:36):**  And everybody could tell the difference between bad, good and ugly.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:41):**  Like people are able to distinguish that just with our nose, even if you've never been out  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:45):**  in agriculture, which I love that.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:49):**  But one thing that we've developed is called the Regen platform.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:51):**  And we did that with Soil Mentor in the UK with Abby Rose.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:57):**  And I just I love the program.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:22:59):**  And what we did when I came to her originally, we had a consultant level app that we were  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:04):**  using just for our team that had like probably 100 different metrics.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:08):**  And we were like, can we put this into an app and we'll make it available to farmers?  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:12):**  And the farmers were like, well, that's just so overwhelming and unusable.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:16):**  I'm like, oh, come on, it's brilliant.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:18):**  No, you want to know all this, but actually not.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:21):**  So we distilled it down to what we would say these are the 10 Regen indicators.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:26):**  If we had to choose just 10, and often they all interrelate and correlate with each other  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:31):**  anyway, but not only do we give people the measures, we also described how to do it.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:38):**  We describe what it means.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:40):**  And then we get into what could be the factors that are causing this and then what could  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:43):**  that be the possible actions you could take.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:46):**  So there's no other app like that available in the world right now.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:50):**  We're really excited about it.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:51):**  And the idea really was to make this much more accessible so that, you know, within  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:23:56):**  half an hour you could feel like you've got competency around reading your own soil.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:03):**  So that's really cool.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:05):**  So go and check that out.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:07):**  For sure.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:08):**  I'll be sure to leave the link for that in the show notes for this episode so everyone  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:10):**  can link to it directly.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:13):**  What are some of the other key skills and observational experience or knowledge that  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:18):**  is really essential to being effective in this career?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:22):**  My original background is in ecology, well, my formal background is ecology.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:27):**  And I also did organizational learning.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:29):**  And organizational learning is business skills seen through the veil of ecological thinking,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:35):**  you know, feedback loops and unintended consequences.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:38):**  And I think that has probably held me in the best stead in terms of considering what are  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:45):**  the potential interrelationships and then what might be an unintended consequence of  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:50):**  taking this action.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:51):**  And I really believe if governments were looking through that veil, if the universities were  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:55):**  looking through that and researchers were, we'd have some very different outcomes than  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:24:59):**  what we currently have.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:02):**  Thinking there's so many.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:04):**  Well, so your program on training consultants and coaches is not an open application.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:12):**  You have application criteria, which are quite rigorous.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:17):**  What are some of the main things that you're looking for, for people to come in and apply  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:20):**  with you in order to take that next step?  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:23):**  And I guess the flip side would also be what are the deal breakers or the red flags of  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:27):**  people who you don't think are going to do well?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:31):**  The red flags that kind of come to mind immediately are people that are, that they allow their  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:36):**  ego to walk through the door first.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:37):**  We talk about that.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:39):**  You know, we've turned down some really, really deserving agronomists who have all the technical  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:44):**  and the experience that's required, but they're not coachable.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:48):**  And they are very much in that expert, it's almost like a colonizing control mindset.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:25:56):**  And that's the piece that is the hardest to shift in some people.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:02):**  And also, you know, if those people were to get into the course, they can be some of your  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:05):**  best advocates if they shift that mindset.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:08):**  But that's a lot of work.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:09):**  So the one thing we want to see experience, you know, this is not the course to come to  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:14):**  to learn about microbiology.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:16):**  This is not the course to learn about compost or grazing management and all the nutrients.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:22):**  We cover all of that.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:23):**  We bring it all together.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:24):**  But it's more in the context of this is for revision.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:28):**  And this is for how do we teach this to others?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:31):**  Or how do we break some of these very complex ideas down like, you know, quorum sensing  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:37):**  and microbial metabolites?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:38):**  How do we describe that in a way that's accessible for people?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:43):**  And so, yeah, good communication skills.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:47):**  A mindset that is a regenerative mindset, which is being curious, being open to being  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:53):**  coached yourself.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:56):**  You know, if you're not coachable, you're not going to make a very good coach at all.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:26:58):**  You're just going to be really dominating and obnoxious.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:01):**  But obviously, you know, a background in regenerative agriculture or organic production, or, you  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:10):**  know, we want at least three years of that so that it's not just people coming from an  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:14):**  academic space as well.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:16):**  So even if people have, you know, maybe they've gone through academia, they're already consulting  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:22):**  and maybe their own experiences, you know, maybe they've got a little lifestyle block  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:27):**  or a garden.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:30):**  But just as long as their hands are in the ground a bit.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:33):**  So yeah, and it's on a sliding scale.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:36):**  So if someone came to us, they don't have any academic background.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:40):**  But they have incredible observation skills and that willingness to learn and have been  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:45):**  working on landscapes, then yeah, they're probably likely to get in.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:50):**  And of all these skills that we've been talking about, are there ones that you just don't  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:53):**  even try and teach?  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:54):**  Either someone has it or they don't.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:27:57):**  And it's not something that you've figured out how to convey to someone who may be missing  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:01):**  it.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:02):**  Yeah, I think that piece very much comes down to that mindset again.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:06):**  You know, it's our philosophy that guides our principles, which guide your practices,  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:13):**  you know, so if you have a philosophy that and I see this a lot, actually, even in regenerative  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:18):**  agriculture, and we're seeing it with a lot of, sorry, we're seeing it with a lot of regenerative  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:25):**  companies that are coming into this space, and they're like, we've got these products,  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:28):**  and, you know, we're doing this, and we're doing that.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:32):**  But they haven't changed their philosophy.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:34):**  Their deep philosophy is it becomes abhorrent to even do some of the practices that we do,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:40):**  it becomes abhorrent to treat animals in a certain way.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:44):**  Because you feel so connected to that landscape, to those animals, to those people, so that  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:50):**  equity, justice, all of this comes into play.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:55):**  And that's driven by that bigger philosophy.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:28:57):**  So if the philosophy is still command and control, and whoa, I'm going to make big bucks  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:02):**  out of this stuff, this is probably not the program for you.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:06):**  Right now, we've gone over just how broad of a knowledge base and set of experiences  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:11):**  that are needed to excel at this at the level that you would expect for someone to join  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:15):**  your team.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:16):**  And it's a rare person who has an academic background, a farming background, the personal  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:22):**  communication skills, has done personal work themselves.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:26):**  So this is quite a selective process.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:28):**  However, there are people who can specialize in certain aspects and perhaps not be quite  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:33):**  as large a generalist, but be effective in certain aspects of what they're able to convey  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:38):**  as far as knowledge or guidance along the business building or land management process.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:43):**  Is it really essential for people to be this well versed?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:46):**  Or can you be very effective if, let's say, you just know like the back of your hand,  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:51):**  soil science alone, or work very well with grazing systems or finances?  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:57):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:29:58):**  And specialize and do those well.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:00):**  Totally.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:01):**  And some of the people on this existing program are some of the best graziers in the world  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:07):**  and don't have any academic background, brilliant observers, and are very coachable.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:14):**  You know, they're able to have those hard conversations about themselves and have that  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:20):**  willingness.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:21):**  So I feel like that's what I'm saying, it's very much on a sliding scale.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:28):**  It says people come to us, we go, you are incredible.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:32):**  You have all the spirit and the generosity and the creativity.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:36):**  And here's some other training to go and maybe look at.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:39):**  So we've been sending people to Elaine Ingham's courses or John Kemp's courses or go and do  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:45):**  the landmark forum, which is just one of the best, you know, personal professional development  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:51):**  programs, go and do some of those and then come back to us because you have everything  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:55):**  else in place.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:30:57):**  Yeah, and we found, you know, it's intensive.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:00):**  This is the level of a master at, if not a PhD that we cram into four months.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:06):**  And it's a big ask if you if, yeah, some of those foundations are a little wobbly.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:12):**  And from a farmer's perspective, now, I'm personally very new into consulting at a farm  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:17):**  scale.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:18):**  I've done ecological restoration work and I started kind of in natural building and  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:23):**  permaculture design.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:24):**  And only for a couple of years now have I actually been working directly with producers.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:28):**  But there seems to me to be a general mistrust or a sour taste from previous experiences  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:36):**  from other consultants that I have to get over before I can even start to be effective  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:40):**  in a coaching relationship.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:43):**  And I don't know if you found this much or if you've gotten to a point in your professional  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:47):**  role and your reputation that people just kind of come to you specifically for what  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:50):**  you offer.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:53):**  But how have you navigated these expectations from farmers about what a coaching relationship  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:31:58):**  might be and set a different precedent in order to be able to kind of break through  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:03):**  those preconceived notions and work with them on that personal level that you strive for?  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:08):**  Well, I think, again, this comes down to the personal journey.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:13):**  You know, some people might enter into this relationship wanting a more formal consulting  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:20):**  kind of space.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:21):**  And we can do that, but it's going to change.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:26):**  And I haven't found that and maybe it is out there and someone's not saying that I haven't  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:32):**  found that to not create some kind of behavioral changes.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:37):**  You know, so I have done a lot of training in that behavior change space.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:42):**  It's what I find the most fascinating.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:44):**  And so I'm not going to go somewhere if you don't want to go there.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:48):**  There's no, oh, well, we have to go and work on this piece.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:51):**  It's what is an individual's goals?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:53):**  What's going to make them feel like they are successful?  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:32:58):**  And I'm probably in a position where I can choose or I was choosing those clients more  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:04):**  selectively like this certain organizations I won't work with.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:07):**  I'm not going to work with corporations that manage 21 different properties where there's  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:14):**  an entire process that you've got to work through the actually not working with the  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:18):**  individuals.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:20):**  You might find the manager buys in, but the CEOs don't or vice versa.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:26):**  So I'm more selective about this certain types of organizations I'm not going to work with.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:33):**  And you know, I'm very privileged to be able to choose, I guess, who I get to work with.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:37):**  But in those early phases, if someone's expecting me to tell them what to do, they're going  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:43):**  to be in for a little bit of a shock because that's we're not selling product.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:48):**  We've never sold product.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:49):**  I've never taken any kickbacks.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:52):**  It's what is it that's going to make the biggest difference for you here?  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:56):**  And what do you really care about?  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:33:58):**  And what's fascinating is you start to dig into what people really care about.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:03):**  The outcomes can shift.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:05):**  You know, I've had people say, you know, this is my main goal.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:09):**  And you spend a little bit of time with them and you go, no, it's not.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:13):**  You know, I've had one that he wanted to be profitable.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:15):**  And I'm looking at everything that he did.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:17):**  And I'm like, everything that you do on this property is not profitable.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:20):**  Do you actually want to be profitable?  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:22):**  And he was like, no, I have, you know, he was a construction guy.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:25):**  He didn't care.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:27):**  Or another guy who's like, you know, people say things.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:29):**  He's like, you know, I'm really doing this for the family.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:33):**  That man spent every moment of his life to make sure he didn't have to spend time with  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:37):**  the family.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:38):**  So I'm like, are you saying that's actually what you want?  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:41):**  Is that truly what you want?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:44):**  I think just to be a sounding board for that, it can be really confronting.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:49):**  And it's not always pretty.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:51):**  But the changes can be truly remarkable.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:54):**  And that's kind of what I'm committed to.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:55):**  I don't care if you like me or not.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:34:58):**  I'm not here to be, you know, liked.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:01):**  Although it's quite nice that my clients do like me and we form really great relationships.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:05):**  But we might have some pretty straight conversations that are going to be uncomfortable.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:09):**  And I think I'm kind of straight about that when I meet people.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:13):**  Like, if you're not interested in a full structural overhaul and looking at a lot of this stuff,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:20):**  don't come to me.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:21):**  There's other people will tell you what to do.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:24):**  I'm really glad you brought that up because I was actually struggling for a way to find  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:28):**  into that part of the conversation or ask a question around it is that if you're this  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:32):**  involved with somebody's transformational process and I can't imagine I've never met  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:38):**  a grower or a farmer who's not intimately connected on emotional level of the outcome  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:42):**  of their farm business and the health of their land.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:45):**  So you're dealing with really personal stuff here.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:47):**  There's no way that you're not going to have these confrontational moments and be present  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:52):**  for some difficult conversations and growth moments in this journey.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:35:57):**  How have you managed to navigate those with, I assume, people with very different personalities,  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:02):**  backgrounds, traumas, you know, all those things that you've mentioned?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:07):**  And sometimes, you know, I can feel really uncomfortable.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:11):**  I have times felt kind of ill or not slept very well.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:15):**  And what I've discovered probably ninety nine point nine percent of the time, what happened,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:20):**  what was said was perfect.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:21):**  And I've just got to be OK sometimes with that discomfort.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:25):**  I had a client once that he said to me, every time I talk to you, I get a headache.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:30):**  Oh, great.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:32):**  Thanks.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:34):**  And then he said, well, you know, I'm too old to learn this.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:38):**  And I said to him, well, you're my age, buddy.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:40):**  So no, you're not too old to learn this.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:43):**  I said, what is what's happening for you?  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:46):**  What what are times when you do have headaches?  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:49):**  When do you feel overwhelmed?  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:51):**  What came out after I stayed with them for a couple of days is on the second day, he  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:57):**  said.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:36:58):**  I drink too much, and he hadn't said that to anybody, and he had and he wasn't spending  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:05):**  time with the family, he was really overwhelmed by debt.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:09):**  He was really overwhelmed by feeling like he wasn't good enough compared to other people  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:13):**  in his area.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:14):**  So we worked out a strategy and a plan of things that were pretty simple.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:19):**  So I call it the methadone program.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:21):**  What are some of the simple steps that you could take that starts to shift someone from  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:25):**  feeling totally overwhelmed and disempowered?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:28):**  Because it's if you talk to most cropping guys, that's the situation that they're in  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:32):**  right now.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:34):**  And then just find these these little bright spots, these these things that mean you're  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:38):**  not having to overhaul the whole system.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:40):**  You don't have to change your equipment.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:41):**  You don't have to bring in livestock.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:42):**  You don't have to do all of these things.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:45):**  That is the dogma.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:46):**  Sorry, I don't want to go frog.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:51):**  What you what we're looking for is what is just something that's going to get you out  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:37:57):**  of bed today, you know, and that's the basic place that we're in.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:01):**  You know, I'm not a not a psychotherapist, you know, and we don't need to be in that  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:07):**  role.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:08):**  It's just that starting to reflect this.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:10):**  So people see it for themselves.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:11):**  And when he said, I think I drink too much, I didn't say anything.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:15):**  I didn't have to say anything.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:17):**  And from what I've heard, that was two and a half, three years ago, he hasn't drunk since  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:20):**  that day.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:22):**  And it wasn't because I said to him, oh, you've got a drinking problem.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:26):**  He confronted the fact that he'd been hiding from his family and using alcohol as a way  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:31):**  to do that.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:32):**  And the alcohol was what was giving him headaches.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:34):**  Wasn't me.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:36):**  Thanks, buddy.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:37):**  And so, yeah, I think it's a it's an honor to be able to be present to some of the conversations.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:46):**  And it's all because I analyze myself all the time, obviously, to by analyzing people  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:51):**  around me, it's that being able to create that clear space of nonjudgment.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:38:56):**  You know, I spend a lot of time or have living in people's houses, and I might spend a week  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:01):**  or two with people.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:02):**  I do that because the bails come down.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:05):**  They can't pretend to be nice for two weeks.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:07):**  They can't pretend to talk nicely to their kids.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:11):**  At some point, they're going to tell their kids to shut up.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:13):**  You know, like that stuff starts to come out.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:15):**  The patterns start to come out.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:18):**  And it's really been that privilege of being able to stay with people and get to know people  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:23):**  more deeply that they feel like it's safe to say some of these things.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:28):**  And we've spent a lot of time now talking about these internal problems, these struggles  
**[0:39:32-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:32):**  that growers go through and pretty much everyone does.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:35):**  You know, but this is a perspective that we're taking here.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:38):**  But there are also a lot of external challenges which are really out of their control.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:43):**  And things are changing rapidly right now.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:45):**  I can think especially from the European context how much the costs of fertilizers and fuel  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:51):**  are starting to go up because of the Ukrainian conflict.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:39:55):**  And people are facing, you know, a couple of months ahead, potentially a huge collapse  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:00):**  in the financial projections of their business models for this year because of how much they're  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:05):**  just things have changed.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:07):**  And I struggle to tell them that there's something really that they can do in the short term  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:13):**  that's going to change any of this or make it feasible.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:16):**  Do you have much experience with confronting these externalities that are really out of  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:22):**  your control and still being able to offer some glimmer of hope?  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:26):**  Oh, I personally think this is the best thing that's ever happened to agriculture.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:31):**  I just think this is phenomenal because out of things like this comes innovation.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:36):**  You know, you think in 1991 New Zealand removed all farming subsidies and what came out of  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:42):**  that was incredible innovation.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:44):**  New Zealanders, when you deal with a lot of New Zealand farmers, they're business people.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:48):**  They can't afford not to be.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:51):**  So many of our systems are artificially propped up.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:40:54):**  They're propped up by subsidies or they're propped up by the unrealistic cost of fossil  
**[0:41:00-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:00):**  fuels.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:01):**  I mean, what fossil fuels are really worth.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:04):**  And so, OK, here's the issue.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:07):**  We have a we know we have a major challenge with the cost of nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:12):**  Cool.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:13):**  Right.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:14):**  How do we reduce nitrogen fertilizer by 30 to 70 percent with no changes in yield?  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:19):**  We do that by stimulating microbiology and putting some kind of carbon source in with  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:23):**  it.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:24):**  Win win.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:25):**  So I have no concerns about this except for the fact that there's people out there that  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:33):**  don't have the support and that soundboard to bounce around.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:36):**  What are the other options?  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:37):**  Because there are so many, many options.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:39):**  You know, I've been on operations where we have reduced inputs by 70 percent in that  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:44):**  first year through that approach of addressing what were our major limiting factors.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:50):**  So if air if you currently have compaction problems, that's your number one limit to  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:54):**  production.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:55):**  It's not nitrogen.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:56):**  And very rarely have we found it's ever been nitrogen.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:41:59):**  It's not phosphorus.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:01):**  Phosphorus is mediated by microbiology.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:03):**  It's not potassium.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:04):**  Potassium is all about having green growing plants covering that ground and releasing,  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:09):**  you know, potassium in a plant available form.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:12):**  All of it comes down to microbial activity.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:14):**  All of it comes down to soil structure.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:17):**  But people don't know that right now.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:18):**  So, you know, right now it's incredibly terrifying and confronting.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:22):**  And I think a lot of people are going to go under.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:26):**  And that's because we don't have these well-trained extension services people out there.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:30):**  So that's why I'm feeling that urgency.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:32):**  We need to get more and more coaches and consultants and educators out to support this while we  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:40):**  go through the threshold.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:41):**  I mean, we are living in one of the most exciting times in terms of paradigm shifts.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:47):**  That's what's happening.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:48):**  It's very uncomfortable.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:49):**  There's a lot of uncertainty.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:50):**  There's a lot of chaos.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:52):**  There always has been.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:53):**  Like, this is not a new thing.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:55):**  But now we're starting to confront how do we deal with this?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:42:59):**  And how are we better equipped to be able to deal with this?  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:02):**  And it comes from having creative, adaptive thinkers.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:05):**  How do we train and support producers and being able to be creative and adaptive instead  
**[0:43:10-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:10):**  of lose their minds, kill themselves in worst case scenarios, and go into a whole lot of  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:17):**  debt and just be supporting all the external agencies?  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:21):**  What do you think it's going to take to get this level of support out there to the scale  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:25):**  that it's going to need to be in the coming years?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:27):**  Because your program is still quite small, and it's quite high level.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:30):**  There's a lot of people that are just not going to make the cut, and you don't have  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:35):**  the capacity to train the amount of people that are necessary.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:38):**  Where do we start with this ramping up of the necessary trainers?  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:43):**  Well, the idea behind this program is that it works like a ripple effect, because each  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:48):**  of those people then goes on and is affecting their communities in a wider and wider way.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:54):**  And then they potentially become the pyramid scheme.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:43:58):**  They become the next ones to then train the next tier of coaches.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:05):**  My dream is that we can get this happening in Europe, or we can get this happening in  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:09):**  Australasia and South Africa.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:12):**  And then this grows exponentially.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:16):**  But yeah, this is that higher level program.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:19):**  What I'm looking to develop are more online resources that we can have as the runway,  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:25):**  basically, to lead people to create.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:29):**  Let's do a 10-part series on microbiology.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:31):**  Let's do a 10-part series on carbon-based inputs, things like that.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:35):**  So we're looking at doing that right now.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:37):**  But there are other organizations doing some brilliant courses.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:41):**  And I think the online stuff is how we can reach more and more people, and things like  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:45):**  that.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:46):**  Just getting in conversation.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:47):**  I mean, my biggest learning, what's made the hugest difference to what I was doing was  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:44:54):**  really farmer hubs and just getting together as communities and working through something.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:00):**  Even if people do a book club reading of my book, just saying, or they get together and  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:05):**  do an online course as 20 farmers and then go and look at what can we trial here, what  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:11):**  can we try for ourselves?  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:13):**  Because this isn't a top-down approach.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:16):**  This isn't, oh, integrity soils and Nicole have this course, and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:21):**  That's where the fountain of wisdom is coming from, because that's not true.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:26):**  It's about how do we empower each other at a community level, start to do some of this  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:31):**  professional or personal development for ourselves, and work through this as a community-driven  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:37):**  initiative.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:38):**  I don't think this is going to come from some great big government subsidies.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:43):**  Do you see any hope of this type of a curriculum and this level of information being adopted  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:47):**  by academia anytime soon?  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:50):**  Because they seem to be catching up with this, and there are certainly some academics that  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:45:55):**  are really pushing the soil sciences and other things that have been marginalized for a long  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:01):**  time.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:02):**  They're finally starting to receive some of the attention necessary.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:06):**  But at the same time, it doesn't seem to be where the best information and the change  
**[0:46:10-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:10):**  on the farm level is coming from either.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:13):**  Where's that disconnect?  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:16):**  That mindset shift doesn't happen.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:17):**  So it's still based in the current paradigm of academia.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:21):**  It's a conversation we had as a coaching team and with the students is how does education  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:29):**  look different if you don't get a grade?  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:33):**  How does it look different if we design this thinking about a course coming from ecological  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:38):**  principles?  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:39):**  How do we do this as nature designed as opposed to the industrial model of we're going to  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:44):**  churn you through this system and then you get this grade, but it actually doesn't prepare  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:48):**  you for the real world.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:51):**  We have some extension people on this current program and they're like, we teach mindset.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:56):**  We teach all those soil health regenerative practices.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:46:59):**  And one of them said, what I realized was I'd never changed my own mindset.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:04):**  And so those people are driving this training, which is fantastic.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:09):**  And we're going to get practices out there.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:12):**  But practices are what we call the just change.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:14):**  It's just change.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:15):**  It's like growing a mustache and deciding you don't want a mustache anymore and you  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:18):**  shave it off.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:19):**  That's a change.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:20):**  What we're talking about is transformative experiential learning, which is I was once  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:26):**  a caterpillar and now I'm a butterfly.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:28):**  You never get to be the caterpillar again.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:29):**  I'm sorry.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:30):**  You can miss being the caterpillar, but that's it.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:32):**  You're done.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:33):**  So I think it's a totally different distinction than I'm going to teach you how to plant a  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:40):**  cover crop.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:41):**  And this is soil health and soil health is good.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:44):**  Those courses are great.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:45):**  I'm not berating them.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:47):**  But unless we we train that deep ecological principles and philosophy in this, people  
**[0:47:54-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:54):**  will.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:55):**  And this is what we're seeing with cover crops here.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:47:57):**  So currently, I can't think how many million acres are in cover crops in the US.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:03):**  Forty one percent of those are terminated with glyphosate already.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:07):**  And that's worth the innovators.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:09):**  Right now, they are about to roll out an initiative for tens of millions of 10 million acres of  
**[0:48:14-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:14):**  cover crops.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:15):**  I wonder how much glyphosate is going to go on in that process.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:18):**  Right.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:19):**  And it's because we're not addressing the underlying structures.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:23):**  And if we just go through the existing structures, nothing's really going to alter.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:26):**  We're just going to get more of the same, but in a different package.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:31):**  Every practice can be degenerative and every practice could be regenerative.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:34):**  Doesn't matter if that's cattle or cover crops or fertilizer.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:39):**  So that's the distinction.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:41):**  And I think that's kind of what I'm excited about is how do I get hold of some of those  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:46):**  people?  
**[0:48:47-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:47):**  How do we do the training for some of these organizations and get into academia and have  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:51):**  these conversations?  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:54):**  Because that's what needs to happen.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:48:55):**  Now, from a business standpoint, I assume that you're putting this type of mindset change  
**[0:49:00-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:00):**  and your ecological thinking hat on when you approach this from a business mindset for  
**[0:49:06-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:06):**  running a consultancy.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:07):**  And I know that's one of the aspects of your course as well is teaching people how to run  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:11):**  this as a proper business.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:13):**  And I personally have come up with this a lot.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:16):**  And a lot of the other consultants that I've worked with at different levels struggle to  
**[0:49:20-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:20):**  charge for their services and to charge correctly and know how to enter into a business arrangement,  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:26):**  especially with, let's say, farmers are not the people who are best known for being willing  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:31):**  to part with their money and for very good reasons.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:33):**  That's a difficult conversation to start with, even from the beginning.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:38):**  Let's start there.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:39):**  How do you approach that when you enter into new consulting or coaching relationship?  
**[0:49:45-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:45):**  It's a really good point.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:46):**  One part that we put to the side is we need to transform our own money conversation around  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:52):**  our own self-worth.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:55):**  Focus on that, get that shifted.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:49:57):**  But I think what I used to provide and I charged $500 for, I now charge $5,000 for.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:05):**  And it hasn't really altered a huge amount, except my relationship with my self-worth.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:11):**  Like I've always over-delivered and undercharged.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:14):**  That didn't benefit anybody, except I was really stressed and working really hard.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:19):**  And then I'm not being regenerative in myself.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:21):**  And that's part of doing some of this.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:23):**  Like I've done this Centropic Business training that was really cool, based on Buckminster  
**[0:50:29-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:29):**  Fuller's trainings.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:32):**  But thinking about business through a different veil.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:35):**  And it's not just financial, right?  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:39):**  Because if that's putting a cost on my well-being or I'm not sleeping or I'm overworking, that  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:44):**  also, that's a non-renewable resource that time.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:47):**  I can get money.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:48):**  I can't get my time back.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:51):**  But looking at what are the other domains that are not considered economic.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:50:59):**  And that might be spending time with the family.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:01):**  That might be going to the beach.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:04):**  It might be the value of networks and collaboration.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:07):**  How do you put a money figure to that?  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:10):**  And it's the same issue that we're talking about with ecosystem services.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:13):**  I mean, we shouldn't be putting monetary values on what is a life support system.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:19):**  And we shouldn't be doing that same thing in the business.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:21):**  So what does it look like to have a successful business?  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:25):**  And what are areas that I'm really strong in?  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:29):**  And what areas that I'm just pushing the proverbial uphill when I should be outsourcing that?  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:35):**  Someone else can do that kind of stuff.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:36):**  And it wasn't until I brought in Michelle, who's my PA, and I brought her in six years  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:41):**  ago that suddenly I could have a business.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:43):**  Because before then, I was trying to do everything.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:45):**  And to do with my own financials, my own accounting.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:50):**  No.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:51):**  It's not humanly possible to do everything.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:53):**  And I think that's often when we're starting up businesses, we think that we need to do  
**[0:51:57-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:57):**  everything.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:51:58):**  And actually, we've just got to be able to find good people to collaborate with.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:01):**  And that might even be on the social media side.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:03):**  Lots of people hate social media.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:06):**  And I can relate to that.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:09):**  I can collaborate with a group of people where some people love it.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:11):**  It's like, cool.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:12):**  Can we do this as a network instead of thinking that we've got to do everything in separation  
**[0:52:17-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:17):**  and that business needs to be done in separation?  
**[0:52:20-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:20):**  You know, I've always been self-employed.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:24):**  I don't take orders very well from others.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:27):**  I never have.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:28):**  My mom will relate to that.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:30):**  And so I can have an independent business, but that still works as a collaboration.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:38):**  You know, I'm still tied into multiple organizations that or people that I love and value.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:45):**  And I think that really plays into what you were talking earlier about building community  
**[0:52:49-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:49):**  through this.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:50):**  You know, it's not always just around the land and the things that we produce off of  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:53):**  it.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:54):**  It's the professional services that go along with the support that helps the land managers  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:52:58):**  because increasingly, those businesses are extremely integrated.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:03):**  To be a successful farmer now is to be an entrepreneur, a mechanic.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:08):**  You know, I mean, there's so many different hats that you have to wear to run a successful  
**[0:53:13-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:13):**  farm business.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:15):**  And to be able to support others who do some of those things better than you, who like  
**[0:53:19-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:19):**  doing them more than you is not taking away personal power.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:24):**  It's expanding your capacity through collaboration.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:28):**  And to hear that applied to consulting or to any of these other professional services,  
**[0:53:33-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:33):**  not only is it better for you and your independent work, but it offers away from others who perhaps  
**[0:53:41-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:41):**  didn't see a direct way to put their talents and their training into service for this concept  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:48):**  of regeneration.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:49):**  Everybody thinks they have to go and grow a garden or manage animals or, you know, take  
**[0:53:52-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:52):**  care of a landscape.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:53):**  But there are so many support services that are needed in that equation as well.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:53:58):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:00):**  And I think this comes down to your context as well.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:02):**  So one of the things that's the foundation of the Centropic business planning is what  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:08):**  is your evolutionary purpose?  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:09):**  What gets you up in the morning?  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:10):**  What's your why?  
**[0:54:11-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:11):**  You know, what really makes your heart sing?  
**[0:54:14-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:14):**  And does this particular action align with that?  
**[0:54:18-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:18):**  So me doing an accounting software package does not align with my purpose.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:23):**  Like it's a distraction.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:25):**  And I meet producers that want to be like the Joe Salitans of the world.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:29):**  And you know what he's doing is extraordinary.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:32):**  He is extraordinary.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:34):**  But you're going to burn out most people.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:37):**  If you're going to do as a single family, you know, ma and pa, and you're doing chickens,  
**[0:54:43-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:43):**  pigs, turkeys, cattle, and you're direct marketing that and you're trying to manage that and  
**[0:54:48-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:48):**  everything else that comes along with that, you're going to burn out.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:51):**  So which part of that is it that actually works for you?  
**[0:54:55-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:55):**  Why do you want to do all those different pieces?  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:54:57):**  And maybe you need to be an educational facility instead, or find another way to make that  
**[0:55:03-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:03):**  work if that's what really makes your heart sing is having 10 different enterprises.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:07):**  Cool.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:08):**  You're probably going to struggle financially, just saying.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:12):**  And not saying that some people haven't been successful with it.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:14):**  They are.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:15):**  Those people often don't sleep, I've noticed.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:18):**  They burn out and go in a very different direction after a set number of years.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:23):**  Yeah, they go really quiet.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:25):**  What do I do with quiet?  
**[0:55:27-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:27):**  But find your why, you know, and for a lot of people is, you know, they just want to  
**[0:55:34-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:34):**  be deeply connected to nature and to animal husbandry.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:39):**  It's gorgeous or grow really, really top quality food.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:43):**  Cool.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:44):**  Just there's some choices to be made sometimes.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:47):**  And that's part of where coach can be really great as you can just bounce all these different  
**[0:55:50-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:50):**  things around.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:51):**  And what would it be like if you didn't have that?  
**[0:55:53-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:53):**  Or what would it be like if you did have this?  
**[0:55:55-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:55):**  And what's that going to take?  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:55:58):**  And just getting just having a reality check, I think is really important.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:01):**  And it's the same when we're consulting.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:03):**  What is the reality check?  
**[0:56:05-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:05):**  I was very lucky in my first 10 years is that I got a really great contract, a worm farming  
**[0:56:11-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:11):**  contract that basically supported me with a full time income.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:17):**  And it was a part time job.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:19):**  And so I could go and spend most of my time researching.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:22):**  I love research.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:24):**  And so I'm just researching and researching.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:26):**  And I feel very, very lucky that I got that opportunity.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:30):**  And I feel like more of us need those kind of opportunities or there is a lot of angel  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:36):**  investment.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:37):**  There's a lot of internships out there right now.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:39):**  You know, if I could take some of those internships now that I mean, it's too hard once you've  
**[0:56:44-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:44):**  got your business going, but there's some brilliant places to just go and learn from  
**[0:56:48-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:48):**  and immerse yourself and swim in it and figure out what is it that actually you really enjoy.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:54):**  Do you just want to grow mushrooms?  
**[0:56:55-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:55):**  Cool.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:56):**  Do that.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:56:57):**  But yeah, I think that would be my advice if I could go back in time.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:02):**  Well, I really like your example of having that little side gig that enabled you to do  
**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:06):**  some of the other things that you're even more passionate about.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:09):**  I've got well, I've done that a few times in the past and I've got friends who are currently  
**[0:57:13-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:13):**  doing it.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:14):**  I know one actually who I just came to visit here in Portugal and he's running a fermented  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:18):**  food business with his partner so that he could take two years off and write the book  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:23):**  all about Portuguese plants that he's always wanted to write, you know, and there was never  
**[0:57:27-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:27):**  any financial incentive in that, but he found a way to make it work.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:31):**  And, you know, he's living his best life because of it.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:35):**  And we don't always do something because it's a financial return.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:38):**  Like I didn't write the book that I wrote because I thought it would be a financial  
**[0:57:42-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:42):**  return.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:43):**  It has been, which been a huge surprise and don't believe the hype that if you write a  
**[0:57:49-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:49):**  book, you're not going to make like I could actually make a living off just the book,  
**[0:57:53-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:53):**  which is amazing to me.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:56):**  And wasn't what I thought it would do.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:57:58):**  But that took two years of just having to do a few gigs on the side so I could focus  
**[0:58:03-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:03):**  on doing that.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:04):**  And I think we have a society that values things like being really busy or like self-sacrifice  
**[0:58:11-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:11):**  and just all of these really negative, I think, views when book writing for me was just an  
**[0:58:18-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:18):**  absolute pleasure.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:19):**  Like it wasn't stressful.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:20):**  I stayed on different ranches, had these beautiful views.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:23):**  It was sublime.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:24):**  And in lots of ways, I missed that process.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:27):**  I'm going to do it again because it was just I'm just going to check out of all the society  
**[0:58:31-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:31):**  and go and write.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:32):**  And I highly recommend it.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:33):**  It's so fun.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:35):**  And sometimes you need those changes of practice or of time spent in order to make the next  
**[0:58:41-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:41):**  step in the evolution of your career, your personal journey, whatever it might be.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:45):**  Like, you know, we're not machines.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:47):**  We can't just continue down one path and hope that it's going to bring us everything that  
**[0:58:50-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:50):**  we might be able to grow into.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:52):**  We're never going to reach our full potential if we kind of limit ourselves in that way.  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:58-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:58:59):**  And be OK with that.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:00):**  I think sometimes we are going to work our asses off.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:04):**  Very few people get to where they get to without working pretty hard.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:10):**  But like, I still really value sleep.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:13):**  I will never compromise on sleep.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:15):**  It is a non-negotiable.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:16):**  So, you know, I'm not going to work through the knife or anything.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:22):**  And I think that's part of what keeps me really healthy is not not doing things like that,  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:27):**  but making sure that I am not compromising my health because I have all sorts of autoimmune  
**[0:59:32-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:32):**  issues.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:33):**  So I don't mess with it.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:34):**  But I think you shouldn't have to have an autoimmune to like kind of prioritize some  
**[0:59:37-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:37):**  of your non-negotiables around health.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:39):**  Yeah, very well said.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:41):**  I think all of us could use that advice a little more.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:43):**  Like you said, with so much of the working culture, prioritizing or even incentivizing  
**[0:59:49-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:49):**  burnouts and overworking yourself and it becomes a part of the culture.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:52):**  But as we established earlier on as well, like time is the really only non-renewable  
**[0:59:59-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:59:59):**  resource there.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:00):**  And if that is not valued appropriately, everything else is not going to mean as much because  
**[1:00:06-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:06):**  it isn't just time.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:07):**  It's also quality of time.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:08):**  Right.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:09):**  And how much quality of your time are you going to have if you don't have health?  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:14):**  And so much of that is connected with these basics that we take for granted and try and  
**[1:00:18-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:18):**  supplement our way out of the essentials like sleep.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:21):**  You know, but there's no there's no substitute.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:26):**  And in that valuation of time, I actually want to go back real quickly about entering  
**[1:00:30-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:30):**  into these relationships of coaching and consulting that perhaps are are not what someone is expecting  
**[1:00:37-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:37):**  at the beginning.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:38):**  Right.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:39):**  You were talking about how you start the conversation about what it means to charge adequately for  
**[1:00:43-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:43):**  your services and value your own time and make sure that that is respected throughout  
**[1:00:48-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:48):**  the journey.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:49):**  But you're also making a pitch that I would imagine most people are not super accustomed  
**[1:00:55-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:55):**  to being approached with, which is a longer term journey.  
**[1:00:58-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:58):**  Right.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:00:59):**  It takes a while to really see results out of management practice changes in an ecosystem.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:04):**  It takes a while to change your own mindset.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:07):**  And if they want to see results, they're not going to be able to get them from recipes  
**[1:01:10-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:10):**  like so many people are used to getting from, let's say, extension agents or conventional  
**[1:01:14-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:14):**  consulting.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:16):**  And how do you approach that conversation?  
**[1:01:18-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:18):**  How do you get people ready for entering into a journey with you?  
**[1:01:22-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:22):**  Yeah, and in a lot of ways, that is a huge barrier because industrial agriculture has  
**[1:01:28-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:28):**  set us up for this one, two, three, and the answer is two hundred and fifty kilos.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:33):**  That's all you need to do.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:35):**  And the challenge with this is there is no one answer and.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:41):**  We need to be able to work through that and find those creative solutions often what I  
**[1:01:48-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:48):**  do with people.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:51):**  People don't generally come to me unless they're interested in this.  
**[1:01:55-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:01:55):**  So I'm not kind of finding I get a lot of those kind of conversations.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:01):**  And perhaps it happened when I first started out.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:03):**  And now I don't really remember.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:04):**  I've always been a very, very reluctant consultant.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:08):**  It's been the last thing that I wanted to do my core, the core of this business has  
**[1:02:11-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:11):**  always been education.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:13):**  So I've run workshops since 2003.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:15):**  You know, and if you're looking for a way to let people know what you're up to, a workshop  
**[1:02:21-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:21):**  is the way to go.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:22):**  And sharing case studies, sharing examples, sharing and through that veil of behavioral  
**[1:02:29-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:29):**  change.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:30):**  So what are some of the stepping stones?  
**[1:02:33-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:33):**  How do we break it down?  
**[1:02:34-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:34):**  How do we what we call script those critical moves to make it more accessible for producers?  
**[1:02:41-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:41):**  So my goal is not that I'm going to get hired by these people, but that they're going to  
**[1:02:46-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:46):**  go out and take some new actions and see some results for themselves.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:50):**  And then if they were to circle background, and sometimes it might take a couple years  
**[1:02:54-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:54):**  of thinking and working through stuff that they might then give me a call and they're  
**[1:02:58-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:58):**  then ready.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:59):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:00):**  So I think it's a slightly different context than being a consultant or a coach and you're  
**[1:03:05-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:05):**  doing that cold turkey like that is really hard.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:09):**  And especially because I was really clear from early on, I was never going to take money  
**[1:03:13-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:13):**  from a company.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:14):**  I was, you know, companies have paid me to do workshops, but I've never, I've never taken  
**[1:03:20-1:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:20):**  any kickbacks.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:22):**  And so that makes that a big financial stretch.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:25):**  But there's such a need for education right now, that I think if you did want to become  
**[1:03:31-1:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:31):**  a culture consultant, getting trained in some basic adult education, public speaking, or  
**[1:03:38-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:38):**  facilitation, all of those kind of base foundational courses, and start teaching because the world  
**[1:03:45-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:45):**  needs it.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:46):**  People need to hear what you have to share.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:49):**  And that might develop coaching or consultancy for you.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:53):**  I think, yeah, if we're coming in cold turkey, then really you need to be working for an  
**[1:03:57-1:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:57):**  established consultancy company.  
**[1:03:58-1:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:58):**  Otherwise, it's going to be a lot of hard work, like my heart would go out to you.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:02):**  That's that's a challenge.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:03):**  That's really interesting to hear because that's been my approach as well.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:07):**  I got into it to do the workshops and to translate this information into a more digestible form  
**[1:04:12-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:12):**  and kind of condense it so that people could go off and take action with it, which is also  
**[1:04:16-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:16):**  the motivation behind the podcast.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:19):**  And consulting and designing sort of came as a result of people wanting to go further  
**[1:04:23-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:23):**  than what they could learn in a week long course.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:26):**  And so with that approach of purely putting the emphasis on education, whether that's  
**[1:04:33-1:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:33):**  individually with people or to a group, how do you approach that?  
**[1:04:36-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:36):**  How do you structure your workshops and make sure that it's not overwhelming, it's digestible,  
**[1:04:44-1:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:44):**  but it's also enough of a change in perspective that they don't just use it as a recipe  
**[1:04:49-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:49):**  which everyone is kind of tending towards anyway.  
**[1:04:51-1:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:51):**  Yeah.  
**[1:04:52-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:52):**  And that's OK.  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:53):**  You know, if they use it as a recipe and it gets them starting, cool.  
**[1:04:58-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:58):**  That's awesome.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:04:59):**  There's nothing wrong with that.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:00):**  But yeah, thinking of workshops, I don't spend too long focusing on what's not working.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:06):**  Things like climate crisis or biodiversity collapse and oh my God, Armageddon.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:13):**  None of that's very empowering.  
**[1:05:15-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:15):**  It doesn't make a difference in terms of people's behaviors.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:17):**  In fact, it does the opposite.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:19):**  People often just hunker down and go, well, the world's screwed anyway, so let's just  
**[1:05:23-1:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:23):**  floor it.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:24):**  This is we're just going to go out with a bang or people become kind of attached to  
**[1:05:32-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:32):**  reactionary approach and that might be becoming a vegan.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:37):**  Sorry, vegans.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:38):**  But, you know, if we've got to be looking at in terms of how can we be proactive about  
**[1:05:45-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:45):**  these measures that we're taking?  
**[1:05:46-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:46):**  And so my programs are very much focused on the proactiveness.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:50):**  All right.  
**[1:05:51-1:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:51):**  We can all watch the media.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:52):**  We can all feel like the world's coming to an end.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:54):**  And that's cool.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:55):**  You know, get some survival skills if that's what rings your bells.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:05:59):**  But during my programs is very much about what are the things that we can currently  
**[1:06:03-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:03):**  do?  
**[1:06:04-1:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:04):**  What is the cost of where we're currently going and what is probably almost inevitable  
**[1:06:09-1:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:09):**  outcome if we don't shift our practices?  
**[1:06:13-1:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:13):**  Just even just from the practice side of things.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:15):**  Right. What are we currently seeing?  
**[1:06:16-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:16):**  What are the soil losses?  
**[1:06:18-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:18):**  What are the most powerful things I can do?  
**[1:06:20-1:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:20):**  I find in the classes to do that slaking test, which is look at how much soil you're losing.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:25):**  So get people to bring their own soils.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:27):**  And I've had microscopes that have hooked up to a computer and people can see their  
**[1:06:31-1:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:31):**  own soil alive.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:33):**  And suddenly what's just this, you know, concept like fairy dust and unicorn horns becomes  
**[1:06:39-1:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:39):**  holy.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:40):**  That's my soil.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:41):**  That's my nematode.  
**[1:06:42-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:42):**  That that soil is alive.  
**[1:06:43-1:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:43):**  So I'm always looking for games, keeping people slightly uncomfortable.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:50):**  Like maybe I'm a masochist.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:51):**  No, it's a sadist.  
**[1:06:52-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:52):**  I'm a sadist because I like just keep people slightly off their normal comfort because  
**[1:06:58-1:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:06:58):**  that's where the learning is.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:01):**  You know, confronting some of these things that are hard to do.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:04):**  That is where the learning is, you know, and I came from a very conventional sheep and  
**[1:07:08-1:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:08):**  beef community and it was hard.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:12):**  Right.  
**[1:07:13-1:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:13):**  I was a female consultant at the time, so I can't say I did a lot of work in my local  
**[1:07:17-1:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:17):**  area, but I'm used to working with some of those crotchety, grumpy old white guys and  
**[1:07:25-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:25):**  they don't scare me.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:27):**  And inside of them mostly is just this big squishy teddy bear.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:30):**  So finding ways to make it safe.  
**[1:07:35-1:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:35):**  Like I've done this thing.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:36):**  It's called the worm dance.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:37):**  It's hilarious.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:38):**  So you get people like a group of six people shoulder to shoulder with their big gum boots  
**[1:07:44-1:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:44):**  and we stamp the ground.  
**[1:07:45-1:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:45):**  And then I have on my phone like this song that sounds like an Egyptian snake charmer  
**[1:07:49-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:49):**  and we play the song and these guys stamp their boots.  
**[1:07:52-1:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:52):**  You want to watch a bunch of grown men get down on the ground and squeal like little  
**[1:07:56-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:07:56):**  girls as they watch these worms come out of the ground like worms will eject right out.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:00):**  It's so cool.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:02):**  And so there's a playfulness that I enjoy that I bring to classes that I think there's  
**[1:08:10-1:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:10):**  an aspect of society.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:11):**  You're not allowed to be playful anymore.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:12):**  You're not allowed to have fun.  
**[1:08:13-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:13):**  You're not allowed to use coloring and pencils and squeal.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:18):**  You know, like and for some of these, like I think it's some of the communities I've  
**[1:08:24-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:24):**  gone into and made them do like these really fun things that they've possibly never had  
**[1:08:31-1:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:31):**  an experience like that before.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:32):**  And it sticks with them.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:34):**  And I hear years later, people are like, you know, I remember that.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:37):**  And then we did this and this and this.  
**[1:08:39-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:39):**  That wouldn't have been possible, I don't think, without injecting the humor and the  
**[1:08:43-1:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:43):**  fun.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:44):**  And, you know, we're here for such a short time.  
**[1:08:47-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:47):**  It's stopping so bloomin' significant.  
**[1:08:50-1:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:50):**  That's a good way of putting it.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:52):**  And it sort of fills in one of the gaps that I've struggled with a lot and seen others  
**[1:08:56-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:56):**  in this line of work do as well.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:08:58):**  When it comes to advertising and get the word out about what it is that you can offer, the  
**[1:09:03-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:03):**  skills that you can bring, and the solutions that you can help someone to achieve, teaching  
**[1:09:08-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:08):**  is one of the most effective and integrity-based ways of getting the word out there.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:15):**  Because everything else often seems really ingenuine, right?  
**[1:09:21-1:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:21):**  Pumping out messages on social media or putting money into just becoming more visible.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:26):**  I know everybody that I've worked with closely just cringe at the thought of that.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:32):**  And don't get me wrong, there are integrity ways of using those tools as well.  
**[1:09:36-1:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:36):**  But by starting off with those connections, giving people an entrance or a window into  
**[1:09:42-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:42):**  this world of learning and a new mindset is a great way to build the type of connections  
**[1:09:48-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:48):**  that later can become consulting agreements or however you structure it.  
**[1:09:55-1:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:55):**  How have you found that and have you ever struggled or tried, I guess, other ways of  
**[1:09:59-1:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:09:59):**  getting the word out?  
**[1:10:00-1:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:00):**  Yeah, it's such a good point.  
**[1:10:03-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:03):**  Two things.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:04):**  So the first class I ever ran was in 2003.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:07):**  And I used to be terrified of talking in front of people.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:11):**  I just want to say that that was a really big deal for me to overcome.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:16):**  And I think what enabled me to overcome that was getting connected with my purpose.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:22):**  Like just being really clear that this was information that needed to get out.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:26):**  And my concern at the time was the amount I was working in avocados was the amount of  
**[1:10:31-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:31):**  phytophthora disease, the chemicals that avocado producers were using.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:35):**  And so I taught mycorrhizae and carbon.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:37):**  That's the first class I ever done.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:40):**  I didn't know a huge amount about mycorrhizae and carbon, but I knew more than what the  
**[1:10:45-1:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:45):**  avocado growers that I was surrounded by knew.  
**[1:10:49-1:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:49):**  So I didn't have to be, hey, I'm the huge expert in this.  
**[1:10:52-1:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:52):**  It was more, this is really interesting.  
**[1:10:54-1:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:54):**  This is something that I've come across.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:10:55):**  I think it would be of real value and save you guys a whole lot of money.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:01):**  And it was going to feel like I was going to vomit for the whole time.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:05):**  But I think if you feel disingenuous or a lack of integrity or you're feeling ill around  
**[1:11:12-1:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:12):**  marketing side of things, don't do that.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:15):**  Because people that watch or listen or read that or see some of the, I mean, some of the  
**[1:11:19-1:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:19):**  reels on Instagram, stop it, stop with the dancing dog and the voiceovers.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:26):**  That's not who you are.  
**[1:11:27-1:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:27):**  And it just comes across as weird to stop it.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:30):**  You know, share your own voice.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:33):**  You know, there are some funny things out there for sure.  
**[1:11:35-1:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:35):**  But just get back to who are you and you know, what is it that's unique about what you have  
**[1:11:42-1:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:42):**  to offer?  
**[1:11:44-1:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:44):**  You know, and I'm not very good on social media.  
**[1:11:46-1:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:46):**  Like I love talking.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:47):**  I love doing workshops, but there's something about like being, it's not my thing.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:54):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:55-1:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:11:55):**  And we've never really spent a lot on advertising.

**[1:12:43-1:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:12:43):**  Cool.  
**[1:12:44-1:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:12:44):**  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**[1:12:46-1:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:12:46):**  Now, I want to switch gears one more time here and start to look at this equation from  
**[1:12:51-1:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:12:51):**  the perspective of a grower or a farmer who is looking for support as they're entering  
**[1:12:57-1:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:12:57):**  into a new phase and trying to change the trajectory of the health of their land and  
**[1:13:02-1:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:02):**  their businesses.  
**[1:13:03-1:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:03):**  And like we talked about earlier, a lot of them have become soured on relationships with  
**[1:13:08-1:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:08):**  consultants because of past experience and the lack of results.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:12):**  But there are ways that I've found that they can evaluate the efficacy and the competence  
**[1:13:18-1:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:18):**  of the people that are offering services in their area.  
**[1:13:22-1:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:22):**  What would you say are some of the things that you would look for as, you know, absolutely  
**[1:13:27-1:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:27):**  essential or red flags that you shouldn't enter into that agreement when looking at  
**[1:13:31-1:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:31):**  it from the other side of the equation?  
**[1:13:33-1:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:33):**  Well, I'd be interested to hear what what the things are for you.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:38):**  For me, they, I want to go and talk to the people that they're working with.  
**[1:13:45-1:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:45):**  Right.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:46):**  So if you're looking at engaging a consultant, then ask them, you know, who are some people  
**[1:13:52-1:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:52):**  in my local area?  
**[1:13:53-1:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:53):**  Is there someone I can go and talk to?  
**[1:13:55-1:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:55):**  Make sure that they're not, that they don't have commercial interests with each other.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:13:58):**  This is what I find a lot.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:01):**  That actually that client might actually be a shareholder in their company.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:04):**  So you should need to ask that.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:07):**  Yeah, and just and I don't know, get in conversation and just see is this is this someone who's  
**[1:14:13-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:13):**  going to expand you or is this someone who's just got the answer?  
**[1:14:17-1:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:17):**  Yeah, but what what do you what do you feel?  
**[1:14:21-1:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:21):**  First of all, I always recommend to people that they get very clear about what they're  
**[1:14:26-1:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:26):**  going to a consultant for.  
**[1:14:28-1:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:28):**  I think getting that clear for yourself as to like, what are the results that you want  
**[1:14:33-1:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:33):**  from coaching or from advice is really important because it's going to determine whether you're  
**[1:14:40-1:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:40):**  going into a long term relationship where you want just some of them to solve a problem  
**[1:14:45-1:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:45):**  for you.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:47):**  And also be very clear about the communication of where you're currently at.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:52):**  Right.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:53):**  I've gone into some of these consultancies and I feel like I have struggled to charge  
**[1:14:59-1:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:14:59):**  for the initial consultations because we spend all of the time where the person is just unable  
**[1:15:04-1:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:04):**  to give me the information where I can even understand what the problem is.  
**[1:15:08-1:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:08):**  And so by getting clear on that, you can jump the steps forward.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:13):**  And then, you know, based on what they're offering, if it's a consultancy for soil health  
**[1:15:18-1:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:18):**  to improve soil health and they come out to your land and they don't bring a shovel that  
**[1:15:24-1:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:24):**  I would call a red.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:25):**  Yeah.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:26):**  Get back in your car.  
**[1:15:27-1:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:27):**  Yeah.  
**[1:15:28-1:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:28):**  And I actually I've tailed some some consultancies with professionals from other places.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:36):**  Actually, I can think of one recently where there's a neighbor of mine who's an organic  
**[1:15:41-1:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:41):**  hazelnut farmer and the region is kind of known for that.  
**[1:15:45-1:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:45):**  And, you know, I told him that I was starting to get into some of this.  
**[1:15:48-1:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:48):**  I don't really have experience with hazelnut farming.  
**[1:15:50-1:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:50):**  And he told me that he was bringing in a consultant and that if I was interested, I could come  
**[1:15:54-1:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:54):**  along with them.  
**[1:15:55-1:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:55):**  And that's when it kind of clicked with me because they were talking about all this stuff  
**[1:15:58-1:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:15:58):**  like the percentage of organic matter around in different fields and whether it's wet or  
**[1:16:03-1:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:03):**  not.  
**[1:16:04-1:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:04):**  He never once dug in the soil.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:06):**  No.  
**[1:16:07-1:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:07):**  And OK, I'm sure there was a lot of value that he was able to give in some other ways.  
**[1:16:11-1:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:11):**  But to me, that was like that was, you know, is this is the conversation or are you actually  
**[1:16:16-1:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:16):**  trying to gather data from the space?  
**[1:16:18-1:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:18):**  And we spent a good two hours going all around the different fields.  
**[1:16:22-1:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:22):**  We did look at some of like the they were having problems with a fungal disease that  
**[1:16:27-1:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:27):**  was ruining the flowers here in early spring.  
**[1:16:31-1:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:31):**  But they were talking about, you know, what sort of chemical regimen you're on and whatnot.  
**[1:16:35-1:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:35):**  And to me, there was just there was a missing part in the diagnostics before making recommendations.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:42):**  But that is the old model.  
**[1:16:43-1:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:43):**  Right.  
**[1:16:44-1:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:44):**  And that's the model that I really it's it's met its end.  
**[1:16:49-1:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:49):**  Right.  
**[1:16:50-1:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:50):**  And that's what the consequences of their model is, which is that those consultants  
**[1:16:53-1:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:53):**  are doing well financially and their producers are not.  
**[1:16:57-1:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:16:57):**  The waterways are under pressure and we've got climate climate variability because our  
**[1:17:01-1:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:01):**  lands are basically destroyed.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:05):**  But I think asking the question of or clarifying what results you want.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:10):**  Sometimes I find people are not at the source of this or they're looking for something that  
**[1:17:16-1:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:16):**  might actually not be their true what they really, really, really want.  
**[1:17:21-1:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:21):**  So part of that conversation, you know, and sometimes we say things and it's not necessarily  
**[1:17:26-1:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:26):**  our truth as well.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:27):**  And that's why there is like the coaching process does take a bit to kind of pull this  
**[1:17:32-1:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:32):**  out.  
**[1:17:33-1:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:33):**  You know, we have a questionnaire that we send out to people when we were consulting  
**[1:17:38-1:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:38):**  and we would follow that up in a call before we'd go out to a property.  
**[1:17:43-1:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:43):**  And I find you have to ask a question maybe three or four times before you actually get  
**[1:17:47-1:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:47):**  to what that that answer was.  
**[1:17:49-1:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:49):**  So it's being able to be patient because what comes up first might just be this is the reaction  
**[1:17:55-1:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:55):**  or this is what I need to say because I got to look good or, you know, I don't necessarily  
**[1:17:59-1:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:59):**  want people to know that the whole system's falling apart.  
**[1:18:03-1:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:03):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:04-1:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:04):**  But I think it.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:06):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:07-1:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:07):**  And if you've got someone that is a soil consultant, they are going to have a shovel.  
**[1:18:11-1:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:11):**  That would be a no brainer.  
**[1:18:12-1:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:12):**  I would afford.  
**[1:18:13-1:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:13):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:14-1:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:14):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:15-1:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:15):**  And, you know, there might be an indicator of whether this person is going to start you  
**[1:18:18-1:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:18):**  on the journey that you're looking to get into or if they just make you comfortable  
**[1:18:21-1:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:21):**  with what you're used to.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:23):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:24-1:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:24):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:25-1:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:25):**  You want to feel a little pushed if you just got affirmation that you're doing a really  
**[1:18:27-1:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:27):**  good job.  
**[1:18:28-1:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:28):**  And I have seen that with some of the big fancy pants consultants that are around.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:34):**  They're just patting the clients on the back.  
**[1:18:36-1:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:36):**  Oh, you're doing such a great job.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:38):**  No, no, that's that's.  
**[1:18:41-1:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:41):**  If you want that, that's cool.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:43):**  I wouldn't be paying big bucks for that.  
**[1:18:45-1:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:45):**  You know, that's great that they make you feel good.  
**[1:18:48-1:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:48):**  And then I feel really bad because I kind of come along and burst their bubbles and  
**[1:18:51-1:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:51):**  go seriously.  
**[1:18:52-1:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:52):**  You've been working with this guy for 30 years and this is the outcome.  
**[1:18:56-1:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:18:56):**  You know, my goal is that you're not going to need us like that's kind of how we come  
**[1:19:00-1:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:00):**  at this.  
**[1:19:01-1:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:01):**  That this is a process where within two or three years, you're not going to not going  
**[1:19:05-1:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:05):**  to require our services because we've deepened that ability to observe for yourself and ask  
**[1:19:13-1:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:13):**  those questions for yourself so that you're not looking for an external source.  
**[1:19:17-1:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:17):**  You know, we're always learning.  
**[1:19:18-1:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:18):**  So I feel like we're always offering something different if people want to kind of stay on  
**[1:19:23-1:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:23):**  the journey with us.  
**[1:19:24-1:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:24):**  But it's our ability to observe and to see and ask questions.  
**[1:19:29-1:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:29):**  Keep asking those why questions, you know.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:31):**  Yeah, see, that was the last one I was going to mention of like the criteria I would tell  
**[1:19:35-1:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:35):**  a farmer to go into is if the other person has an exit strategy because otherwise they  
**[1:19:39-1:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:39):**  may just be, you know, throwing the hook out there to get you on an infinite pay loop,  
**[1:19:45-1:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:45):**  you know.  
**[1:19:47-1:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:47):**  And if they're doing their job very well, obviously there are some exceptions to this.  
**[1:19:53-1:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:53):**  There are certain journeys where you're going to need assistance along the way.  
**[1:19:55-1:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:19:55):**  Let's say they're a financial manager and you have no ambition of being your own financial  
**[1:20:00-1:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:00):**  manager.  
**[1:20:01-1:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:01):**  Right.  
**[1:20:02-1:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:02):**  But if you're really working with someone who has a priority on setting a new mindset,  
**[1:20:07-1:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:07):**  potentially they're getting you on a track where you are no longer dependent on regular  
**[1:20:12-1:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:12):**  assistance and maybe they check in once in a while.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:15):**  And so, yeah, that's another one that I found.  
**[1:20:17-1:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:17):**  And then that was definitely the case of back when I was working in natural building and  
**[1:20:20-1:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:20):**  stuff, too, because if they're coming back and constantly having to fix things, well,  
**[1:20:25-1:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:25):**  yeah, totally.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:27):**  OK, well, then so.  
**[1:20:30-1:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:30):**  As we kind of start to wrap this up, what advice would you give people who are passionate  
**[1:20:35-1:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:35):**  about regenerative agriculture?  
**[1:20:37-1:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:37):**  Like you said, you know, it's a bit of a fad right now, but there are a lot of people who  
**[1:20:39-1:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:39):**  have a genuine interest in seeing our food systems change and for land managers to assist  
**[1:20:46-1:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:46):**  them on a journey to get the ecosystem processes back on track and moving in a different trajectory  
**[1:20:52-1:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:52):**  or genuine about seeing this through in the long run.  
**[1:20:55-1:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:20:55):**  What are some of the steps, the skills, the places to start to get you on this journey  
**[1:21:00-1:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:00):**  as well?  
**[1:21:01-1:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:01):**  Where would you start?  
**[1:21:02-1:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:02):**  For me?  
**[1:21:03-1:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:03):**  Going and doing some of that personal development work, get that out of the way, because it's  
**[1:21:09-1:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:09):**  going to make it so much clearer about what is actually your priority.  
**[1:21:13-1:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:13):**  You know, if something is a fad, you're going to see that and then you'll be like, oh, I'm  
**[1:21:17-1:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:17):**  not going to stick with that.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:18):**  But actually, I want to restore ecosystem services, go and do it in terms of go and  
**[1:21:23-1:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:23):**  stay with people.  
**[1:21:26-1:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:26):**  I certainly have valued, I think, every single piece of education that I've ever done, you  
**[1:21:31-1:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:31):**  know, from ecology to soil science to microbiology to education, organizational learning.  
**[1:21:38-1:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:38):**  So it's really, what would be your dream?  
**[1:21:42-1:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:42):**  You know, is it if you want to get into education or facilitation, two very different roles,  
**[1:21:49-1:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:49):**  but take a look at that.  
**[1:21:51-1:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:51):**  If you're wanting to be the producer that makes the most extraordinary food in the world,  
**[1:21:56-1:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:21:56):**  go and find those people and stay with them and learn from people that are in it.  
**[1:22:02-1:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:02):**  Yeah, I think that's probably some of the best places to start this.  
**[1:22:07-1:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:07):**  And just like the soil, you know, there's no one way to do this.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:11):**  But the better that we are at observing and listening and learning, then the better we  
**[1:22:17-1:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:17):**  set up for anything.  
**[1:22:18-1:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:18):**  So you might decide that you do want to be that software developer in the Silicon Valley.  
**[1:22:23-1:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:23):**  Cool.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:24):**  You now have different tools.  
**[1:22:25-1:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:25):**  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:26):**  And like you said, the personal work is often the most overlooked.  
**[1:22:31-1:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:31):**  You know, it's not necessarily what people associate with ecological work, soil health  
**[1:22:37-1:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:37):**  and whatnot, but it is a huge tool and a lot of assistance for anything you're doing in  
**[1:22:42-1:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:42):**  life, whether it's consultancy or like you said, if you decide after that process to  
**[1:22:46-1:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:46):**  go into an entirely different direction.  
**[1:22:49-1:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:49):**  And where can people reach out to you and learn more about the CREATE program for training  
**[1:22:54-1:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:54):**  consultants?  
**[1:22:57-1:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:22:57):**  So we have a number of courses on our website.  
**[1:23:00-1:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:00):**  So integritysoils.co.nz is the website.  
**[1:23:04-1:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:04):**  But we have some foundational soil courses, online courses, as well as CREATE.  
**[1:23:09-1:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:09):**  And then there's a whole page on CREATE so you can get a sense of what does the program  
**[1:23:14-1:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:14):**  offer and what are some of the criteria.  
**[1:23:17-1:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:17):**  There are some people coming over from the UK for this one.  
**[1:23:20-1:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:20):**  It is CREATE.  
**[1:23:21-1:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:21):**  You need to be able to come to two of the classes in person.  
**[1:23:25-1:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:25):**  So you do need to get to the US.  
**[1:23:28-1:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:28):**  But I feel like there is a little bit of urgency perhaps to get some Europeans over twice.  
**[1:23:35-1:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:35):**  So that, yeah, potentially they could be coaches on the next one we do in Europe, which would  
**[1:23:39-1:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:39):**  be amazing.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:41):**  Do you have dates or thought for when that might be or where it might be?  
**[1:23:45-1:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:45):**  No, just waiting to see when COVID restrictions lift.  
**[1:23:50-1:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:50):**  I'm not traveling in a segregated world.  
**[1:23:53-1:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:53):**  So until that settles down.  
**[1:23:55-1:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:55):**  Yeah.  
**[1:23:56-1:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:56):**  Well, please keep us posted.  
**[1:23:58-1:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:23:58):**  I'm sure there's a lot of people in our network who would jump at that.  
**[1:24:01-1:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:01):**  Yeah, that would be amazing.  
**[1:24:02-1:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:02):**  Thank you.  
**[1:24:03-1:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:03):**  And so you mentioned too that you're hoping to write a book again someday.  
**[1:24:08-1:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:08):**  So just before you go, what would that book be about?  
**[1:24:11-1:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:11):**  Is it on the horizon at all?  
**[1:24:13-1:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:13):**  It's on the horizon.  
**[1:24:14-1:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:14):**  Got a couple of chapters already kind of planned in my head.  
**[1:24:19-1:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:19):**  More on these themes of what the first book was, what are successful producers doing and  
**[1:24:25-1:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:25):**  looking in some of the different industries.  
**[1:24:28-1:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:28):**  So vegetable production and dairy.  
**[1:24:33-1:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:33):**  I'm very grateful for the life I get to live and the people I get to meet.  
**[1:24:36-1:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:36):**  I mean, there's some incredible...  
**[1:24:38-1:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:38):**  Everyone has a story.  
**[1:24:39-1:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:39):**  So to be able to tell some people's stories through that lens of what is it that's bringing  
**[1:24:45-1:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:45):**  more vibrant life to these landscapes and to families and to communities.  
**[1:24:52-1:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:52):**  There's so much to share out there, I feel, of stories that haven't really been shared.  
**[1:24:58-1:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:24:58):**  And you can read a book and it might be about, I don't know, squirrel farming or forestry.  
**[1:25:05-1:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:05):**  And it doesn't really matter what that sector is.  
**[1:25:07-1:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:07):**  It's the pieces that resonate with ourselves, I guess.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:11):**  That, oh, I can take a piece of that and a piece of that, even though there might be...  
**[1:25:15-1:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:15):**  There's probably gonna be a lot of US, because I haven't left the country for two and a half  
**[1:25:21-1:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:21):**  years.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:22):**  But just what is working well in these contexts and how can I apply that to my particular  
**[1:25:27-1:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:27):**  situation?  
**[1:25:28-1:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:28):**  Yeah.  
**[1:25:29-1:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:29):**  So hopefully a whole lot of food for inspiration.  
**[1:25:32-1:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:32):**  Super exciting.  
**[1:25:33-1:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:33):**  Please keep in touch as that moves forward.  
**[1:25:35-1:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:35):**  I would love to see how this progresses.  
**[1:25:37-1:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:37):**  Yeah, me too.  
**[1:25:38-1:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:38):**  It's probably a few years down the track, but yeah, all good things to take some time.  
**[1:25:43-1:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:25:43):**  Something to look forward to for sure.

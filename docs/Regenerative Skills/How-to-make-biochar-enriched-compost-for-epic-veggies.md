**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:00):**  Biochar is really just the tip of the iceberg, one could say.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:08):**  We have a situation on our beautiful green-blue planet that we're losing 10 million hectares  
**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:13):**  of fertile soil per year.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:16):**  I've heard that being compared to 2,000 football fields every hour or something like that.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:24):**  Another drastic figure being communicated through the United Nations is that we have  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:31):**  60 harvests left.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:33):**  So five years ago we were talking, oh, this climate change thing, that's going to be a  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:38):**  problem in 100 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:39):**  Well, in the past five years it's become a problem in the next five years.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:44):**  And the time to act is now.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:48):**  It's also easily understood that people that might not have been dealing with these questions  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:00:55):**  during these past five, 10 years might find it a bit overwhelming, understandably so,  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:01:01):**  and shafoos just to shut off everything, go into denial.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:01:06):**  And we really have to face these things.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:01:09):**  What we want to do with Circle Carbon Labs is to show that not only are there solutions,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:01:17):**  they are very tasty, they are very beautiful, and they create all the conditions we need  
**[0:01:24-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:01:24):**  to have a healthy, thriving, abundant, and delicious relationship with nature.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:01:32):**  That's our message.

**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:02:40):**  A lot of what I spend my time on these days, between working with ecosystem restoration  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:02:45):**  camps, climate farmers, and of course running this show, is researching techniques and solutions  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:02:50):**  for people who are working to regenerate damaged landscapes, either for generally healthier  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:02:55):**  environments like native landscapes, or for rich and abundant farmland.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:02:59):**  Now since a lot of both of these goals revolve around the health of the soil as a foundation  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:04):**  for mycorrhizal and plant life, I continually come back to the power and potential of pyrolyzed  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:11):**  carbon, more commonly known as biochar.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:14):**  There are tons of examples of people making this remarkably simple product all around  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:18):**  the world and using it to restore health to poor and degraded soils.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:23):**  But since I've been here in northeastern Spain for a while now, I wanted to hear from someone  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:27):**  nearby who's worked with biochar into a profitable and ecological business.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:33):**  Meet Kristor Soderberg, the gentleman behind the Circle Carbon Labs on the island of Majorca.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:39):**  My corporate life ended in Brazil, where I was expat CEO of a Swedish industrial multinational,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:48):**  and got to see a lot of the biggest industries in the world.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:53):**  Basically see this extractivism going on and realize that this just doesn't work.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:03:59):**  So I chose not to be part of the problem.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:02):**  I didn't think I could be part of the solution, but of course I became very interested in  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:06):**  that.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:07):**  And after a period of self exploration, I started some different projects of carbon  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:15):**  capture and planting trees on an organic coffee farm in Brazil and doing different things.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:22):**  I came across biochar in that process of planting trees in Brazil, and then had the fortune  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:29):**  of meeting Albert Bates here on Majorca actually.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:33):**  And he gave me a book of his that he had just come out with called the biochar solution.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:38):**  And a lot of things clicked.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:40):**  This was 2011.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:43):**  And yeah, so I started, I became very interested in biochar and started doing little projects,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:50):**  one thing and the other.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:04:52):**  When I moved back to Majorca in 2013, I started doing workshops with local community, local  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:00):**  town halls, sustainability centers.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:05):**  And it wasn't until 2017 when I presented a project based on biochar at the university  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:11):**  and won a prize that I thought, okay, well, it's time to get serious.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:16):**  People really seem to get this and understand the validity of it.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:21):**  So I found some seed capital, seed funding through a partner.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:26):**  And we started developing, we started looking for land, found this property three years  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:32):**  ago, roughly, just under three years ago, and started doing our thing, started making  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:39):**  biochar, started making compost, started planting things with it.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:43):**  And now we have this, well, what people call the Findhorn Foundation of Majorca or Garden  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:50):**  of Eden.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:51):**  And we're getting all sorts of wonderful superlatives to describe our project.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:05:58):**  Before we jump into how to make biochar and how to use it, it's important to understand  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:02):**  a bit about the context that Chrystler and his team is working in.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:06):**  Majorca is the largest island in a chain called the Balearic Islands off the eastern coast  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:11):**  of Spain in the western Mediterranean.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:13):**  Like the rest of the Mediterranean area, it has a very rich agricultural history and long,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:18):**  long history of human habitation, as well as unique modern challenges.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:23):**  Well, we have a historical millinery oil, olive oil industry.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:31):**  Majorca was also known for its almond trees.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:34):**  I remember 30 years ago when I, or 40 years ago when I first came here, it was called,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:40):**  you know, the landscape was literally white from the almond blossoms.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:46):**  So there were 8 million almond trees on the island.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:49):**  I remember the number.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:51):**  But now, like so many other things, it's been attacked by the Shilela fastidiosa bacteria.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:06:57):**  And that's just a sign for me of depleted soils, nothing else.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:00):**  But we do have a very high degree of awareness on the island, partially because we have 25%  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:09):**  foreign population and foreigners come here because of the nature.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:13):**  And they also have the funds, the money to invest in very beautiful properties, plants,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:19):**  and there's usually a high degree of awareness around environmental issues.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:24):**  So we have about a thousand certified organic farmers on the island.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:32):**  And if I remember correctly, I think that means about 35,000 hectares are organically  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:39):**  certified on the island, and that accounts for about 12% of the island farming surface,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:46):**  which is a pretty high number.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:48):**  So that's a very good thing that there is so much awareness and people, you know, are  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:54):**  into organic farming.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:07:56):**  At the same time, of course, when you have 16 million tourists landing on the island,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:02):**  that puts tremendous strain on the water system, the waste management system, energy generation,  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:10):**  things like that.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:12):**  So that's something like so many other places we have to face, but perhaps, you know, stronger  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:21):**  because we're a closed system, we're an island.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:24):**  So it's very, it's very, it's very visible and you feel it when you, when you run out  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:30):**  of water, you run out of water.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:32):**  And right now the main electricity is being generated off a coal plant on the north side  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:38):**  of the island.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:39):**  And that coal, from what I understand, is being brought here from Australia.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:42):**  So not very sustainable.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:44):**  Yeah, you do better than that given the solar potential of that area.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:49):**  Well, but the present government is working on that.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:51):**  And Spain has taken a strong path towards solar.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:08:59):**  In response to those unique challenges, Circle Carbon Labs has developed multiple enterprises  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:03):**  that leverage the waste streams from the towns and the agriculture of the area to help provide  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:08):**  some of the needs of that same population and respond to the issues of degraded soil.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:13):**  They take in biomass in the form of organic waste and farm waste and turn it either into  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:18):**  microbially rich compost or biochar.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:21):**  The compost is then used to inoculate the biochar as they're mixed together creating  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:25):**  incredibly fertile soil that they then put on their market garden beds to grow nutrient-dense  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:30):**  produce for their community.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:31):**  But I'll let Kristor explain it in detail.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:34):**  So what we do is basically we take garden waste or agricultural waste cuttings, we turn  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:40):**  part of it into biochar, take the other part, turn it into compost, take any other organic  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:46):**  residues we can get our holds on, get our hands on to mix that with the compost, get  
**[0:09:51-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:09:51):**  an extremely rich, nutrient-rich fertile soil, we apply that in our greenhouses and people  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:00):**  come and see for themselves what we grow.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:05):**  And we sell our vegetables and they taste it and they come back for more.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:09):**  Well the, you know, tree cuttings, garden waste, organic waste makes up, you know, the  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:16):**  household organic waste usually makes up about 40% of our total waste stream.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:23):**  So it's seen as a waste, therefore as a cost.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:28):**  We get these garden cuttings and agricultural biomass waste for free.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:36):**  It doesn't cost us anything because we're providing a social service basically.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:41):**  The alternative is that it goes into a landfill or that it gets burned on the field, which  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:46):**  is really not doing anybody any good, not the soil, not the atmosphere, the environment  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:51):**  and not ourselves.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:54):**  It's less work.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:10:56):**  But you're missing out on the opportunity of regenerating soil.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:00):**  So our raw material doesn't cost us anything.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:05):**  In some cases we even charge for it.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:07):**  In the case of palm fronds, for example, which have a very strong heavy fibre and it's difficult  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:13):**  to decompose so we were able to charge a fee for that.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:18):**  Yeah, the overhead is the machinery and labour.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:22):**  In Europe our labour is high, the costs are high for obvious reasons.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:29):**  This can be done of course in any country and we feel strongly also about giving living  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:36):**  wages, dignified wages.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:39):**  So we will pay our team members a good wage.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:45):**  And we believe in the mid to long term that we will get there.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:51):**  Right now we're on a reduced schedule because of the corona.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:11:57):**  But we have had some very good months selling soil and vegetables.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:03):**  If it weren't for a storm we'd have a lot more vegetables.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:05):**  We had a storm, broke through 1434 glass panes of our greenhouse, wiped out our whole crop  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:13):**  so we lost basically three months income.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:16):**  Oh and a setback.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:19):**  But these are the setbacks we're going to have to get used to having.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:22):**  This is just going to be part of our reality.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:25):**  And you know like any farmer will tell you, well you lose a crop you just get up and plant  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:31):**  again.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:33):**  Despite these setbacks, or actually because of them, Circle Carbon Labs has found just  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:38):**  how valuable their service is to the people of their community, especially because of  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:42):**  the very dire circumstances that they recently went through.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:46):**  The green lining of the corona was that our soil projects ground to a halt.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:12:56):**  But we did have a lot of vegetables growing in our demonstration gardens.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:01):**  So we started to offer them and sell them.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:06):**  We delivered because we were in lockdown and people needed food.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:10):**  And we had just had this storm, Gloria, that basically emptied supermarket shelves after  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:14):**  three days because no fairies were coming from the mainland.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:18):**  And so we really felt a responsibility, okay well whatever food we have we have to make  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:22):**  it available.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:23):**  And so we started delivering vegetable boxes and people were very excited about our vegetables.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:31):**  And I'm not a farmer, I've never been in the produce business, I didn't have anything to  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:34):**  compare with.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:36):**  I've since seen a little bit what else is out there and I realize why people get so  
**[0:13:41-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:41):**  excited because there is a big difference when you grow vegetables in fertile soil.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:49):**  Sounds very matter-of-factly, down-to-earth, common sense, but you have not tasted a cucumber  
**[0:13:57-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:13:57):**  until you've tasted a cucumber that has grown in biochar enriched compost soil.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:05):**  So we sell soil, we're now up to a very healthy production level of about 20 to 30 cubic meters  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:13):**  per month.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:15):**  We sell that.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:16):**  But of course realizing this other business leg to stand on, we started using our own  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:22):**  soil to grow more vegetables.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:24):**  So now we have, what do we have, we've got, well we'll have within short order we'll have  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:30):**  around 3,000 square meters of soil being grown.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:34):**  That will contain roughly five tons of biochar.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:38):**  In other words, we will be sequestering roughly 20 tons of CO2 in our vegetable produce section.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:48):**  In addition to reducing nitrous oxide emissions by up to 40%, which happens when you apply  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:54):**  biochar to the soil.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:14:57):**  So it's an all-around good business idea.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:00):**  We have survived the corona, this second lockdown, which they call the state of alarm, but it's  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:07):**  basically the same thing because everything is just ground to a halt again.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:11):**  Yeah, I'm in it too, it's tough.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:15):**  But like I say, it seems like people have a lot of time on their hands and they really  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:20):**  want to find out about this.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:21):**  So it's very positive, it's very inspiring, and of course it's great to meet people that  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:27):**  are genuinely interested in these things.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:29):**  Alright, so let's really get into the secret sauce of this rich compost and biochar mix  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:34):**  that seems to be doing magic for their vegetables.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:37):**  As I mentioned in the beginning, biochar is pyrolyzed carbon, which sounds fancy, but  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:42):**  it really just means any kind of carbon-based material, which we often call biomass, like  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:47):**  straw, wood, leaves, veggie scraps or whatever, that's been burned completely in an oxygen-deprived  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:53):**  environment, and that's important.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:15:56):**  This has to happen at high temperatures as well to create the fractal molecular structure  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:00):**  of biochar which turns it into a crispy sponge essentially.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:05):**  When it's burned without oxygen, all the other elements are released as gas, and what you're  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:09):**  left with is an extremely porous piece of carbon that has amazing absorptive capacity.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:15):**  The biochar itself isn't what makes the soil rich, but rather all the micronutrients, microorganisms,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:21):**  and moisture that absorbs and holds stably for a long time before it breaks down.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:27):**  Up to 3,000 years, in fact.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:30):**  The other advantage is that unlike other super-absorbative materials, it freely releases its stored nutrients,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:36):**  microbial life, and moisture to plant roots, helping them grow and even get through drought.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:42):**  There are a lot of ways to make biochar, but I'll let Kristor explain his process.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:47):**  Well, for financial, for economical reasons, feasibility, financial feasibility, we have  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:54):**  the technology that gives you the biggest bang for the buck.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:16:59):**  So we use the Kon-Tiki.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:03):**  There's a lot of opinions about it.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:05):**  It really makes a lot of biochar at a low cost.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:08):**  That's what we're after.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:09):**  We would love to have technology that allows us to take advantage of the heat generated,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:17):**  generating electricity, for example, taking out wood vinegar, phosphorus, things like  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:21):**  that.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:22):**  But that's an investment that comes with a, well, minimum 500 to a million euros, 500,000  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:29):**  to a million euros.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:30):**  And we're not there yet.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:31):**  I don't even know if we have the biomass.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:34):**  I don't know if we have the feedstock that would be viable for that higher technology  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:39):**  because you need to have a very homogenous standard sized.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:42):**  So you need to treat the biomass first.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:45):**  So we use the Kon-Tikis.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:46):**  We have two of them.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:48):**  So on a good day, we can make two cubic meters in about four hours.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:17:54):**  Two cubic meters of biochar is roughly 500 kilos times 3.67.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:00):**  You come up roughly to four times that amount of CO2.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:06):**  So we can do roughly two tons of CO2 a day in four hours.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:14):**  And we mix that with our compost, roughly 10 to 20% of the finished product by volume.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:22):**  And we're just getting tremendous results.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:24):**  Again, I'm not a farmer.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:25):**  I'm not an agronomist.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:26):**  I'm not a biologist.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:29):**  My major was marketing and distribution.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:31):**  That's what I've done most of my life in consumer electronic and industrial products.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:37):**  So I've never had to sell refrigerators to Eskimos.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:44):**  So I find products that are good, that work, and that basically sell themselves.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:51):**  And by creating the conditions for that narrative to be told, we're able to get people interested  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:18:58):**  and get our soil and our vegetables out the door.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:02):**  Though the basics of this process are indeed really simple, there are a lot of nuances  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:06):**  that can make a compost and biochar mixture more effective, but that require a good understanding  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:12):**  of the crops that you'll be using it with and the needs of those specific plants.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:17):**  It takes a while to inoculate raw biochar effectively, but it can do wonders for your  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:21):**  compost pile if you add it in at the beginning.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:24):**  It can even increase microbial activity and speed up the process of decomposition up to  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:29):**  20%.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:31):**  It does need to sit in the compost at least two weeks to be completely inoculated though  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:35):**  because it takes a while for all of that goodness to absorb into the tiny micropores of the  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:39):**  carbon.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:40):**  For that same reason, it's not a good idea to put raw biochar directly into the soil  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:45):**  where you're planting because that same absorption effect can rob your plant roots of nutrients  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:50):**  initially.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:51):**  I guess part of the problem with biochar is that there are so many variables at work.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:19:56):**  You have the variable of what the feedstock is, you have the variable of what technology  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:01):**  is available from a financial point of view, you have the variable of what soil is where  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:07):**  you're at, so what does your soil need, and then you have the variable of what are you  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:12):**  going to plant in that soil.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:13):**  Is it for trees, fruits, vegetables?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:17):**  There's so many different applications.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:19):**  So you're working with all these variables and you have to get the ratios right.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:26):**  I think that's the challenge and that's what makes it both interesting but also more difficult  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:32):**  to grasp.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:34):**  Even though I have to say you can't do much wrong, you know, you can't go wrong by making  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:38):**  biochar and putting it into your soil.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:41):**  The effects, the benefits might vary, you know, because you can make better biochar  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:47):**  or worse biochar but you'll never hurt the soil.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:50):**  So I think that's really important to say you can never go wrong because by making biochar  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:55):**  you're capturing carbon and you're putting it into the ground, you're storing it, so  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:20:59):**  you've already done an incredible service to humanity and the planet.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:04):**  Number one, what happens when you put it into compost, just like you very well said, compost  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:10):**  by itself is great but when you add biochar to it, it's like putting that compost on turbo.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:16):**  You accelerate the decomposition and you accelerate the multiplier effect of the microorganisms.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:25):**  So you get more microbial activity, more decomposition, more ability of that soil to make nutrients  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:33):**  in the soil available to the plants.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:37):**  So it's basically a turbo.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:40):**  The other thing that I like to mention in combination with this is because we get a  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:45):**  lot of people saying, yeah, but how many, how often do you have to apply this soil?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:49):**  And I say, well, you know, that's where we have to change our thinking.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:21:53):**  We have to change the chip because we're so, we have this ingrained thinking that we have  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:01):**  to add like a fertilizer or some kind of additive to the soil to make things grow.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:07):**  No, we don't have to add anything.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:09):**  Nature takes care of that if it's in balance.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:13):**  So when we add biochar and we make those microorganisms thrive, then we're returning life to the soil.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:21):**  We're inoculating the soil.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:23):**  And if we keep feeding that soil with organic matter, we never have to add ever anything  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:29):**  to it.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:30):**  We just have to make sure that when we harvest our carrots or our cauliflowers or our red  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:34):**  beets or whatever you're growing, even the trees, that all the organic waste goes back  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:40):**  into the soil because that's feeding the organisms.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:44):**  And of course you want to keep it always covered.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:46):**  So if you don't have grass or things growing on it, you cover it with mulch because you  
**[0:22:50-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:50):**  want to, you're giving the soil back its natural balance of life and it's life that  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:58):**  creates life.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:22:59):**  The potential of biochar to improve soil is of course the main motivation to use it.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:04):**  It can boost the water holding capacity of soil enormously, helping arid regions to make  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:09):**  better use of the little rain that they receive, and even humid regions to overcome droughts.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:15):**  It can help sandy depleted soils to hold on to nutrients, it can help heavy clay soils  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:19):**  to avoid compaction and increase percolation, and it can sequester tons of carbon from the  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:24):**  atmosphere in the process.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:26):**  Biochar is also known as activated charcoal and is commonly used to filter water.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:31):**  It's even taken as a digestive supplement.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:33):**  I myself used to take capsules of it to get over bouts of parasitic infections during  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:37):**  my travels.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:38):**  It's a truly remarkable material that we should be directing more and more of our organic  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:43):**  waste to produce instead of burning it in the fields or burying it in landfills.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:47):**  See the thing is, when I started on this, I was just repeating the word biochar so many  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:55):**  times that people got sick of me and they just didn't want to even hear the word biochar  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:23:59):**  anymore.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:00):**  Now where they see the results, they say, well tell us about biochar, what's the deal  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:04):**  with biochar?  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:05):**  And now I'm saying, look, it's not really about biochar.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:07):**  The real stars here are the microorganisms.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:12):**  We're working with microorganisms.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:14):**  That's what we want to do.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:15):**  We want to make those microorganisms as happy, as cozy, as comfortable as we possibly can.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:24):**  And biochar through the molecular structure of all those cavities and that surface area  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:29):**  and those pores create just that.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:32):**  It makes it the ideal habitat for the microorganisms for them to put away a store of minerals and  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:39):**  nutrients and keep the humidity.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:42):**  And so, you know, you start, you sort of jumpstart the soil and if you keep it going, you know,  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:49):**  it just goes on and on and on for millions of years.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:52):**  That's what happened to this planet.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:24:54):**  That's why we created a habitat that made it possible for us humans to live here.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:00):**  The bummer is that for the past 300 years, we've been taking that carbon out of the soil  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:05):**  and throwing it back into the atmosphere, like saying, no, no, we don't want to make  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:08):**  this place livable by humans and other species.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:11):**  We just want to live super comfortable with a ton of excess energy in a short period of  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:17):**  time, but degrading the basic foundation that life is based on in this little window of  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:23):**  time and like this very, very delicate comfort zone that has allowed us to thrive up until  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:29):**  now.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:31):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:32):**  But, you know, before we go down that route, of course, I want to say that I'm a big fan  
**[0:25:36-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:36):**  of microclimates and there's lots of research and science to show that you can create microclimates.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:47):**  You can increase rainfall locally.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:50):**  You can increase growth locally.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:25:56):**  And that's what we have to do, because obviously, if you look at the news and you see all these  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:01):**  reports of fires and glaciers and floods and droughts, then, you know, it's easy to get  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:08):**  a little disheartened, to put it lightly.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:11):**  But we can solve this on local level.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:14):**  And if enough people do local initiatives, then all of a sudden we have a global solution.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:19):**  Kristo really hit the nail on the head there.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:21):**  I recently attended a biochar workshop with a local company in my area of Spain called  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:26):**  Carbon Vibo that echoed that sentiment when one of the other students asked them why they  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:30):**  didn't invest in a giant kiln to create biochar on a massive scale.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:35):**  The instructor, Javier, replied by saying,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:38):**  What's the point of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere if all of the transport to  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:42):**  get the biomass from all of these different agricultural fields to the kiln creates more  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:47):**  pollution than we're able to sequester?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:49):**  And it's true, biochar production is the perfect example of a method that makes most sense  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:54):**  at a small and local scale.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:26:57):**  Every industry that creates carbon-based waste could easily be making better use of these  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:27:01):**  materials, either with biochar or some other form of cycling the biological energy back  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:27:06):**  into the ecological system that it depends on.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:27:09):**  I want to thank Kristo and his team for the great work that they're doing for their community  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:27:13):**  in Mallorca, and here's how you can get in touch with them to learn more.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:27:18):**  Well thank you.

**[0:27:38-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:27:38):**  that using biochar in agriculture provides, not only on a local level, but anywhere around  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-biochar-enriched-compost-for-epic-veggies/#t=0:27:45):**  the world.

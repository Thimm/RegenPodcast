**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:01:40):**  In this session, I had the pleasure of speaking to the founder of Elemental Ecosystems, Zach  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:01:45):**  Weiss.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:01:46):**  Now Zach earned the distinction of being the first person to earn the Holzer Practitioner  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:01:50):**  certification from revolutionary Austrian farmer, Sepp Holzer.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:01:55):**  Through a rigorous two-year apprenticeship working alongside Sepp in North America and  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:01:59):**  Europe.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:00):**  Zach created Elemental Ecosystems as a for-benefit social enterprise focused on solving society's  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:06):**  growing environmental problems by considering the elemental relationship between biology  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:11):**  and hydrology.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:13):**  In this interview, Zach and I start by talking about the difference between a healthy water  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:16):**  cycle and one that's been compromised.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:19):**  We unpack the reasons why humans have desertified nearly one-third of the Earth's land and  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:24):**  how we can begin to reverse and regenerate that process.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:28):**  Zach also touches on some of the steps that anyone can take, whether you live on a large  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:32):**  farm or a small city apartment, to positively impact the water cycles in your local area  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:38):**  and he also shares many resources that you can look into to learn more about watershed  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:42):**  regeneration.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:44):**  This interview represents just the tip of the iceberg around water system regeneration  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:47):**  and I would love to do a follow-up interview with Zach very soon.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:51):**  So to those of you listening to this, please write to me at info at abundantedge.com and  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:02:56):**  send in the topics and questions you'd like for us to explore in greater depth when I  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:00):**  get the chance to continue this series again.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:02):**  Now I'll turn things over to Zach.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:04):**  Hey Zachary, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:08):**  How are you doing man?  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:09):**  It's just after the holidays.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:12):**  I'm doing excellent.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:13):**  Thanks so much for having me on Oliver.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:14):**  I'm really excited to talk about all this stuff.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:16):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:17):**  Ever since Cassie, our mutual friend, put us in contact, I've been really excited to  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:21):**  talk to you about the work that you do.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:23):**  So what do you say we just jump right into the questions?  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:27):**  Yeah, that sounds excellent.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:29):**  All right.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:30):**  So could you start by telling our listeners a little bit about your personal background  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:35):**  and how you got started with your interest in especially waterway regeneration?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:39):**  And I also know that you studied for a little while with a hero in the permaculture world,  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:44):**  Sep Holzer.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:45):**  So if you give us a little kind of lineage of how that happened.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:49):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:51):**  Yeah, I've been working with Sep for six years now, almost going on seven.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:03:56):**  And you know, my story is I really was someone who always looked first to nature for answers.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:03):**  And I remember thinking even at an early age that nature really was truth.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:08):**  So I went down a meandering path, was interested in behavioral ecology and ecology and ecosystems.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:15):**  And eventually came across a greenhouse where they had this platform of perpetual soils.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:23):**  And that gave me this soils background.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:26):**  And then in 2012, I got to go to a workshop that was a large project with Sep Holzer 60  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:34):**  people attended for a large project in Montana.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:38):**  And basically, I just worked my tail off the whole project sun up to sun down.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:43):**  I always tell people if you want to impress a farmer, just work harder than everyone else.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:49):**  And so I did that and proceeded to do that for a series of years.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:04:55):**  And now we have this great relationship where and you know, he has just totally opened my  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:00):**  eyes to everything that I dreamed about doing as a kid.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:06):**  I didn't really have anyone to teach me the how or the nuts and bolts basics.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:12):**  And he really provided that in more ways than I could have imagined.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:17):**  So I have this huge amount of gratitude for him as well.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:19):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:20):**  Can you tell me a little bit about the work that you did with him and some of the revelations  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:25):**  or learning experiences that really helped to propel you to where you are now?  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:30):**  Yeah, and I'd say every project still that I do with Sep, I learn a great deal because  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:35):**  there's so much involved.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:37):**  The easiest part of this is actually the ecosystem side.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:41):**  And so this is a process of really unwinding the mind and learning how to read ecosystems,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:47):**  read living beings.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:49):**  They're all speaking.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:50):**  They're not speaking English, but they're communicating all the time with everything  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:54):**  in the web of life.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:05:55):**  And so how do you start to read that and then start to creatively plan and interact with  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:01):**  that force?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:03):**  But then there's also a huge amount of work that needs to be done on the government policy  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:08):**  side, convincing people that this work should be done.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:12):**  And I'd say Sep has taught me just as much about interacting with the human world as  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:16):**  the natural world.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:18):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:19):**  Yeah, I mean, that's often where a lot of this gets caught up is when it comes to policy  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:24):**  implementation and getting governing bodies to, you know, sometimes it's not even as far  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:30):**  as support, but just not get in the way or to stop progress.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:35):**  Oh, exactly.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:36):**  This project in Montana, my first project with Sep is a great example of that.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:41):**  It was on a reservation.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:43):**  And so we were able to get permission to work with the water from the tribes, from the tribal  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:49):**  council that controls the water in the reservation.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:52):**  If that project was in the United States, not on reservation land, everything that we  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:06:58):**  did would have been entirely illegal.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:00):**  She would have been facing millions of dollars in fines.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:03):**  And this is the work that we did so that people understand was restore a wetland that had  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:09):**  an airstrip built in the middle of it.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:11):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:12):**  And we restored it into this place where now there's turtles breeding, there's waterfowl.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:15):**  You can see tracks from every type of wildlife in Montana.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:20):**  And this is illegal.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:21):**  This would be fined heavily and she'd have to turn it back to the way it was because  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:26):**  of the way the human management systems are right now.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:29):**  That's incredible.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:30):**  All right, so here, let's take a step back to get everyone oriented to the ideas that  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:35):**  you're promoting here.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:36):**  Can you talk a little bit about what a healthy water cycle looks like in nature and how it  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:42):**  can become compromised with the sort of downstream effects of desertification?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:46):**  Yeah, so a healthy water cycle, nature works in symbiosis in relation with all of the different  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:55):**  elements playing a role within a dynamic system.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:07:59):**  And so a healthy water cycle, for example, the trees are, for one, they're respiring  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:04):**  water which cools the air, which draws in more cool air being low pressure air that's  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:11):**  carrying humidity.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:13):**  And then the trees are actually respiring or they're breeding hygroscopic bacteria in  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:20):**  the stomatal cavities, releasing those into the atmosphere and actually seeding the water  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:24):**  vapor into clouds and then rain.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:27):**  And so on a continental scale, the forests are actually pulling moisture from the ocean  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:33):**  inland.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:35):**  That water's entering the cool shaded ground and then it's feeding the different reservoirs,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:40):**  rivers, creeks.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:43):**  You get this consistent balanced climate and consistent steady water availability.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:51):**  And so then looking into how that can be compromised, when you have bare open land on the hot soil,  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:57):**  the water can't infiltrate.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:08:58):**  And so when the rain events do happen, all of that rain runs downhill causing flooding  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:03):**  but then followed by drought because it's not infiltrating the way it used to within  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:08):**  a forest landscape.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:09):**  So now springs are going dry, creeks are getting low and hot, the aquatic life is all stressed,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:17):**  and you have all of these heat bodies rising off of the bare exposed earth like in a city,  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:23):**  for example.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:24):**  And so that high pressure air is actually preventing the low pressure humidity from  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:30):**  even entering into the continents.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:32):**  So you look at a place like Australia, it used to have a giant freshwater lake in its  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:37):**  center in this monsoonal rainy season and was a lush green continent like South America  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:44):**  is.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:46):**  But through basically human alteration of the landscape, it is what it is today, where  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:52):**  you have this high pressure rising heat body that prevents any of the moisture coming off  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:09:58):**  of the ocean from entering into the continent.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:00):**  Yeah, that's super daunting, especially because it's taken over such massive tracts of land  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:05):**  that the idea of altering those positively seems like a very insurmountable task, especially  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:12):**  to do anything on the scale that we're talking about that can actually have an effect on  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:18):**  the microclimate of a space.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:20):**  So let's talk about some of the practical ways, especially through your own examples  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:25):**  and work, of how we can start to regenerate waterways and reverse desertification on a  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:30):**  really large scale.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:32):**  Yeah, so the first step is to really store the seasonal rains.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:38):**  Even in a desert, when it rains, it floods, and all of that water is moving to select  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:43):**  points within the earth.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:44):**  And so how do you create water retention landscapes with the earthen materials using the clay  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:50):**  and the water-type materials in the earth to strategically hold that water so that you're  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:10:55):**  collecting and holding it through the dry times, which then gives you the water to re-establish  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:01):**  forest systems.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:02):**  Now as the forest shade is recovered, the soil actually absorbs the falling rain when  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:08):**  it enters, and you very quickly get a whole different type of cycle.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:13):**  And you spoke about there's these daunting areas, but we really have to work with the  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:18):**  leading edges because it creates a downwind effect.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:22):**  So for example, one of the really great projects, Willy Smith's work in Borneo, where they've  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:27):**  measured a 10% increase in rainfall from their work, but that increase is not just for them,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:33):**  but also for the areas downwind of them, because the trees are seeding that moisture.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:39):**  And so once you get the pump starting to work, it very quickly feeds itself, and this is  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:45):**  how you get these massive transformations in landscapes.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:49):**  Another good example would be in Portugal, a project that Sep did where I've visited,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:55):**  and it's incredible.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:11:56):**  They really created a water-sustainable community.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:00):**  Are you talking about the Tamara Village there?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:02):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:03):**  Oh, I followed that one closely.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:05):**  It's been so inspiring to see how that's changed.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:07):**  The lake that was put in there, actually that's something I want to talk about a little bit  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:10):**  later, but go ahead.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:11):**  Yeah, well, exactly.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:12):**  And it's a community that didn't have enough water, and now they have a surplus of water.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:18):**  And it's not the climate that's the problem, it's the human management, because we always  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:23):**  are getting rain at some point.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:25):**  Even in the most barren deserts on Earth, they get rain.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:30):**  It's about how do we store that water, and how do we really rehydrate it into the Earth.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:35):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:37):**  So, using that project as an example, what were the main steps that you did to manage  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:44):**  the landscape differently that led from a severe deficiency in water to a surplus in  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:51):** ... It's only a handful of years as well, right?  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:12:54):**  Yeah, it took three years for the lake to fill up.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:00):**  You can make these major interventions, which is a water retention feature.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:05):**  And it's important that this isn't a liner, this isn't a concrete dam, this is about creating  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:10):**  decentralized water retention where you're finding the natural clay layer within the  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:15):**  soil, and then using that clay to build up a wall to hold the water within that clay  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:22):**  layer.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:23):**  Because the very important part that's happening here is water cycle recharge.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:27):**  So from that project in Tamara, they actually have springs that have come back alive from  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:34):**  that lake feature, because the lake isn't holding the water like a bottle, it's actually  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:39):**  distributing it back into the Earth.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:42):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:43):**  So, let's go a little bit more into detail about how you can create those water retention  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:48):**  landscapes.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:49):**  I've heard of tons of different individual techniques, everything from following contours  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:54):**  on key line, either digging swales or using a key line plow, all the way to actually creating  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:13:59):**  lakes, dams, and water retention points, especially in valleys.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:04):**  And you talked about doing it by finding that clay layer.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:07):**  Now I know that you brought in a lot of heavy machinery to do something on a large enough  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:12):**  scale.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:14):**  And a lot of the questions that I get from listeners and people who hire us as consultants  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:19):**  is how to make those larger water features without doing, like you said, bringing in  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:24):**  either cement to seal it off or pond liners.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:30):**  Because clay can be different in every different spot, and depending on its purity or its makeup,  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:36):**  might not work sufficiently to really hold water in for a long period of time.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:43):**  And you bring up a really good point, because a really important part of all of this is  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:48):**  that we first think about where we are within the landscape, and what that part of the landscape  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:54):**  really wants.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:14:55):**  And so there are plenty of areas that I visit where a pond or a large water retention feature  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:01):**  is not a viable option because they don't have the right materials.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:05):**  Now that means they're within a different part of the landscape and that they should  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:08):**  focus their energy in different directions, whether that's terracing and reestablishing  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:14):**  forestry systems, or just getting the soils back to a really vibrant, structured, and  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:19):**  healthy state.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:22):**  There's no one-size-fits-all solution.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:24):**  And so you're really looking at, for example, looking at just building a water retention  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:29):**  feature.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:30):**  You need to look at a number of different variables, one being the land shape.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:35):**  Can you move a small amount of earth relatively for a large gain in the watershed of that  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:40):**  landscape?  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:42):**  And then the second would be the consistency of that earth.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:46):**  Do you have a clay layer to tie into?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:48):**  If you don't, now you need to look at different solutions.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:52):**  If you do, do you have enough clay to build up your dam wall?  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:56):**  And then you also need to look at the catchment.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:15:58):**  So how much earth is feeding that point, that collection point, and is that really going  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:05):**  to deliver enough water to charge this water body that you're creating?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:10):**  And so even within a site, you might find that there's 10 different spots where a pond  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:16):**  is possible.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:18):**  But there's two that are much better return on investment.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:20):**  And so those are the ones you focus on.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:23):**  So how do you start by assessing a landscape for its water harvesting potential?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:28):**  Obviously, every site is different.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:30):**  So being able to observe the site and gather data is going to be your first step, am I  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:37):**  right?  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:39):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:40):**  For me, the way that I've trained and learned, I can't tell anybody anything about a landscape  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:44):**  without seeing it.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:45):**  You can show me all the maps in the world and all the pictures, and I can get a rough  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:50):**  idea of what's there, but without seeing it and smelling it.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:54):**  And there are so many senses that you get from a landscape.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:16:58):**  And you really have to tune into what that landscape is offering to you and see what's  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:04):**  possible.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:05):**  And if you learn how to read landscape, you can tell from the types of plants that are  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:09):**  growing, how deep the water table is.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:12):**  You can tell by the way the soil has been deposited, how much water is moving and how  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:18):**  quickly it's moving.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:20):**  And water does a very good job of sorting material.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:24):**  So as water is eroding, it's carrying with it force and energy.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:29):**  And as it starts to get calm, it starts depositing those particles, starting with the largest  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:35):**  and then to the smallest.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:36):**  So first it deposits the gravel, then the sand, then the silt, and then the clay.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:41):**  And so at the right points within the landscape, water has already sorted the material for  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:46):**  you, delivering the best material to the spots where most water actually gathers.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:53):**  And so it's important to really tune into the history of the landscape that you can  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:17:58):**  read even in a moment at looking at it.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:00):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:01):**  And that's something that we've had to do extensively on our own site here in Guatemala,  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:06):**  because we're only on a half an acre and we are in sort of a depository spot in the valley  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:11):**  where we live in the mountains.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:13):**  And then we have, of course, everything draining out to a large lake.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:16):**  And figuring out those, like you said, those layers that build up through erosion events  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:23):**  has been key to assessing what could potentially be done without fighting against the landscape  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:29):**  but working with its natural cycles.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:32):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:34):**  And that really summarizes up what we're always trying to do very well.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:39):**  And so you want to look at where the landscape is within the larger landscape.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:43):**  And then I also do, whenever possible, geological test slices.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:48):**  So these are test digs done two, three meters deep, sometimes shallower, sometimes deeper,  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:18:56):**  but where I can actually feel all the different material and I take it in my hand and I can  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:00):**  say, okay, this is about 60% clay.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:03):**  That means we can use it for X, Y, and Z, or this is all gravel, sand, and cobble.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:09):**  This isn't going to work for a pond at all.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:12):**  And so very quickly, the landscape provides all the information you need to know what's  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:16):**  best to do in that place.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:19):**  Yeah, I mean, those are just invaluable skills no matter what it is you're trying to do with  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:23):**  a landscape.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:24):**  But as we're talking about bringing water into a site and making the best use of it  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:31):**  within any space or period of land, those are really the life accelerators.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:37):**  And if you can get your water systems dialed in and, like you said, even producing a surplus,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:43):**  the effect in the surrounding area can be massive in quite a short amount of time.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:47):**  Do you have some examples or some case studies that you could share where that's been achieved?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:19:54):**  And I think if you just think about it for a moment, it becomes very clear.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:01):**  Water is life, and that's becoming a trendy thing to say, but 70% of all life is water.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:09):**  And so when you have more water on a site, more life happens as a result.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:14):**  And so once you've addressed the water of a landscape, 70% of the work is done.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:20):**  You're going to grow lush vegetation.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:22):**  Now your goal becomes to direct which kind of lush vegetation you want.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:28):**  And so it can create this huge transformation.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:32):**  For example, in India, there's this movement of peasant farmers that have built 11,800  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:41):**  little water retention features.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:42):**  These are just things that they're doing by hand, no machinery, but on a village scale,  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:47):**  so lots of people.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:48):**  And this movement of farmers has restored five rivers and 250,000 wells.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:20:55):**  They've raised the water table six meters in some areas.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:00):**  And these are just by small peasant interventions, but done on a wide scale.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:05):**  Because that's really the thing.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:06):**  It's not about this large centralized water management like is done in so many places  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:11):**  now, but it's about decentralized water retention.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:16):**  And once you put the water back into the earth, the life happens.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:20):**  And so you could look at the lowest plateau is another example, an area the size of some  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:24):**  countries that was totally transitioned in a relatively short amount of time.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:31):**  And these examples are all over, whether it's in Spain or Portugal, or even in the Americas,  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:38):**  it doesn't take long once you get the water in the landscape for the life to happen.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:43):**  I mean, it's so true.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:45):**  So now you were talking about these small scale interventions.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:49):**  Let's transition now to talking about some of the actionable steps to improving your  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:54):**  own water cycle at maybe different residential levels.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:21:57):**  So you live in the country or the suburbs or the city.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:01):**  What are some of the most effective sort of reasonable budget and realistic changes that  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:06):**  someone could make to the land that they have access to?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:09):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:11):**  And I think one of the first things to consider here is before we even talk about having a  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:17):**  positive impact, we need to look at our current impact.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:21):**  And so in all of these different scenarios, the first thing I would suggest is for people  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:25):**  to look into their own relationship with water, how they're managing water in whatever domain  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:32):**  they have control of.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:33):**  And so for example, someone in a more rural setting, they have roads, they have a home,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:39):**  maybe multiple buildings, and then they have whatever areas have been cleared for lawn  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:44):**  or pasture.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:45):**  All of these surfaces are creating a lot of runoff.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:49):**  And so before we can, just to get to neutral, we need to start holding water within the  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:22:54):**  landscape just to offset the roads and our homes, we should have some water retention,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:00):**  whether this is a small pond or a little wetland area, or even just an area where you're deliberately  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:06):**  just spreading the water out so that it can soak into the landscape.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:12):**  And so there's a lot of opportunity, especially along roads.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:15):**  Anywhere where water is being channelized and concentrated, those are great areas to  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:20):**  create a small water retention feature.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:23):**  Even if the material is not so great and it doesn't turn into a year-round pond, you're  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:28):**  going to be helping to infiltrate the water that used to infiltrate on that landscape  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:33):**  before the structures that were built.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:34):**  Yeah, and if nothing else, reduce the amount of soil erosion runoff and catch that before  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:39):**  it leaves your site, right?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:42):**  Absolutely, absolutely.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:44):**  And if it's along a steep road or something, you're going to have gravel being deposited  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:48):**  there that you can use to repair your potholes.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:50):**  I mean, it's a very useful system.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:53):**  And so trapping the material and the water on whatever scale, now on a suburban sense,  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:23:59):**  this might just be your home.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:01):**  Maybe you have a rain garden off of your gutters so that all of the rain water from your roof  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:08):**  is soaking into your garden area.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:11):**  And it creates a garden that you don't have to water.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:13):**  And it, again, puts that water back into the earth instead of putting it down the road  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:19):**  in through the sewer systems and out into whatever body of water is nearby.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:25):**  And as far as vegetation to accomplish the same goals, I know we talked a lot about earthworks  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:30):**  and how to sort of structurally readjust a landscape.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:34):**  But root systems and vegetation can also make a huge impact in how much water that a soil  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:41):**  body can store, right?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:44):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:45):**  Not only how much it can store, but how the water infiltrates into the landscape.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:50):**  So tree root systems actually help move water down as well as up.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:24:55):**  So in the rain events, they're collecting water and it's running down along the roots.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:00):**  And so, and then the other thing is providing shade and protection for the soil allows more  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:06):**  soil life to exist and that lower temperature allows whatever water enters it to infiltrate  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:12):**  a lot better.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:13):**  If you imagine a sponge, when a sponge is dry and hot, the water can't even enter into  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:20):**  it.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:21):**  Once it's a little bit moist and cool, it just soaks it right up.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:24):**  And so one of the biggest things people can do is not so much even creating water features,  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:29):**  but just creating shaded earth places where there are trees, where there are a few trees  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:34):**  together that are helping drive that water deeper and protect the soil to create a healthy  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:40):**  living sponge.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:43):**  Now I've heard that can also be in a really effective way to retain water in a landscape  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:47):**  on very steep slopes where digging things like swales or other water features can actually  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:53):**  become dangerous because if they're in any way destabilized can cause sort of big erosive  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:25:58):**  events down below.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:02):**  In place of that you can start to plant like key line rows of trees that allow the soil  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:08):**  to infiltrate in without sort of collecting and becoming a potential hazard.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:13):**  Absolutely, and the best way to infiltrate water is to do it a little bit everywhere.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:20):**  And the easiest solutions are often times just to stick a tree in the ground instead  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:25):**  of doing these massive earthworks.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:28):**  And a lot of times it would just be as simple as stop mowing your lawn and eventually the  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:34):**  trees will actually come back.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:36):**  So we don't even have to do anything.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:39):**  You can do things to speed it up and all of this, but we have to stop doing the things  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:44):**  that are creating the broken water cycle first and foremost.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:47):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:48):**  I'm so glad that you mentioned that because it's something that I've really kind of in  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:53):**  assessing a lot of projects and working with clients have figured out that quite frankly  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:26:58):**  you don't need to make such a concerted effort at building or replacing or adding on to things.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:05):**  Often times you can save money and effort just by stopping the destructive practices  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:10):**  which are in many cases extremely consumptive.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:15):**  Especially things like lawn maintenance, right?  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:17):**  Oh, exactly.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:18):**  It's time consumptive, energy consumptive, financially consumptive, and there's no benefits.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:24):**  It's just this thing that we feel like we need to do and people need to start waking  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:29):**  up and realizing the greater impact that it's having.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:32):**  All right.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:33):**  So if you have access to almost no land, so you live in an apartment or a condo or some  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:39):**  area that's quite frankly out of your control, whether you're renting or whatnot, what are  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:45):**  some of the things that you can do to impact your own water use?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:50):**  I think there are two big things that I would suggest people in this scenario do.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:56):**  One is actually just composting.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:27:59):**  Taking their organic waste and composting it and turning it into a nice rich compost  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:07):**  that's full of good healthy life and then go and bring that compost to whatever patch  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:12):**  of green there is around.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:14):**  If there's a tree in the park, if there is an urban garden, whatever that is, that in  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:20):**  itself creating that filter again is actually going to help a lot.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:24):**  And the other piece that I would really love to see people in this scenario become more  
**[0:28:27-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:27):**  involved in is water policy, civil courage, civil action, becoming a voice for water.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:35):**  People in the cities have access to the various governments, the regulating bodies, the corporations,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:42):**  all of these different organizations that are creating really massive negative changes  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:47):**  to the water cycle.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:48):**  And so it's time for city dwellers to stand up and start being a voice for water where  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:54):**  water doesn't otherwise have a voice.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:56):**  I completely agree with that.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:28:59):**  Oftentimes affecting things on a systemic scale can be really daunting, especially as  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:05):**  people feel increasingly cut off from governmental bodies and policy makers.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:10):**  Can you give us some examples of where those types of shifts have happened?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:14):**  Because I'm of the opinion that simply protesting or showing dissent towards an existing policy  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:22):**  is not terribly effective unless you have an alternative or a solution that you can  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:27):**  actually advocate for.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:29):**  Well, exactly.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:31):**  And no is not enough.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:33):**  No is never going to create any positive change.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:37):**  And so it is very important to not just have these movements and occupations that are anti,  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:44):**  but they're actually pro something.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:46):**  And they very clearly say that so that that message can spread.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:49):**  And so for example, in New Zealand, a movement of indigenous people, the Māori, granted  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:29:58):**  a river personhood.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:00):**  And so what this did is it made it so that that river has the same rights that a person  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:05):**  does.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:06):**  And so people have to treat it with a degree of respect and it removed a lot of pollution  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:11):**  and it basically gives a framework with which to regulate.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:18):**  And then there's great movements like in Mexico.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:21):**  There's this community that lives along the river, Hākamoko, and they've always lived  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:27):**  along the river, the fishing community, tourism community, and the government has improved  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:33):**  this giant hydropower dam that will kill the river basically.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:37):**  And for five years going, the people have stopped the dam from being built because every  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:43):**  time the contractors come out, everyone in the town goes there with their machetes and  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:48):**  stays there until they leave and they have the area under 24 hour surveillance, all volunteer  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:54):**  run.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:30:56):**  And so there are ways that that can be successful.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:01):**  But I think what could be really successful is that we start going to the governments  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:05):**  of the world and basically creating a plan that's the restoration of the biosystems of  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:12):**  the earth as catastrophe mitigation.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:17):**  Everywhere there's problems with flood, problems with drought, problems with fire, and the  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:21):**  expenses of these are getting into the billions of dollars.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:26):**  And so it's actually becoming cheaper to regenerate the earth's biosystems than to keep rebuilding  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:32):**  after catastrophe.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:34):**  And so even if the government bodies don't care at all about the health of the planet,  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:38):**  just from a financial perspective, there's starting to be a very strong case for this  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:43):**  movement.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:44):**  And if you look at in the Americas, in North America, during the time of the Great Depression,  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:51):**  the government created a policy that was the civilian conservation corps that had all of  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:31:56):**  these people going out and terracing landscapes and planting trees and creating erosion mitigation.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:03):**  It employed something like 5 or 10% of the country at one point, and it stopped the dust  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:09):**  bowl.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:10):**  And so there are these good examples of positive movements where, because we do have to move  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:18):**  past just this no anti, that's not going to solve anything.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:23):**  We have to actually start presenting the solutions that we want to take the place of those things.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:28):**  Yeah, I profoundly agree with that.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:30):**  Now, I know you've also mentioned when you and I talked before this that you have a lot  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:35):**  of resources that you can point people to in order to learn about more of these topics  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:39):**  in depth, especially to find practical information on not only reading landscapes and diagnosing  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:45):**  what they're able to do with the land that they have some control over, but the different  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:50):**  ways that they can affect their own water consumption and interaction and work towards  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:32:57):**  regenerating waterways in general.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:01):**  And so these are going to be the different people around the world that I think are doing  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:07):**  really amazing work with the water cycle.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:09):**  And so Sep Holzer, my mentor, is a good place to start.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:13):**  Use books, Desert or Paradise, DVD, lots of videos online.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:18):**  If you just YouTube Sep Holzer, you'll find a wealth of information on this general approach.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:25):**  Another one would be the Flow Partnership.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:27):**  This is an organization working with Rahindra Singh, the movement in India that I mentioned  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:33):**  of these peasant farmers that have been restoring whole river systems, huge watersheds.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:39):**  And so the people are seeing really amazing impact there.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:43):**  Willy Smith's work in Borneo is another good example of how forests in the water cycle  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:49):**  are linked.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:50):**  And all of these people, there's different TED Talks you can find from them.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:54):**  And if you just search these names, you should be able to find a good bit.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:33:59):**  Peter Andrews in Australia is another one that in all of these people are doing the  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:03):**  same thing.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:04):**  They're doing decentralized water retention landscapes, creating interventions on the  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:08):**  landscape to hold water where water is being collected in the rainy seasons, in the rainy  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:14):**  times, and really getting incredible results.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:18):**  Yeah, let me just throw in Tom Duncan of Aqua Biofilter there as well.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:23):**  I'll put in a link to the podcast that I recorded with him from, I think it was two seasons  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:28):**  ago now.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:29):**  But his work for floating wetland systems, using plant roots to actually take out toxins  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:37):**  and put it into plant bodies has been really inspirational for me as well.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:42):**  All of those resources, I'll make sure to put in the show notes for this.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:46):**  Yeah, and another one along that line would be John Todd as well and his living systems,  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:53):**  where they just created basically ecological systems that filter in clean water.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:34:58):**  Yeah, there are increasingly inspiring examples all over the place of people really spearheading  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:35:04):**  these initiatives and getting real work done.

**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:35:47):**  I have talked a little bit about creating a series out of this topic.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-weiss/#t=0:35:52):**  And I would love to hear from listeners exactly what sort of format and what kind of questions

**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:14):**  Hey everybody and welcome to a really unique episode that I've got for you today.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:18):**  We actually got to speak to two experts in the field who happen to be good friends of  
**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:23):**  Neil Hegarty.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:24):**  So Neil, why don't you tell us who we get to speak to today and what they're all about?  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:28):**  Yeah, I had a great time today talking to my good friends Michelle Sultan and Juliana  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:35):**  Gobata.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:36):**  They're both passionate permaculture lists, but from different backgrounds.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:40):**  Juliana's a landscape architect and agroecologist and Michelle focuses kind of on project management,  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:47):**  economics and comes from a sociology background.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:50):**  They're both really passionate about development issues and ecology in Guatemala.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:01:56):**  So they got together and formed this really interesting company which distributes the  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:02):**  produce of organic producers to people in Guatemala City and Antigua.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:07):**  Nice.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:09):**  It's called La Botica Verde and tell me a little bit about what y'all got to talk about  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:14):**  in this interview.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:15):**  Yeah, well firstly, they talked about what La Botica Verde is, which actually kind of  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:20):**  means the green pharmacy would be like a close description because they're really passionate  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:25):**  about this idea that your food is your medicine and your medicine is your food.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:30):**  But we really covered a wide range of topics because the girls have such diverse and interesting  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:36):**  backgrounds that they really link what they're doing very much to the entire global movement  
**[0:02:42-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:42):**  and very much to the kind of issues, the global issues that affect Guatemala on a micro level.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:51):**  Yeah, you guys got to cover a very broad range of topics here and even touched on some of  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:02:57):**  the social political issues that make a business like this and the movement towards regenerative  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:02):**  agriculture somewhat of a hurdle here in this country.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:07):**  So why don't we just jump right into the interview and hear what they've got to say.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:11):**  Yeah, let's do it.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:12):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:13):**  Hey, Michelle and Julie, thanks so much for joining me today.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:16):**  Hi, Neil.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:17):**  How are you?  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:19):**  Really good.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:20):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:21):**  We're doing great.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:22):**  Yeah, we're really happy to be getting a chance to chat with you guys about all these things  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:27):**  that we both love so much.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:28):**  Yeah, I'm super excited.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:30):**  It's great to be interviewing my two of my best friends here in Guatemala and two women  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:36):**  that I have a huge amount of respect for.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:39):**  So look, I've got loads that I want to talk to you guys about.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:42):**  So how about we just get right into it?  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:44):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:45):**  All right.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:46):**  So why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourselves, what your backgrounds  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:52):**  are, sort of how you got into permaculture, agroecology, the ecological movement in general.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:03:59):**  Okay.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:00):**  Well, my name is Michelle and my background is in sociology, Latin American studies and  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:14):**  business.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:15):**  That's what I studied in school.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:17):**  But you could say that my passion for agriculture started about five years ago when I was working  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:23):**  in international development in Guatemala and I didn't understand how in a country that  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:27):**  has such fertile soils and over 50% of the population engaged in agriculture in some  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:33):**  way, how we could have at that time the worst chronic malnutrition index in the Western  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:39):**  hemisphere.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:41):**  And in my quest for trying to understand that paradox, I started learning more about agriculture  
**[0:04:50-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:04:50):**  and different ways of growing food just to try to understand like exactly how the system  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:02):**  is leading to these problems.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:06):**  And it was while I was doing that that I started, I put a seed on the ground.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:09):**  I had never grown anything in my life and from there came this love for agriculture  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:15):**  and later on in life I found out about permaculture as a really cool way to design systems that  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:22):**  are efficient and that could really help in this problem that we have with malnutrition.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:29):**  So it's a little bit about me.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:30):**  I'll pass it off to Julie now.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:32):**  All right.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:33):**  Thank you.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:35):**  My passion for agriculture really started at an early age because I grew up in a small  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:41):**  town and we were always outdoors and trees and being really close to nature.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:47):**  And then I had the great opportunity to study at UC Santa Cruz, which has an amazing program  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:52):**  for sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:54):**  And Steve Gleason is one of the professors there.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:05:57):**  And he was such a phenomenal mentor and really showed us how creatively we can solve so,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:03):**  so many things in terms of productivity and of using ecosystems and really the way he  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:12):**  explains it is agroecology.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:13):**  I absolutely love that word because it is designing ecosystems to produce agriculture,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:20):**  to produce things that we can actually benefit from in a very direct way, even though there  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:25):**  are many things that we benefit from in ecosystems without them being necessarily agriculturally  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:30):**  productive.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:32):**  And my satisfaction of working with agriculture really comes from this idea of being able  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:41):**  to help humanity be a constructive part of the world ecosystem.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:47):**  And since agriculture is one of the pillars of society and it's something that absolutely  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:53):**  determines whether a society is healthy or not, it was really easy for me to place myself  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:06:59):**  within all of that and my dream is creating this connection with humans and their food  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:04):**  source.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:05):**  And I started a business six years ago trying to do that idea and creating urban edible  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:13):**  landscapes to bring people closer to their food source.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:18):**  And I realized that that is working all right, but really where we need to focus on is what  
**[0:07:23-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:23):**  we're doing now with La Votica Verde in getting farmers access to bigger markets and incentivizing  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:32):**  their production process so that it's as sustainable as possible and really creative in finding  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:38):**  the solutions that we are seeing that there are problems too.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:45):**  Amazing.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:47):**  Great answers guys.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:48):**  Michelle, I love how honest you are about not coming from an agriculture background  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:53):**  at all.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:07:56):**  From knowing you personally, I'd really admire how brave you were in taking those first steps  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:02):**  and following your interest and your passion and kind of planting that seed as you say.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:07):**  And Julie, wow, your background is amazing.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:10):**  I know from having worked with you personally, all the kind of knowledge and passion you  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:15):**  have and it really comes through there.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:17):**  So what I want to get to know is what was the idea behind starting this business venture  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:24):**  that you're in now?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:26):**  Because obviously it wasn't just about making money.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:30):**  No, that definitely wasn't our main goal with starting the business.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:35):**  I mean, Julie and I became friends a couple of years ago and it really happened very organically.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:43):**  We were just talking about the state of the world and obviously I'm engaged with small  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:47):**  holders in a different way than Julie was, but we both were seeing a lot of the problems  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:54):**  that were created by conventional agricultural systems and their impacts on the environment  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:08:59):**  and the impact on people's health.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:02):**  And so just in discussing kind of the state of the world as it is today and all the problems  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:08):**  that we can see with the way that our food is currently produced, we saw also a big opportunity  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:14):**  to get involved by working together.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:18):**  So leveraging my skills in business and her skills in production and helping smallholders  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:26):**  get connected to local markets.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:28):**  And the way that we were doing or that we are actually doing that with La Botica Hérere  
**[0:09:34-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:34):**  is by using e-commerce and being able to deliver organic produce that's grown locally and connecting  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:43):**  smallholders to local markets.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:46):**  So that's a little bit of like an introduction of what the company does.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:51):**  What does the name mean for our non-Spanglish speakers?  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:09:56):**  By the way, Julie and Michelle are Guatemalan despite what their English might sound like.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:01):**  So yeah, can you explain what the name means?  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:03):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:04):**  La Botica Hérere, La Botica Hérere, it's three words.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:10):**  Botica is an old-timers kind of pharmacy and like a little shop, you know, so something  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:18):**  like an apothecary almost.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:20):**  And we're interested in people creating a relationship between understanding that food  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:26):**  means health and that through choosing items that are grown sustainably in a healthy way  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:33):**  and in a close cycle ecosystem that they're going to be receiving nourishment, a profound  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:39):**  sense of nourishment from their food sources.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:42):**  And we also wanted to help people connect to the idea of going back to the source, back  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:48):**  to how our grandparents used to be in relationship to their agriculture where they know their  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:53):**  farmers and they value their farmers and they were part of an integrated community.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:10:59):**  And that's what we're trying to create with La Botica Hérere, a really integrated system.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:05):**  This might also be a good time to add that the way that we describe our mission is that  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:09):**  we put health first, the health of our clients, the health of our producers and the health  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:13):**  of our planet.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:14):**  And that is really encompassed in the word botica because a pharmacy, typically people  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:22):**  think of a pharmacy as somewhere where you go to get healthy.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:26):**  And like Julie mentioned, we want people to make that relationship between health and  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:30):**  what you're eating.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:31):**  Wow, it really is such a beautiful concept.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:35):**  I love it, you know, La Botica Hérere.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:38):**  And it's just that simple idea of let your food be your medicine and your medicine be  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:43):**  your food, right?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:49):**  One of the things I love about your business is, and you mentioned it, it's this diverse  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:54):**  background and friendship, obviously.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:11:57):**  But you know, Michelle, you came from more of a sociology, project manager, economist,  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:05):**  and Julie, you were more of an expert in production and agroecology.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:11):**  Can you talk a little bit about the synergies between your, that are developing as your  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:17):**  business grows and maybe some of the challenges about working with somebody else, especially  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:21):**  a friend?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:22):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:23):**  Well, I think the most important thing to point out here is that the benefits that we  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:30):**  bring to the table far surpass any difficulties of having to ask another person for guidance  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:37):**  or having to ask another person for permission or for their input, you know?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:42):**  And I think my personality is very driven and I like to get things done quickly.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:51):**  And I've been working with myself for the last, I mean, I have a team, but I'm basically  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:12:57):**  the person who gets to call the shots, you know?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:01):**  And it's really nice for me to be like, okay, I have this idea and I'm going to execute  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:05):**  it and I'm going to execute it to the best of my capacities, which are these and these  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:08):**  and this.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:09):**  And then I just go ahead and get it done, you know?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:13):**  And I think that maybe that's in part because I work so closely with agriculture and like,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:18):**  if you put something in, you're going to get something out, you know?  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:21):**  And it's kind of that idea of seeing a progression.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:28):**  And whereas now that we're, well, we have a business together, right?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:33):**  So we both have to really pay attention to what the other person can give you and can  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:39):**  bring it to the table and all the assets that that person can also give.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:43):**  And so we actually had a conversation about this today in the morning and how Michelle  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:49):**  has this brilliant mind and this brilliant capacity for understanding how systems work  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:13:55):**  and for creating processes that we can follow to create excellence within our company, which  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:02):**  is something that I don't have or I'm learning now thanks to her and thanks to some accelerators  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:07):**  I've done before.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:09):**  And the fact that she has this analytical mind and that she can see, create a projection  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:17):**  for us in the big picture is something so valuable for the company.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:21):**  And our company would simply not work if we didn't have that.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:25):**  It would just, it would, you know, it would be a fireball.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:28):**  It would be burned bright and then die off because it needs that follow through that  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:34):**  an analytical mind with business acumen can give you.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:38):**  Well, Julie is also being very humble, right?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:41):**  About talking what I bring to the business, but really this business would not be able  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:46):**  to work without her because the connections that Julie has made with smallholders, the  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:53):**  follow up that she does in the field with them, all the technical assistance that she  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:57):**  provides.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:14:58):**  I mean, smallholders, the ones that we're working with right now, a lot of them are  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:02):**  currently growing organically, but they don't know about standards.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:06):**  They don't know about quality or consistency or volume, which are some of the things that  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:11):**  you need to get to market.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:13):**  And if she wasn't working so closely with them and all of our sourcing branch of the  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:18):**  company, we wouldn't have a product to sell.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:21):**  So she's definitely selling herself short there.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:23):**  Like this would not be possible without her.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:26):**  And I think like, yeah, it takes both of us.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:31):**  And I think something really beautiful is that a business partnership is a lot like  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:37):**  a love interest or a love partnership with someone else in that you have to be honest  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:41):**  with the person and you have to admire and respect the other person.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:46):**  And if those three things are there, then you really get like a beautiful relationship  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:51):**  and partnership out of it.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:55):**  Wow, that's so beautiful, Michelle.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:15:59):**  And yeah, I think what really comes through from both those answers is that this is a  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:04):**  symbiosis, right?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:05):**  You're both working together.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:07):**  You're far greater than the sum of your parts, which incidentally are, you're also forces  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:14):**  of nature on your own.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:15):**  So together, I'm really excited to see what you're going to get done.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:20):**  So Michelle, I want to go back to something that you mentioned briefly there, or actually  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:25):**  that Julie mentioned about you, which is your kind of your savviness, economically speaking.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:32):**  And I almost feel like there's this little bit of like a choque, you know, like a clash  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:39):**  between people who are business minded and maybe people who identify as permaculture  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:44):**  list.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:45):**  It's almost like money has this like bad name.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:49):**  And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the importance of economic sustainability  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:16:56):**  within ecologically minded projects, because I feel like there's a little bit of within  
**[0:17:01-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:01):**  the permaculture community, this idea that profit is bad or at least just this general  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:11):**  kind of discomfort with the business world where it's seen as like, you know, business  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:17):**  are the bad guys and the polluters and, you know, the permaculture lists live without  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:21):**  money and all the rest of it.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:22):**  So I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about that.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:25):**  Definitely.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:26):**  Well, for starters, I should say that we don't call ourselves just a business.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:32):**  Like we call ourselves a social business.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:35):**  And maybe that's like a very trendy word to use now, but we really live and breathe the  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:40):**  triple bottom line.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:41):**  And the triple bottom line means caring about more than profit maximization.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:45):**  You care about the environment, you care about society and you care about making it financially  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:51):**  sustainable.  
**[0:17:52-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:17:52):**  And having defined that, I will also say that I have a very sober view of money.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:01):**  Like I think that money is just what people like the way that we value things in our society.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:07):**  So I don't think money in itself is evil in any way, you know, and I don't think that  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:12):**  we should think of all business as something evil.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:16):**  I think that it can have a negative consequence if you do things solely for profit maximization  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:25):**  or if the product itself doesn't contribute in some way to our society, like in a positive  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:31):**  way, or if it doesn't contribute positively to our environment, then I definitely think  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:36):**  that it can be negative.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:38):**  But really a business, what it is at its essence is a way for you to create value in society.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:46):**  And money is just the way that people say, yes, I value what you are offering, you know.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:53):**  So I definitely don't think that the two are mutually exclusive.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:18:57):**  I definitely think that there is a lot of, like you said, symbiosis, I think that's a  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:03):**  great word.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:04):**  Because there's a lot of opportunity for marrying the two things because ultimately I want people  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:11):**  to value organic food.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:13):**  I want people to value the way that that food is grown, you know, and I want the people  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:18):**  who grow that food to have access to a better quality of life.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:22):**  And I don't think that there's anything negative in doing it in that way, you know, especially  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:27):**  if you're paying attention to all the externalities and the impact that it's having both in the  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:33):**  environment and on our society.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:39):**  Yeah, the word externalities is such an interesting one in economics.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:46):**  So many actually really important things get relegated to unimportant externalities, right?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:53):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:54):**  But the things that you really have an impact in the world, regardless of the industry or  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:19:59):**  the sector that you're working in, you have to measure your impact.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:05):**  You need to have metrics and you need to know, okay, like if our goal is to reduce waste  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:09):**  because we also have a zero waste commitment and we try to reduce all the trash that's  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:13):**  created throughout the value chain.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:15):**  So we work with our producers to not use plastic, not use styrofoam.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:18):**  We have a returnables program so that people can return the packaging, the little packaging  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:22):**  that we do use.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:23):**  We also, the packaging that we do use, which is again very little, a lot of it is biodegradable.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:30):**  You know, I think it's important to say, okay, if we have a zero waste commitment in our  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:34):**  company, how are we actually measuring whether or not we are having that positive impact  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:41):**  that we want to see in trash reduction?  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:43):**  So if you don't measure your activities, you don't actually know what those externalities  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:49):**  are.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:50):**  You're doing things thinking that they're having a positive impact, but it's not until  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:20:54):**  you measure that impact that you really know if you're having the impact that you want  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:02):**  to have, you know?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:03):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:04):**  It's so interesting.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:05):**  And also measuring the impact.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:07):**  The impact doesn't have to be negative, right?  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:09):**  We can also, as farmers, as designers, as people have a positive impact.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:16):**  But also that's important to measure in some extent.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:20):**  I know it's something you often push me to do, to measure the amount of topsoil that's  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:25):**  on my land this year with how much is going to be there next year or how much the groundwater  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:30):**  table is coming up every year.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:34):**  You know, and I never listen to you because I'm too lazy, but I actually do agree with  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:37):**  you.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:38):**  Well, it's hard.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:39):**  It's hard, you know?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:40):**  It's easier said than done.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:41):**  Totally, totally.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:42):**  I mean, for us it's hard.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:43):**  You know, we would have to measure how many tons of plastic are typically created for  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:50):**  someone who goes to the supermarket versus someone who gets one of our zero waste boxes.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:21:56):**  Yeah, it's so interesting.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:00):**  So I have another question.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:02):**  Michelle, I think it was you, but you both alluded to it, this idea that Guatemala is  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:09):**  this extraordinary country.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:11):**  It has gold in the hills and minerals and all kinds of natural resources, loads of water,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:21):**  amazing biodiversity, black volcanic soils.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:28):**  So if I don't know anything about this kind of stuff, I look at this place and I see some  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:33):**  of the rare examples of where the land is being treated well and I see paradise and  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:36):**  I say, well, why is this place not the most amazing place in the world?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:41):**  Why is it not the richest country in the world instead of being one of the poorest?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:45):**  Julie, I want you to maybe, given your lens as an agriecologist, could you just maybe  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:52):**  give your take on some of those somewhat baffling questions when you look at these things for  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:22:59):**  the first time?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:00):**  This is a subject that pertains to history, economics, globalization, and it far exceeds  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:11):**  the scope that I am capable of explaining.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:15):**  What I can tell you is that the people, there's many different sectors that are dealing in  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:23):**  agriculture in Guatemala.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:26):**  There's sectors that produce monoculture for export, there's small producers of subsistence  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:34):**  living, agriculture methods.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:37):**  There's been a lot of bad information that's been spread out and given through different  
**[0:23:44-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:44):**  stakeholders in all the previous political agendas that have run through the country.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:23:55):**  All these things, these really vast monopolies and these vast corporate systems are the reason  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:06):**  why, or a huge reason why we're where we are right now as a country.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:13):**  I think that there was a lot of valuable information in how the original indigenous people managed  
**[0:24:23-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:23):**  their lands in terms of even things that nowadays we think is something negative, which was  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:30):**  burning for example.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:32):**  But within the system that they managed, it actually did make sense and they never damaged  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:38):**  the soils.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:42):**  It actually took me studying that in California to understand why it didn't work back in the  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:50):**  day.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:51):**  But obviously their rotation systems were month-long rotation systems or year-long rotation  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:24:57):**  systems where they wouldn't come back to that site for five years.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:02):**  And when they burned, they actually left the top of the soil protected by a cushion of  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:11):**  moist organic matter from leaves and small branches.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:16):**  And so what they burned was really the thicker material that replenished the potassium in  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:21):**  their soils.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:22):**  And when we think about how there's amazing systems that were already in place and we  
**[0:25:29-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:29):**  look at the systems now, hillsides with absolute zero management for soil and water, there's  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:37):**  no conservation of forests.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:40):**  But it's not that the people don't want it.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:43):**  It's first of all that they've been brainwashed to thinking that that's their only alternative  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:49):**  or to think that they need, or at this point they really do need, those soils are so eroded  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:25:56):**  that they need to put fertilizer in because that's what they've been taught to do and  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:03):**  that's what they've been brainwashed to do instead of doing swales and building soil.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:08):**  And also a lot of the land isn't theirs anymore.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:13):**  There has been a huge loss of land to the indigenous community for tons of different  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:18):**  reasons, very political and historic reasons.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:22):**  And at this point many people don't have access to their own plot of land and they rent it.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:28):**  So if you're going to invest hundreds of hours of time in creating a system that's sustainable  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:37):**  and that replenishes your soil and next year you're going to have to lose that piece of  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:41):**  land and go to a different property, why would you invest in that land?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:46):**  Why would you invest in that land instead of just putting fertilizer?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:50):**  Well obviously it's a very intense question because ideally we live in enough of a sense  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:26:56):**  of community, we know that that land is also going to benefit someone else next year and  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:00):**  that maybe they'll also take care of it and if we all started managing our land sustainably  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:05):**  then we'd all benefit in the long term.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:08):**  But we're not at that level socially yet, in the world.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:13):**  We're not at that level anywhere in the world where we can really understand ourselves as  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:17):**  a hype.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:19):**  Everything I do can benefit someone else even if it's not benefiting me immediately.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:26):**  We can talk about this forever.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:28):**  Please do.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:29):**  But I think that kind of answers your first question.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:41):**  But talking about externalities, one of the reasons why I think there is a huge problem  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:48):**  in Guatemala in terms of agriculture is because we've allowed corporations to externalize  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:27:55):**  their damage in the ecology of the whole country.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:01):**  We don't measure, for example, the government doesn't even have the capacity to follow through  
**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:09):**  with the laws that do exist so that people protect the water sources that we have.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:16):**  So 96% of our rivers are completely polluted.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:22):**  The government allows companies to plant into the mangroves because it means a better bottom  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:32):**  line and those kind of problems are common, too common.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:38):**  They have incredible impact on the people who are trying to do agriculture in the proper  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:42):**  way.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:43):**  We just had a really sad situation with one of our producers where we're possibly not  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:48):**  going to be able to buy from them because the people around them are contaminating them  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:55):**  by spraying with airplanes, light aircraft.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:28:59):**  So the producer is phenomenal.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:02):**  She is treating her cattle in such an amazing way.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:07):**  She's creating this silver pastoral system that's phenomenal, so intelligent.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:17):**  And yet since we have a promise to our clients to only sell and manage items that are organic  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:25):**  and sustainably harvested and are safe to eat, we can't buy from her.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:30):**  Not because her processes aren't fantastic but because people around her have been allowed  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:35):**  to externalize their costs and their impacts and that's negatively affecting everyone.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:42):**  That's affecting them, that's affecting us, that's affecting producers and we're not even  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:48):**  aware of it.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:49):**  So many people are not even aware of what that means yet.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:52):**  Right.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:53):**  And I mean that's the thing.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:29:55):**  It's like if you, I admit I deliberately threw you a curve ball there and asked you a ridiculously  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:01):**  hard question to answer only because I knew you'd do a great job.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:06):**  And also partly I wanted to highlight just how complex these issues are and just how  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:10):**  multifaceted they are.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:14):**  And what I wanted to ask you guys is like based on the complexity of all these issues,  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:19):**  do you see a sort of a rising levels of awareness of these things among your clientele, among  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:27):**  the people you're interacting with there and around Antigua and Guatemala City?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:32):**  Definitely.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:33):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:34):**  Without question.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:35):**  There is and there will continue to be that trend and we've seen it worldwide and for  
**[0:30:40-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:40):**  many people here it starts off as a fad but then they really understand how profoundly  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:48):**  well it influences their life, how it makes everything in their life so much better to  
**[0:30:52-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:52):**  be aware and to be connected and to be eating healthy things that nourish them.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:30:59):**  And not only that but even in engaging themselves enough to what's happening in the world to  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:07):**  give themselves the responsibility to take action.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:11):**  Yeah, it's so interesting.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:14):**  I've seen that before with people who start into the organic food movement as a fad but  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:20):**  it's just those first steps, maybe getting your own garden, starting to interact with  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:26):**  nature and it really takes people in some spectacular directions.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:31):**  You know, Neil, I tell people this all the time but I think that in the future we're  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:35):**  not even going to have to make a choice between conventional and organic.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:40):**  That's how much I think that this movement is growing and I see the trend.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:44):**  There's global demand increasing in Europe, in the States, in other countries around the  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:50):**  world for organic food.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:51):**  So basically what we're seeing right now is a bubble for organic food but that's not going  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:57):**  to be like that for much longer.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:31:59):**  You know, in the future if you go to a supermarket everything that's going to be in the market  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:03):**  is going to be organic.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:04):**  So I definitely, definitely agree with Julie that it's growing and it will continue to  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:09):**  grow.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:11):**  And so with that in mind, given that you guys are like on and contributing to what we hope  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:18):**  is going to be a major wave in Guatemala, what are some of the directions you want to  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:23):**  take La Botica Verde in?  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:25):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:27):**  You want me to answer or do you?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:30):**  Well I think we can both answer it.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:32):**  You know in the big, big picture we'd like to position ourselves as the main distributor  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:38):**  for organic produce that has a follow up with their producers, that actually connects the  
**[0:32:45-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:45):**  client and the producer and that allows the producers their own creativity in designing  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:32:53):**  their landscapes and their ecosystems within the market values.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:02):**  And I mean that's the big picture.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:05):**  I see us moving across the region, you know going into Nicaragua and Salvador and maybe  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:12):**  even Mexico.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:13):**  And that's, I mean that's my dream is to change this substantially enough that it actually  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:21):**  has sway in the future development of the country.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:25):**  I think the interesting thing right now, yeah go ahead.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:29):**  Yeah I was going to say kind of like create a tipping point almost right?  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:34):**  Contribute to that.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:35):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:36):**  I mean the interesting thing is that there are already a ton of organic producers in  
**[0:33:43-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:43):**  the region and like I mentioned before there is growing demand locally.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:50):**  And right now the perception is that even a grower organic you need to export.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:33:55):**  Whereas what we're trying to prove is that there is enough local demand in the region  
**[0:34:02-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:02):**  that suppliers could tap into and not big suppliers like small holders and medium sized  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:10):**  farms can also have access to these markets locally.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:14):**  So we definitely think that there is a big opportunity in the region to connect more  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:19):**  of these organic producers with local demand.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:24):**  And then what about this issue because for me it is an issue because I also work as a  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:29):**  sort of agricultural consultant and I travel all around the world.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:32):**  And what it occurs to me that like real regenerative agriculture not just using organic compost  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:39):**  instead of fertilizer.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:41):**  It's quite a knowledge intensive system.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:43):**  If it's done well it's actually not that labor intensive and that's what good design can  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:48):**  do.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:49):**  But in terms of supporting and growing your ring of producers and building capacity, do  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:34:59):**  you have any ideas or any plans in that area?  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:04):**  That's really an essential part of the business is that we want to and we said this since  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:10):**  the very beginning of developing our business that we want to be beyond organic.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:14):**  We don't want to just check a list of what does organic mean and just satisfy that.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:20):**  No, we want to go far beyond that.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:21):**  So we are working with producers really closely in helping them design their land to have  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:29):**  the diversity that it needs to have to have the rotation systems it has to have.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:34):**  And obviously this is a work in progress and I mean from how we started to where we are  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:39):**  now I'd say that there is movement.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:44):**  It has been a huge effort and it's not at all going to be immediate.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:51):**  But I think that in the extent that they see that their work is valued, that it's being  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:35:58):**  economic valued and that they have so many sums.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:03):**  Part of our dream is that it's not just about me, it's about putting all our producers together  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:09):**  and having a network and a dialogue where each person can say like, oh, this has worked  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:14):**  really well for me, this strategy has worked really well for me in this region.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:19):**  How has that been for you?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:20):**  How can we put together and collaborate to keep increasing this set of options that we  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:28):**  have as producers?  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:32):**  Because hopefully the same ripple effect that can be created in consumers can also be created  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:38):**  in producers, right?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:39):**  When people start to see, oh, wow, it's cheaper and less effort to grow ecologically just  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:46):**  the same way as the consumers start to have these realizations and tipping points start  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:51):**  to happen, right?  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:52):**  Right, exactly.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:36:53):**  There is a tipping point and I think that interestingly enough it's not about having  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:00):**  the information, it's about having the market.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:03):**  Because I can go to all the producers and show them and explain permaculture principles  
**[0:37:09-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:09):**  and agroecology and take them to ugly dirty rivers and monocultures of cane and be like,  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:17):**  see, this is how the world is getting ruined.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:20):**  But that's not going to make them or even allow them to change if there isn't a market  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:25):**  behind it.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:26):**  And that's why it really takes each of us, like you guys, us, absolutely anyone listening  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:31):**  to this podcast to find the need that they're in, where they can influence, where they can  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:36):**  change the world and create a system that's sustainable in the three ways that Michelle  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:41):**  stated before.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:42):**  It has to have a market, otherwise you can talk to death about it and it's not going  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:47):**  to really create a change because at the end of the day people right now in the system  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:52):**  that we've created as a society, we do need money to exchange goods.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:37:58):**  And that may change, I hope it does change in the future where each person can just do  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:02):**  what they love and somehow it all pans out.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:05):**  So where we are now, we do need that market value and each entrepreneur produces that  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:13):**  market value.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:15):**  I think maybe to add a little bit to that, I see it a lot as incentives and without the  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:23):**  right incentive, which is exactly what Julia is explaining, you can talk to someone and  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:27):**  explain all the benefits, but people need to feel like it's something that is in their  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:32):**  interest as well.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:33):**  And it's the same thing with natives, for example, like we in Guatemala, we have amazing  
**[0:38:38-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:38):**  native nutritional foods, we have super foods here, so it really makes no sense why we're  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:45):**  importing super foods.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:47):**  But it's the same thing, like if there is no market that wants to buy those things,  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:53):**  farmers don't see an interest in continuing to grow them.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:38:57):**  So a big part of the work that we're doing right now is trying to promote native nutritional  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:02):**  foods so that we can prove that there are enough people out there who want them and  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:07):**  then farmers will want to continue growing them.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:11):**  Yeah, great stuff.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:13):**  All right, listen, I could stay here talking to you guys all day, but unfortunately I think  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:21):**  I'm running out of time.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:22):**  So what I'd like to finish up with is maybe how people who've heard this can find out  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:29):**  more about you guys, how they can get in touch, support, you know, where can people find out  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:35):**  more information about you guys and what you're doing?  
**[0:39:39-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-la-botica-verde/#t=0:39:39):**  So we are on social media, you can find us using at La Botica Verde and you can write

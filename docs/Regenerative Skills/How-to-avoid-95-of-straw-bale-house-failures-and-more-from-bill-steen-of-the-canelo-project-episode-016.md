**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:09):**  Let's go for it.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:11):**  So for those of us who are listening who are unfamiliar a little bit with your backstory,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:15):**  tell us how you got started in natural building and how The Canelo Project began.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:21):**  Let's see.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:23):**  Well, that's not an easy one, but we can take it back to...  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:29):**  I mean, my life basically has been dedicated to doing different things, alternative things  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:35):**  all the way back, let's say into the 60s when it was more sort of consciousness focused.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:42):**  And from there I ended up running an early community yoga ashram back in the 70s.  
**[0:02:52-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:02:52):**  And finally I decided I really wanted to get back to my roots, which was for this part  
**[0:03:01-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:01):**  of the world, working with Adobe, organic gardening had come into existence for maybe  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:10):**  10, 15 years by then.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:12):**  And I'd started there before I got into running the community that I was.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:20):**  So it was more a desire to go back to those things that took me to focusing more on building  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:29):**  as well.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:31):**  And so in that process I just happened to meet a friend who had worked on some of the  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:37):**  early straw bale buildings.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:39):**  And so for me I started seeing it because I grew up in an Adobe house in this part of  
**[0:03:44-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:44):**  the world, I started to realize while living in it that it just doesn't insulate that well.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:52):**  So the early thing I began envisioning was sort of a marriage between clay, Adobe, straw  
**[0:03:57-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:03:57):**  bales as a way of getting almost the same look, but basically with an insulated wall.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:04:06):**  And that was kind of the beginnings of where I am now.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:04:13):**  And so shortly thereafter I met Athena and together we basically, well on one hand started  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:04:25):**  a new family with new kids.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:04:28):**  We launched into this work together, we put out the book The Straw Bale House, and the  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:04:35):**  rest has sort of carried us right to where we are now.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:04:40):**  Fantastic.

**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:04:46):**  Bale House and The Beauty of Straw Bale Homes.

**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:04:57):**  focus but sometimes events and life kind of takes you away.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:05:03):**  And what happened was that this friend that I mentioned who had introduced me to the concept  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:05:11):**  of building with straw bales, he and I had done this little booklet, probably, I don't

**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:05:32):**  we could find.

**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:13:43):**  And so you can imagine in putting a clay finish on walls, it's going to be a little bit more  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:13:49):**  sensitive to moisture than let's say, ah, let's say perceptively you're going to think  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:13:57):**  that because you're going to see some wear maybe on the earthen finishes.

**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:14:18):**  they tend to soak up water, soak up moisture and take it directly to the straw.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:14:24):**  So I think that's one of the early things that we figured out.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:14:28):**  And then we also kind of advanced.

**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:14:36):**  No, it's just through the material itself.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:14:39):**  Really?

**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:14:42):**  They may not necessarily wear on the surface, but they will soak up water.

**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:15:07):**  for the quantity and the amount of moisture.

**[0:15:17-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:15:17):**  And the thing that we did was we evolved sort of a plastering system that instead of thinking  
**[0:15:27-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:15:27):**  about it like using the clay in the earth like a conventional masonry stuck over plaster,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:15:37):**  we started combining it with very large quantities of straw.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:15:43):**  And so the result of that, interestingly enough, was that we ended up with a finish that although  
**[0:15:50-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:15:50):**  it might wear, it wears very slowly and it lasts for a long, long time.

**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:16:05):**  we could get an inch and a half to two inches of coverage in terms of depth in one application.

**[0:32:24-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:32:24):**  And in that process, we started experimenting with Nubian bolts and domes.

**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:32:55):**  Because you don't get great adhesion between lime and earthen substrates.

**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-how-to-avoid-95-of-straw-bale-house-failures-and-more-from-bill-steen-of-the-canelo-project-episode-015/#t=0:34:02):**  So we started putting the work and effort into our place here, which we'd really ignored

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 27 Nov 2020 07:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:40):**  Before we jump into today's episode, I want to invite all of you to an event that I'm  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:44):**  super excited about and that's been a long time in the making.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:48):**  One of the projects that's kept me busy over the last few months is a new platform  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:51):**  for knowledge sharing and connection between regenerative farmers, their communities and  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:56):**  their clients called Climate Farmers.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:00:59):**  Climate Farmers is a European movement for a systemic change in agriculture towards regenerative  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:03):**  practices that promote climate and ecosystem protection, access to food of the highest  
**[0:01:08-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:08):**  quality, epic flavor and maximum nutrient density without chemicals or harmful substances.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:15):**  This not only promotes biodiversity, but also ensures long term food security in times of  
**[0:01:20-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:20):**  changing climate.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:21):**  We're creating the infrastructure for the large scale and rapid transition needed to  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:25):**  ensure that farming practices are ready for the future.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:29):**  The best part is that I'll be hosting a panel discussion between four of the most  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:32):**  prominent figures in regenerative agriculture and you can be there live!  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:37):**  Join us at 4pm Central European Time this upcoming Monday the 30th of November to hear  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:42):**  from Richard Perkins, John Kempf, Patrick Worms and Benedict Bozell about their perspectives  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:48):**  on the current state of agriculture, the changes that need to happen for a regenerative transition  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:53):**  and the steps to get us there.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:01:55):**  There are a limited number of free registrations for this event so don't wait to sign up!  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:00):**  Follow the registration link on the show notes for this episode to reserve your space today.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:04):**  I'm looking forward to seeing you there!  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:06):**  Alright friends and family, welcome back!  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:09):**  Now after last week's session with Matt Powers, I wanted to add a second perspective on soil  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:14):**  and the new science behind how we can restore it to health in our own gardens.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:18):**  And so for that perspective, I got back in touch with Robert Pavlis, who was first on  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:22):**  this show a few seasons ago to talk about building natural ponds.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:26):**  Robert has been an avid gardener for over four decades.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:29):**  He's the owner and developer of Aspen Grove Gardens, a six-acre botanical garden that  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:33):**  features over 3,000 varieties of plants.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:37):**  As a specialist in soil science, he has been the instructor for Landscape Ontario and is  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:41):**  a garden blogger, writer, and chemist.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:44):**  He teaches gardening fundamentals at the University of Guelph and garden design in the city of  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:49):**  Guelph, Ontario, where he lives.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:51):**  One of the things that I most appreciate about Robert's work is that he's not afraid to  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:55):**  challenge any entrenched gardening belief or myth.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:02:58):**  He's always looking to get at the bottom of what helps plants to grow and what's just  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:02):**  marketing scams.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:04):**  In this episode, we really dive in deep into the fundamentals of soil composition and understanding  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:09):**  the nutrients that plants need to thrive.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:12):**  We talk about looking at soil as an ecosystem unto itself rather than a living material,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:17):**  and why striving for ideal soil is not as important as making sure that you have the  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:21):**  components necessary for the life inside of it.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:24):**  Robert also helps me to understand what happens in the ground after tillage, mulching, and  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:29):**  other amendments.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:30):**  We go over simple tests that you can do to diagnose your soil without special equipment  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:34):**  or needing to pay for laboratory testing, and by the end, how you can use these results  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:40):**  to make your own personalized soil plan.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:44):**  This episode alone is like a short but thorough course on soil health, so you might want to  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:49):**  keep a notebook handy.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:50):**  For those of you who want to really expand your knowledge on soil science, I've teamed  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:54):**  up with New Society Publishers to give away a free copy of this book.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:03:58):**  If you want to win a copy of Soil Science for Gardeners, just message me through our  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:02):**  dedicated Facebook group called Abundant Edge Weekly Regenerative Skills, and write a post  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:07):**  about why you want to amend the soil on your site.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:09):**  I'll select a winner one week after this episode comes out and send a hard copy of  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:14):**  the book if you live in the United States or Canada, or a digital copy if you live anywhere  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:18):**  else in the world.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:19):**  It's that simple.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:20):**  Plus, you'll be joining an incredible group of listeners like you who are sharing their  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:23):**  regenerative living journey and learning experiences with the community.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:28):**  You can either look for the group directly on Facebook or I'll put a button to take  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:31):**  you right there in the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:34):**  So with that out of the way and a lot of ground to cover, I'll hand it over to Robert.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:38):**  Hey Robert, thanks for taking the time to be on the podcast again.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:41):**  How have you been?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:42):**  Oh, I've been really great and busy.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:45):**  Sounds like it.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:46):**  You've got a new book coming out, you've been keeping up with the blog, you've got  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:49):**  all sorts of things going on.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:51):**  So look, we did the last interview about your book on building natural ponds, which was  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:58):**  great.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:04:59):**  It was actually one of my most successful episodes of that season.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:02):**  And you've got a new book out on basically getting to know everything about the science  
**[0:05:07-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:07):**  and the basic troubleshooting of soil, which a lot of gardeners just, it's one of the most  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:15):**  ignored aspects of taking care of plants.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:19):**  So what do you say we kind of jump into talking about the specifics of soil and I'll direct  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:25):**  anybody who's interested on knowing more about ponds and of course your background to the  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:30):**  previous episode.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:31):**  Yeah?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:32):**  Okay, it works for me.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:34):**  All right, so look, soil is really at the root of everything, as you know, no pun intended.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:40):**  Let's start with how you define healthy soil, because depending on what you're looking for,  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:45):**  the definition can change drastically, right?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:48):**  Yeah, it's actually kind of interesting that there aren't proper official definitions for  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:54):**  many of these things.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:05:57):**  And so healthy soil is a very vague concept.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:01):**  People talk about soil that makes plants grow well, so that's healthy soil, which is kind  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:08):**  of a useless definition really.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:11):**  I guess healthy soil is soil that has a good community of life growing in it, and plants  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:20):**  are just one aspect of that.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:24):**  Because we're gardeners, we focus on the plants, and because most of this other life is too  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:30):**  small to see, we kind of ignore it.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:34):**  And I think most gardeners know there's things in there, there's some fungi and microbes  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:38):**  and bacteria and things, but we don't really spend a lot of time thinking about it.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:46):**  But it turns out that that life in the soil is absolutely critical to good plant growth  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:52):**  in the soil.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:06:55):**  Now you can grow plants hydroponically, so you can make the argument you don't even need  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:00):**  soil.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:01):**  But if you're going to grow plants in the ground and you're trying to put sort of a  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:06):**  landscape type system in place, gardening becomes so much easier once you have a healthy  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:14):**  soil system.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:16):**  And a big part of that is what is living in soil, but the other part that's really important  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:22):**  is the soil structure.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:26):**  And a lot of people aren't really aware that soil has this structure.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:31):**  We know it has things like sands, tilt, and clay in it, and certainly people who have  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:36):**  very sandy soil know that because it's a real problem to keep plants watered and to keep  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:42):**  them fertilized because sand doesn't actually hold any nutrients.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:47):**  So if you fertilize sandy soil, it just runs through the soil.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:51):**  And if you're on sand, you learn that pretty quickly.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:55):**  At the other extreme, you've got people who've got really heavy clay soils, and those are  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:07:59):**  hard to work, they're slimy when they're wet, they stick to everything.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:04):**  So people with clay soil certainly know they have that.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:07):**  What a lot of people don't know is that clay soil is actually really great because it actually  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:14):**  holds nutrients.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:16):**  So when we put fertilizer on the ground, you can think of clay as actually absorbing and  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:21):**  sucking up these nutrients and holding them until the plants can use them.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:26):**  So clay soil is actually better than sandy soil, but we really want a mixture of both  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:31):**  of those.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:32):**  Yeah, so a lot of my listeners who've been keeping up with the different topics that  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:38):**  I've covered on the podcast up until now will know that we talked about structure of soil  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:43):**  much more in the context of natural building.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:45):**  We've talked about the clay content and the sand content much more when it comes to creating  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:50):**  building materials such as adobe or cob or rammed earth.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:55):**  But this, like you just mentioned, has a real effect on the composition and the access for  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:08:59):**  nutrients for plants as well.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:02):**  So your book, Soil Science for Gardeners, is divided now into three sections that guide  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:08):**  readers through a deeper understanding of soils.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:11):**  So though you've already started explaining the structure, let's start even further back  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:16):**  from the beginning and understanding what soil is by definition.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:20):**  So one of my favorite things that you start out by saying is that soil is an ecosystem  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:25):**  and not a living organism itself.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:28):**  Can you explain that a little?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:29):**  Yeah, this is kind of a personal beef of mine.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:34):**  People go around talking about soil as if it's alive.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:39):**  The proper definition of soil, and there is an international association who figures this  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:45):**  out, does not include the living aspects of soil.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:50):**  So it's only dead organic matter and all of the mineral components.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:56):**  So soil is not living.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:09:58):**  It's a completely dead material.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:01):**  So this idea of having to feed soil and to nurture it and take care of soil and so on  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:06):**  doesn't make any sense because it's not alive.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:10):**  But there is the concept of a soil ecosystem, just like you might have a bog ecosystem.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:19):**  And in that ecosystem now, we have the soil as well as all the living components.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:25):**  And now we include the plants and the microbes and the dewworms and everything else that  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:31):**  is in that.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:32):**  And when you take that all as an area and we look at all of that, now that's a soil  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:38):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:39):**  It's still not alive, but it has living things in it.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:47):**  And I think people really need to understand the difference between the two.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:50):**  Yeah, it almost seems like the terminology that we have at this point is kind of inadequate  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:10:55):**  because like you said, soil gets used as a term for an entire ecosystem as if you were  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:00):**  talking about a desert and all of the things that it contains, right?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:06):**  Because what most of us think of as soil is the sum of a whole ton of parts.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:11):**  You could talk about the minerals, the microbiota life, the fungi, the solutions that are created  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:19):**  in the water and every other component and minerals or vitamins in that.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:24):**  But let's talk about defining ideal soil for the gardener or the farmer.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:30):**  This is kind of an elusive term because though it's fairly well defined as kind of an idealistic  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:38):**  set, it doesn't occur very often in nature, right?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:42):**  No.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:43):**  I mean, if you get a textbook, it'll tell you what ideal soil is, but virtually nobody  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:48):**  has that.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:50):**  And the important thing that gardeners need to understand is it is not your job to make  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:56):**  ideal soil.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:11:57):**  So I think sometimes people come away with this idea, well, this is perfect soil so I  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:03):**  want to do whatever I can to get there.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:07):**  And that's just not possible.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:08):**  So nobody has perfect soil and you can't make perfect soil.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:14):**  So what you have to do as a gardener is make your soil as good as you can given your starting  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:23):**  point.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:24):**  And mostly the starting point are the minerals.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:27):**  Whatever sand, silt, and clay you have, that's what you have and you really can't change  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:31):**  that very much.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:33):**  Unless you're going to bring in big excavators and big trucks and move a lot of soil, you're  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:38):**  sort of stuck with what you have.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:41):**  And so now the job of a gardener to create healthy soil is to start there and then improve  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:49):**  on that.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:50):**  Let's talk about then the components of soil.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:53):**  First of all, what are the components that in a textbook would define that ideal soil  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:12:58):**  that we just glossed over?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:00):**  And then we can kind of break down the components that people need to kind of have as far as  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:05):**  a knowledge of the terms so that we can continue forward.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:08):**  Sure.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:09):**  So the mineral components should be in the order of 40% clay, 40% sand, and the rest  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:19):**  silt.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:20):**  So that you have a bit of each of those.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:24):**  There's another component that's absolutely critical and that's the organic material.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:31):**  But the organic material is actually a very small part of ideal soil.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:34):**  So if we look at the soil part and we exclude water and oxygen for now, organic material  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:44):**  is only 5% of that soil.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:49):**  And I think we think, well geez, there's got to be all this carbon in the soil and all  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:53):**  this organic material.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:13:54):**  But in fact, it's a very small percentage of the soil.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:00):**  The other two components that are important there is the oxygen and water.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:05):**  And something that I think surprises a lot of people, and in fact it surprised me when  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:11):**  I first seen it.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:12):**  I really didn't believe it.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:13):**  I had to verify that this was actually correct.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:17):**  But soil has 25% air in it.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:22):**  So it's about 25% air, 25% water, and the other 50% is minerals and organic matter.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:32):**  And that air is vital to plant growth.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:37):**  So most people know that plants photosynthesize and they get CO2 from the air and with that  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:44):**  and sunlight they make food for the plant.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:48):**  What a lot of people don't realize is that plants also breathe oxygen just like animals  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:53):**  do.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:14:54):**  So we breathe in oxygen and give off CO2 and plants do the same thing, both in the leaves  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:01):**  but mostly they do it in their roots.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:03):**  So it's absolutely vital that plant roots absorb oxygen.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:09):**  And so the amount of oxygen in your soil is really important and you need to get that  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:15):**  up to a higher level.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:17):**  And in many soils that's a real problem.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:20):**  It's not so much nutrients, it's the oxygen that's in the soil.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:23):**  Sure, for an absence of oxygen you start to get anaerobic conditions which can throw off  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:28):**  the pH and so many other things and reduce the life that's sustaining and making nutrients  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:34):**  accessible to plant roots.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:36):**  Let's now talk about how to identify or diagnose your own soil so that at least you know what  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:41):**  you're working with from the beginning.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:42):**  Okay, so this is one of the things that I do in the book is that there's several tests  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:47):**  in there that you can do yourself and then there's other tasks that you really want to  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:53):**  do through a lab.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:55):**  So the one most people want to do is the nutrient test.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:15:58):**  They want to find out how many nutrients they have in their soil.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:03):**  And you can get kits from most nurseries, the do it yourself type kits.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:09):**  They have limited value because they don't actually give you a number.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:15):**  So if I use that kit and I test for phosphorus for example, I either get a low, medium or  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:22):**  high value.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:24):**  So let's say I have a low value and I say look at it and say okay I need to add some  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:27):**  phosphorus to my soil, how much should I add?  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:30):**  Well I have no idea because I don't actually have a number.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:34):**  I only have a relative value that says low.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:39):**  So I don't know if I have to add a little bit or a whole bunch.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:43):**  And that's one of the limitations of the soil kits that are sold to gardeners.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:49):**  If you send your sample to a soil lab they'll actually give you a number and they'll say  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:16:53):**  this is the amount of phosphorus in your soil and here's how much you should add to bring  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:00):**  it up to a level so you can grow your plants.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:04):**  And that's much more useful.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:07):**  One of the limitations of soil tests for nutrients is that generally they don't test for nitrogen.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:14):**  And of all the nutrients that might be missing from your soil, nitrogen is probably the one  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:20):**  that's most likely missing and yet labs don't test for it.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:24):**  And the reason they don't do that is because the nitrogen levels change very quickly.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:29):**  So by the time you gather a soil sample and send it down to the lab, the amount of nitrogen  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:36):**  in your soil has already changed.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:38):**  So getting a result doesn't help you very much.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:41):**  So nitrogen is continually changing and it's being washed away.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:46):**  After heavy rain you have less nitrogen and so on.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:49):**  And so that's one of the limitations of testing for nutrients.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:54):**  But there are other things that you also want to test.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:17:56):**  So if you don't know how much sand, silt, and clay you have in your soil, there is a  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:00):**  nice home test that you can do.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:04):**  And I actually have a video on the soil texture triangle and how to do that test.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:09):**  And it's helpful because then it gives you an idea of how much clay you have and how  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:14):**  well that will hold nutrients and so on.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:17):**  So that's a test you can do.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:19):**  Is it the texture one or the one with the solution in the jar?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:23):**  That's the solution in a jar.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:25):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:26):**  That's another one that we've used in natural building that kind of give you an idea of  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:29):**  ratios of sand, silt, and clay.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:31):**  So people who have listened to this might already know that one.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:35):**  Okay.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:36):**  The other one that's pretty easy to do is a compaction test.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:40):**  And you can buy an expensive piece of equipment to do this.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:45):**  But for most gardeners I just take a wire, a fairly stiff straight wire, and you push  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:51):**  it in the soil and see how far you can push it down before it starts to bend.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:18:58):**  And what you want to do is you want to compare the soil where you have your garden to some  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:03):**  natural soil nearby.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:06):**  So ideally soil that hasn't been disturbed too much.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:10):**  It'd be great if you're near a wilder field or something or a forest.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:16):**  Sometimes you can use your fence line because people don't walk right along the soil on  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:20):**  your fence line and they don't do anything there.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:23):**  So that's so it's usually not compacted too much.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:27):**  So you measure that and then compare it to your garden.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:31):**  But where it's very useful is to measure your soil every year to see how you're improving  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:36):**  it.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:37):**  And compaction is a real problem in many areas, particularly newer home developments.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:46):**  The topsoil gets removed, then they bring in the big excavators and all the heavy equipment  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:54):**  and you run over the soil over and over and over again and you pack that way down.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:19:59):**  Then they put a little couple inches of topsoil back and you're supposed to create a garden  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:04):**  out of that.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:05):**  And what that compaction does is it squeezes out all that air that we want.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:10):**  So suddenly your soil doesn't have enough air in it and plant roots don't grow very  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:16):**  well.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:17):**  So compaction is an indirect measure of how much air you have in your soil.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:22):**  And compaction is probably one of the worst things, one of the biggest problems that gardeners  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:28):**  have in their soil.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:31):**  There's also a percolation test that you can do where you in effect dig a little hole and  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:37):**  fill it with water, let the water run away.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:41):**  Then you come back the next day, put some more water in and measure how fast that water  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:46):**  runs away.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:48):**  If the hole is full and it sits there, then you don't have very good drainage.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:54):**  You have a real problem.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:20:55):**  If it runs away completely, then you're probably sitting on very sandy soil and nothing's holding  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:01):**  that water in place.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:03):**  And since water is one of the big components of healthy soil, you want that water to sit  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:11):**  for a while so it soaks in and plants have an opportunity to absorb some.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:15):**  But you don't want it to sit too long because now plant roots are sitting in water and they  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:21):**  can't get any air.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:23):**  So that's why the percolation test is useful to do too.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:27):**  And it's very easy for a homeowner to do that.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:31):**  It seems like with all of these you're looking for a mid-range, almost the Goldilocks and  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:36):**  the Three Bears kind of philosophy that anything too far from one side or the other is not  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:42):**  ideal.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:43):**  You're looking for a balance in all of these tests.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:46):**  That's correct.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:47):**  And what I do in my book is I actually go through these tests and I give you some values  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:21:54):**  and I tell you that this value is too low or this one is too high and you kind of rate  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:01):**  your soil based on what value you actually get.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:06):**  So while we're on the subject of tests, do you want to talk about one of my favorites  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:10):**  from the book that I had never heard of before, the Tidy Whitey test?  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:15):**  Well I kind of threw that one in as a little fun thing that most people read hopefully  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:21):**  and kind of enjoy.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:23):**  But it actually works and it was developed by one of the universities in the States and  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:28):**  what you essentially do is take a pair of underwear and bury it.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:34):**  Now these have to be cotton underwear.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:38):**  And cotton of course is made from plants and it decomposes just like other plant material.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:46):**  So you take your underwear, you put it in the soil, you wait for a certain period of  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:51):**  time and then you dig it up and have a look at it.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:22:54):**  And if it's completely decomposed that means you have a lot of microbes in your soil.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:01):**  You have a very healthy microbe community that has come along and started decomposing  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:06):**  that cotton.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:08):**  If you dig it up and most of the underwear is still there it means you don't have a very  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:12):**  healthy community of microbes.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:14):**  How long do they leave it in there again?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:18):**  I can't remember.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:21):**  I think in the book it says something like five or eight weeks, somewhere between there.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:25):**  Something like that.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:26):**  Yeah okay so it's a little while.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:28):**  Yeah it's a little while.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:32):**  But it actually is again a relatively good test and it actually works.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:39):**  And the scientists have actually tried it in different types of soils where they know  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:44):**  the quality of the soils.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:46):**  And it's a pretty good indicator of how many microbes you have.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:49):**  Yeah I love that one because I really hadn't heard anything as far as a test for microbiotic  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:55):**  life.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:23:56):**  Only recently have we really discovered how important that is to the actual health of  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:01):**  the ecosystem within the soils.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:03):**  And it seems just like one of those cute and super easy to do things that you can do at  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:09):**  home that gives you a fairly accurate result.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:14):**  That's right.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:16):**  And it's actually quite interesting and this whole thing about making healthy soil ends  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:22):**  up being all about microbes.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:24):**  That's the secret sauce to healthy soil.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:28):**  And as gardeners we have actually no way to measure that.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:32):**  So if you look at soil and you want to say okay how healthy is it?  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:37):**  Well you have to know how many microbes you have.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:39):**  But you have no way of measuring that.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:43):**  There are some indirect ways and so the underwear test is one of them.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:50):**  The other one is dewworms.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:52):**  So you can actually do a counting of dewworms.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:24:54):**  So you take a square yard of soil and you dig it up and you measure how many worms you  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:02):**  have in there.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:03):**  And the number of dewworms is an indicator of micropopulations because the earthworm's  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:12):**  main diet is bacteria.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:14):**  And so the more bacteria you have in the soil the more dewworms you'll have.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:19):**  And so it's an indirect measure.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:22):**  But we don't really have any good way of knowing what's in our soil.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:26):**  And yet those microbes is the most important thing in our soil.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:32):**  So let's talk about another aspect of soil health that people put a whole lot of importance  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:37):**  on but can sometimes be misleading.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:39):**  And of course this is the pH or acidity or alkalinity of soil.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:43):**  Can you talk a little bit about what it really means and how it affects the way plants grow?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:50):**  Alright so pH is a measure of how much acidity you have in the soil.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:25:59):**  If I word that correctly it's actually a measure of how many hydrogen ions we have in the soil.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:05):**  Most people call it acidity.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:09):**  Now it turns out that plants actually don't care what the pH of soil is.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:15):**  They're not very fussy.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:19):**  But there is an indirect problem for plants and that is that plants need to absorb nutrients.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:26):**  And at certain pH levels some nutrients stick too hard to soil and plants can't get to them.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:34):**  So iron is one of them for instance.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:37):**  If my soil pH goes too high the iron sticks to the soil and plants can't get it.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:45):**  And so then plants show signs of iron deficiency which is interveinal chlorosis, a yellowing  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:52):**  of the leaves between the veins.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:26:56):**  So the plant looks like it doesn't have enough iron but there's lots of iron in the soil.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:03):**  The problem is the pH is so high that the plants can't get at the iron.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:08):**  So there's an indirect reason why we have to have a certain pH because plants can only  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:15):**  get their nutrients at certain pHs.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:18):**  And for most plants that range turns out to be somewhere around 6.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:23):**  Sort of 6.5 to 5.5 is a very good range where most plants can get most nutrients.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:32):**  Now there are some plants that are not as good at getting these nutrients and they need  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:38):**  a lower pH.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:39):**  And those are the plants like rhododendrons and blueberries and azaleas and they're called  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:45):**  acid loving plants.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:48):**  Well they don't actually like the acid so much but that's the only way that they can  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:52):**  get the nutrients out of the soil is with a low pH.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:27:57):**  So indirectly pH is important.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:00):**  And so these are the plants that have kind of naturally grown accustomed to like bogs  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:06):**  and wetland areas where the pH tends to be more acidic because of anaerobic conditions  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:13):**  of like wet soils?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:15):**  Sure the same thing applies there.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:18):**  It is all about really absorbing nutrients not so much pH.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:25):**  In fact high pH is generally not a problem for plants provided they can get the nutrients.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:35):**  Plants can grow in quite high pHs without any harm at all to the plants.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:40):**  But they have to have access to those nutrients.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:44):**  So a lot of gardeners have heard this.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:46):**  We know about pH.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:48):**  We know the range that plants kind of like to have.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:53):**  And so gardeners have this feel, they feel the need to make the perfect pH for their  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:28:59):**  plants.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:01):**  And that's a bit of a fallacy.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:04):**  For the majority of plants unless you have very acidic soil they will grow fine.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:12):**  Even if you have a pH of 8 most plants will still grow fine in a pH of 8.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:18):**  And it's better for you not to try to change your pH because in most soil that's really  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:23):**  hard to do.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:25):**  I know that there's lots of information on the internet that says oh put some peat moss  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:30):**  in your soil.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:32):**  I've done that experiment and peat moss is acidic but the minute you put it into alkaline  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:39):**  soil within a week the acidity is gone.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:42):**  So adding peat moss does nothing to acidify soil.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:47):**  The same with pine needles which is another very common myth that pine needles are acidic.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:52):**  And it turns out A that they're really not acidic or they're just very slightly acidic  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:29:58):**  when they're on the tree and by the time they fall off and they're brown they're not acidic  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:02):**  and does nothing to acidify soil.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:06):**  So if you need to acidify soil you can use sulfur which is probably your best choice.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:14):**  But a much better choice is not to acidify soil and to grow plants for the pH that you  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:21):**  have.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:22):**  You know so I have alkaline soil it's about a 7.4.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:27):**  I don't try to grow rhododendrons.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:29):**  They don't grow around here.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:31):**  Same with blueberries.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:32):**  I can't really grow blueberries unless I put them in a container and continually put in  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:37):**  acidic compounds to keep the soil acidic.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:40):**  So I just don't grow those plants.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:43):**  People have more acidic soil than they grow plants that like acidic soil and leave the  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:49):**  ones that need alkaline soil alone.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:52):**  So for most people it's best not to try to adjust your pH.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:30:58):**  It's valuable to know what it is so you can pick the right plants but adjusting it is  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:07):**  a never ending thing that you're going to have to do every year from now till the end  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:10):**  of your life.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:11):**  So it's just not worth doing.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:12):**  Yeah better not to force it.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:14):**  So on this kind of subject indirectly of the nutrients I know that's another one of those  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:19):**  kind of fussy subjects that a lot of gardening gurus have very strong opinions on.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:25):**  And there seems to be kind of a dogmatic adherence to the NPK the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:34):**  like macronutrients.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:37):**  And I think you mentioned too in the book that most soils are fine on micronutrients.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:43):**  So like tell me kind of your opinion your stance on the nutrients side of things.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:49):**  So I'll probably disagree with a lot of people here.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:54):**  So let's talk micronutrients first.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:31:57):**  Unless you have very sandy soil your soil probably has all the micronutrients it needs.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:06):**  Now that's assuming that you have some clay in the soil and that there is some level of  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:11):**  organic matter in the soil.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:15):**  And as long as you have those two things you probably do not have a nutrient deficiency.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:20):**  Now there's going to be exceptions.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:21):**  I mean there's a million different kinds of soils and I'm sure there's a listener somewhere  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:26):**  out there who says I know that my soil is deficient of something.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:32):**  But most soil is not.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:36):**  So now that leaves us with the three major nutrients.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:40):**  And it turns out that we have a lot of myths about these nutrients and fertilizer.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:47):**  So one of the first ones is that this idea that we have to feed plants.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:52):**  Somehow it's like us eating we have to you know every month or so we have to feed these  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:57):**  plants.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:32:59):**  And that's really complete nonsense.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:04):**  The point of adding fertilizer to your garden and whether this is synthetic fertilizer or  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:11):**  it's compost or manure it doesn't really matter.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:14):**  All of those things are adding nutrients to the garden.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:17):**  The reason we add nutrients to the garden is to replace the nutrients that are missing  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:22):**  in the soil.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:25):**  Has nothing to do with feeding plants.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:27):**  We're actually feeding the soil.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:30):**  But we want to add the nutrients that are missing.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:35):**  One of the ways I try to get people to understand this if you go to Google and you Google tomato  
**[0:33:41-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:41):**  fertilizer and set it to images so you see all the pictures of all the fertilizer products.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:49):**  Look at them all.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:50):**  They all have different formulations.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:53):**  You can easily find a dozen different fertilizers.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:56):**  They're all tomato fertilizer.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:33:58):**  They're all perfect for tomatoes and they all have different MPK numbers.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:01):**  So how can that be?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:04):**  If there was such a thing as a tomato fertilizer they would all have the same number because  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:09):**  the scientists would have figured that out and said well okay tomatoes need you know  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:13):**  a 10 5 3 and that's perfect for tomatoes.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:19):**  That's not what we have.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:20):**  We have all kinds of different numbers.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:24):**  And the reason is that it has nothing to do with the plant.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:28):**  It has nothing to do with tomatoes.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:31):**  So if we have you and I both try to grow tomatoes and my soil is deficient of potassium I need  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:39):**  to add potassium.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:41):**  If your soil is deficient of phosphorus you have to add phosphorus.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:45):**  So the fertilizer you and I need for the same tomatoes is completely different because it's  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:51):**  dependent on the soil not on the plants.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:34:57):**  And once you understand that you realize that the whole business of getting nutrients into  
**[0:35:02-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:02):**  the soil is all about figuring out what you're missing and then add those missing components.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:10):**  So now the obvious question is well how do you know what's missing?  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:15):**  And there's only one way and that's to do a soil test.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:18):**  Soil test would tell you if you're deficient.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:20):**  Well that's sorry that's not entirely correct.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:25):**  My approach is a different approach.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:27):**  What I do is I just plant lots of different things and if they grow I know I'm not deficient.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:35):**  If I had a nutrient deficiency and I can grow 50 different kinds of plants and they're all  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:40):**  doing quite well I don't have a soil deficiency.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:44):**  If I did they wouldn't be growing well.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:47):**  So if I'm growing things and they're not doing well then I want to go get a soil test because  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:51):**  there's something wrong in my soil.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:55):**  It could be too low.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:56):**  It could also be too high.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:35:59):**  So one of the things that people are finding now is that a lot of gardeners understand  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:04):**  and they need to put lots of organics into the soil and they're going overboard and they're  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:07):**  putting in huge amounts of organics and they're actually poisoning the plants because now  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:12):**  they have too many nutrients.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:15):**  So that can be a problem in that kind of a situation.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:20):**  So grow plants.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:22):**  If they're not growing get a soil test and find out whether you're low or high on something.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:29):**  If the plants are growing well then guess what you don't need to fertilize because the  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:32):**  soil already has what it needs.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:36):**  Well so let's come back around to this idea of plants as indicators and as a tool that  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:42):**  you can use to diagnose problems in your soil and before we get to that let's come back  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:46):**  to kind of the key to all of the functions of the soil ecosystem which is the life inside  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:53):**  of the soil.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:54):**  So we've talked about structure, we've talked about nutrients, pH and those types of things  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:36:58):**  but how do we foster healthy life within the soil ecosystem?  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:03):**  So let's start back with the structure.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:06):**  So soil has this three dimensional type of structure called aggregation and what I recommend  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:13):**  gardeners do is go for a walk in the woods someplace in a forest that has been there  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:19):**  for a hundred years and nobody's touched it and touch that soil and see what it looks  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:26):**  like.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:27):**  In most cases it will be black, it will be very crumbly, you'll be able to dig it with  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:31):**  your hands without a shovel.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:34):**  That soil has really good aggregation and aggregation is sort of a clumping together  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:43):**  of all the bits and pieces of soil, the sand, silt and clay and organic matter and the microbes  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:49):**  and the fungi and plant roots, it all kind of clumps together into these larger pieces  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:55):**  we call aggregates.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:37:58):**  And healthy soil has very good aggregation and the real value of these aggregates is  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:07):**  that they're big and they allow lots of water and air between them.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:13):**  So aggregation reduces compaction and allows lots of air to get into the soil and plants  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:21):**  love that.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:22):**  All the roots go between the aggregates because the spaces are big enough for roots to grow  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:26):**  through.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:28):**  How do you get aggregation?  
**[0:38:30-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:30):**  Well you get aggregation by having a healthy micro population.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:37):**  Lots of bacteria and algae and fungi and there's hundreds of different things in your soil  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:44):**  and as a group I just call those microbes.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:48):**  So healthy soil is all about keeping microbes happy and microbes for the most part eat organic  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:56):**  matter.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:38:57):**  So we want to keep giving them organic matter which they decompose and as they decompose  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:04):**  that organic matter it releases nutrients and these microbes eat the nutrients and they  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:09):**  leave some for the plants.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:13):**  So the more organic matter you have in there the more microbes you get and it's sort of  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:17):**  a snowball effect.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:19):**  The microbes create more aggregates that adds more air, you get a healthier soil and it  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:24):**  slowly builds up the structure of that soil.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:29):**  So really those microbes, the purpose of those microbes is to build good soil, is to make  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:36):**  those aggregates and those aggregates slowly fall apart over time so you have to keep the  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:42):**  microbes there.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:43):**  It's not a one step process, it's a continual process and so we want to keep adding a small  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:51):**  amount of organic matter to the soil over a long period of time and slowly build up  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:56):**  our aggregation.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:39:57):**  Alright, so from there let's talk about some of the common soil issues and solutions that  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:03):**  you mentioned in the second portion of this book.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:05):**  Now that we have a pretty well-rounded understanding of the different components and aspects of  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:10):**  soil, some of the terminology, obviously your book goes into way more detail than we can  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:15):**  cover here.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:16):**  Let's talk about some of the common things like I said that people might find in their  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:20):**  garden or on their farms and talk about what we can do about them.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:24):**  Let's start with cases of when you don't need to fertilize because this seems to be sort  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:32):**  of a prevailing knowledge that if anything isn't growing well it's for a lack of fertilizer.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:37):**  What would you say to that?  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:39):**  It could be lots of things.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:41):**  It could be nutrients, it could be fertilizer, it could be watering issues, not enough water,  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:48):**  too little water.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:50):**  It can be a drainage issue.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:52):**  So if the water gets into the soil and just sits there that means not enough oxygen is  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:58):**  getting in.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:40:59):**  So drainage is important.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:03):**  It can be the type of soil you actually have.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:09):**  So if it's really sandy soil you have much lower nutrients so that can be an issue.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:17):**  It can also be a function of oxygen so compaction is a big problem.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:23):**  If you're trying to grow things in compacted soil they just won't grow well and you can  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:26):**  fertilize them all you want.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:28):**  It's not really going to help the problem because the problem is a lack of oxygen which  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:35):**  is due because of compaction.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:39):**  So what you have to now do is to go through and try and analyze your soil and decide which  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:46):**  of these possible problems you have.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:49):**  Do you have a drainage issue, compaction issue, nutrient issue?  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:55):**  What is the problem here?  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:41:57):**  The other issue is not enough organic matter.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:02):**  So our traditional way of farming we use a lot of plowing so we're constantly digging  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:09):**  up that soil and we're removing crops.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:12):**  And so the amount of organic material in that soil is dropping.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:19):**  And that's the real problem with our agricultural system right now is that we are using up the  
**[0:42:24-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:24):**  organic matter that's been built up for hundreds and thousands of years and we're slowly decreasing  
**[0:42:31-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:31):**  that.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:33):**  So now someone comes along and builds a house there and someone moves in and has a garden  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:37):**  on that farmland.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:39):**  They start out with poor soil.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:43):**  So the amount of organic matter in many soils is probably too low.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:49):**  Now if you live in a house that's a hundred years old and you've had gardeners living  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:53):**  in that house for a hundred years you probably have excellent soil because they brought it  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:42:58):**  back to life.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:00):**  But if it's newer soil and a newer subdivision it can be very low in organic matter.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:07):**  So a big problem you have is that you're not going to be able to take care of your microbes  
**[0:43:13-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:13):**  because there isn't enough organic matter in the soil.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:16):**  That's the food for microbes.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:18):**  At the same time it may be too compacted and microbes need air just like us and so compacted  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:25):**  soil has less microbes.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:27):**  So the trick is to go through and identify which of these problems you have.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:32):**  Now there are some other areas of you know if you're on sloped land you have areas where  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:37):**  the water settles and stays wet and others that stay dry.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:41):**  So the topography of your soil can also be important.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:45):**  And what the book does it sort of walks you through each of these possible problems that  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:51):**  you might have and shows you how to identify if in fact you have one of these problems.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:43:58):**  Because everybody's going to have a different set of problems.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:02):**  And then once you have an understanding of where you are, what you have today and what  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:07):**  your problems are, then you have a chance of correcting those problems.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:12):**  Sure.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:13):**  Now so you mentioned kind of tilling as this problem of industrial agriculture and some  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:19):**  people's gardening practices.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:21):**  Let's talk a little bit about the effects on the soil that tilling has, not just getting  
**[0:44:26-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:26):**  rid of organic matter but the kind of full spectrum of what happens to soil composition  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:32):**  and life when it gets exposed and tossed up into the air like that.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:37):**  Yeah, so there's a number of issues with tilling.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:41):**  One is of course you have more loss of the surface soil through the winds and so on because  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:48):**  you've loosened the top up and it gets blown away.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:52):**  And so that's a big problem on large farms, not so much in a backyard because the wind  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:44:58):**  doesn't move it around so much.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:02):**  The big problem is that tilling adds more oxygen to the soil immediately which means  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:10):**  the decomposition process speeds up.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:13):**  So right after tilling you've got lots of air in that soil.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:17):**  The microbes get all excited and start growing.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:21):**  They start decomposing the organic matter faster than usual and that's why you have  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:28):**  this drop in organic matter.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:31):**  That's particularly true with bacteria.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:34):**  Tilling also damages the fungal life that's in the soil.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:39):**  So fungi live in soil by making long filaments and they're yards long and the tilling chops  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:45):**  all those up.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:47):**  So in effect it kills off a lot of the fungi life that's in the soil.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:53):**  Bacteria are small enough that they're not really bothered by that.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:45:57):**  So what you have is a decrease in organic matter, a decrease in fungi.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:02):**  You've completely changed the microbe community that lives there because you have growth on  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:09):**  the bacterial side but a decrease in fungi so you've changed the ratio of all of those  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:14):**  things.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:15):**  You've completely taken this soil system that you have and completely changed the populations  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:22):**  in it and so you end up with a different kind of growth and different set of microbes in  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:29):**  that soil.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:31):**  Do you want to talk a little bit about the hard pan effect too that can sometimes come  
**[0:46:35-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:35):**  from repeated tilling?  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:38):**  So on a farmed area, tilling only goes down so far and particularly things like a rotator  
**[0:46:46-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:46):**  type tilling, it only goes down let's say eight inches and you do that repeatedly but  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:54):**  at the eight inch mark you're actually compacting soil.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:46:59):**  So the top part looks loose but at the bottom of that tiller you're actually pressing the  
**[0:47:04-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:04):**  soil down and creating a compacted layer which is your hard pan.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:11):**  And so after many years you get this layer that roots have trouble penetrating.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:15):**  Again what you've done is you've compacted the soil, it's just a little lower than if  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:20):**  you just walk on the soil.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:22):**  Yeah, it's kind of like a little superficial facade on the top of the earth but the effects  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:28):**  are worse down below.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:29):**  Are there any situations in which you would recommend tilling?  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:33):**  Are there any long term benefits?  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:36):**  Well it depends on sort of who it is.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:39):**  There are reasons why farmers till and there's certain crops that just don't do well without  
**[0:47:46-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:46):**  tilling.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:48):**  Around here we're a zone five so it's fairly cool and if farmers don't till the soil doesn't  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:47:55):**  dry out fast enough in spring for them to get a crop because of our short growing season.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:01):**  So certain crops just won't grow well without tilling.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:07):**  In warmer climates that's less of an issue.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:10):**  As a backyard gardener or a small farmer the best thing to do is to never till.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:19):**  I don't see a problem with tilling the first time when you're preparing a bed for the first  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:24):**  time and you're starting out with a pretty crappy soil and it's compacted and everything  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:30):**  and you want to incorporate a bunch of organic matter and you till the whole thing in, that's  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:34):**  fine.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:35):**  But once your garden is prepared the trick is not to walk on the planting beds, walk  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:41):**  on permanent paths and then don't till again.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:46):**  The rule of thumb is disturb that soil as little as possible and that will build better  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:53):**  aggregation.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:48:55):**  So I think on a small garden type lot there's never a reason to till.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:00):**  One of the other things that I've heard from tilling too is that though it doesn't seem  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:03):**  like it, especially in the beginning once you've gotten rid of all of the weeds or anything  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:08):**  else you didn't want on the surface there, it actually wakes up dormant weed seeds or  
**[0:49:13-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:13):**  any other plants that you didn't want that had just been lying just below the top of  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:20):**  the soil and were inactive until you exposed them to oxygen and light and there can often  
**[0:49:25-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:25):**  be a bigger flush of weeds than the issue you were fighting to begin with.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:32):**  Yeah, so tilling gets rid of the weeds you see but right under the soil is something  
**[0:49:38-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:38):**  called the seed bank and there's millions and millions of seeds just waiting to get  
**[0:49:44-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:44):**  some light.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:46):**  So these seeds might be down half an inch or so and it's too dark and they won't germinate  
**[0:49:51-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:51):**  until they get more light and tilling brings them to the surface and they germinate.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:49:56):**  So the process of tilling actually increases the amount of weeds you have and so then you  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:01):**  come along and you till again.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:05):**  So you're much better off using some sort of mulch to keep the weeds from drying.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:10):**  Well that's perfect because that's exactly what I was about to ask about.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:13):**  So mulching is very well known especially in permaculture circles and ecological gardening  
**[0:50:19-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:19):**  circles.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:20):**  There's a lot of different ways to do it and each one kind of has different benefits and  
**[0:50:24-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:24):**  drawbacks.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:25):**  Do you want to kind of talk on mulch for a second?  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:28):**  Sure.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:29):**  I'm a big believer in mulch.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:31):**  In a sort of a garden setting I like using wood chips as my mulch.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:38):**  It lasts a fairly long period of time.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:40):**  In our climate it's about three years before I have to replace it.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:45):**  So that works well.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:47):**  It's relatively inexpensive if you can get it from arborists and it just holds the moisture  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:52):**  in that soil really well and there's virtually no weeds that come through it.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:50:57):**  I mean there's some perennial weeds that have long runners and so on.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:01):**  They're an issue but germination from seed is almost zero under a good layer of wood  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:08):**  chip mulch.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:09):**  Now there is a myth around that says that putting wood chips on a soil robs the soil  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:15):**  of nitrogen which harms the plants.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:20):**  And that has a bit of truth to it.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:23):**  So wood is very high in carbon, very low in nitrogen.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:28):**  So for microbes to decompose it they have to get nitrogen from somewhere and they get  
**[0:51:34-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:34):**  it from the soil.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:36):**  But they're getting it from the top millimeter or two of soil.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:39):**  They're not getting it where the plant roots are.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:42):**  So the nitrogen levels at plant root don't change.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:47):**  The nitrogen levels right at the top of the soil will go down as that wood decomposes.  
**[0:51:53-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:51:53):**  So it's sort of true but the net result is that it has no effect on your plant growth.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:01):**  So now we go over to the vegetable garden and I could use wood chips there too.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:07):**  The problem in a vegetable garden is you tend to churn the soil a little more.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:12):**  You know you're moving it to plant seeds or you're moving it to plant seedlings.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:18):**  Then you're harvesting, you're weeding it a little more.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:22):**  Every time you're in there you're kind of moving soil around and that process takes  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:27):**  those wood chips and starts digging them into the soil.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:31):**  Even if you try not to do that some of them would still go in.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:35):**  And once you take wood chips and bury them then they will take nitrogen from around the  
**[0:52:40-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:40):**  wood chips.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:42):**  So if that wood chip ends up next to roots then there is a bit less nitrogen for your  
**[0:52:48-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:48):**  plants.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:49):**  Now I don't know how significant that is.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:51):**  You'd have to I think put up quite a bit of wood chips in there.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:54):**  But for that reason wood chips is probably not your best choice for a vegetable garden.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:52:59):**  And in a vegetable garden I much prefer using straw.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:04):**  It fluffs up nice, it keeps the weeds down.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:09):**  Because they're longer pieces they tend not to get buried in the soil so much.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:15):**  They are high in carbon so it's still a bit of an issue but they decompose a little easier.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:20):**  So I find something like straw or hay works much better in a vegetable garden than wood  
**[0:53:27-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:27):**  chips.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:29):**  But I wouldn't do either one without mulch.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:33):**  It cuts down the amount of watering drastically.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:37):**  And these days in a lot of areas water is becoming more and more precious all the time.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:42):**  And it's just less work if you don't have to water these things.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:45):**  So I'm a big believer in mulch.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:48):**  The other thing people don't realize is that plant roots don't like to be warm.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:52):**  They actually like nice cool soil.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:53:55):**  And so having a mulch on there keeps the soil cooler, the plant roots are happier, keeps  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:01):**  the weeds out, it's a lot less work.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:05):**  I think it's just a perfect solution.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:07):**  Well it's just like nothing in nature grows without that.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:11):**  In any healthy ecosystem you won't see a bunch of bare soil and then a handful of very delicate  
**[0:54:18-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:18):**  crops much like most of the ones that we choose to eat in a vegetable garden.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:22):**  They wouldn't grow like that under any other circumstance.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:25):**  An area like that doesn't last very long.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:29):**  For weeks then it's covered with weeds again.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:32):**  Nature says something has to grow there.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:34):**  Exactly, yeah.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:35):**  It's going to go through its successive models to try and remediate the soil with whatever  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:40):**  tools it has.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:41):**  So alright let's talk, we covered tilling and mulching, let's talk about chemical problems.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:48):**  This is one that I didn't know very much about.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:51):**  It's not a problem that I had come up with in most of the soils that I've worked with  
**[0:54:55-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:55):**  in the past.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:56):**  Give us a little overview on chemical problems in the soil.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:54:59):**  Oh there's many of them.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:02):**  It's a broad topic so let's go over it kind of briefly and definitely people who are interested  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:06):**  or know specific issues about chemical problems in their own soil can look for it in the book.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:12):**  So this is another area that a gardener sort of needs to work through to see if any of  
**[0:55:18-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:18):**  these apply to them.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:20):**  So there are some soils that have very high salt concentrations and by salt here I'm talking  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:26):**  about sodium chloride.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:28):**  So soil that's near the ocean generally has high sodium levels.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:35):**  In inland seas that were salty at one point so this can be a geological thing so that  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:42):**  you know a million years ago you had a salt water ocean where your garden is now and so  
**[0:55:47-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:47):**  you end up with sodium salts in your garden.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:53):**  Sodium is very toxic to plants and that's the main issue with sodium so you have to  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:55:58):**  know if that's a problem.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:01):**  If you have to irrigate with salty water then you have some other special issues but that  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:09):**  doesn't apply to most people.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:13):**  You can have other types of salts in your soil so you can have very high levels of lime  
**[0:56:19-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:19):**  in your soil, a lot of carbonates can be a problem in your soil.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:27):**  Carbonates come a lot from limestone so if you're in an area that's made up of limestone  
**[0:56:32-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:32):**  then you may have high carbonate levels so that can be an issue.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:37):**  So you have to determine if any of those apply.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:40):**  Then we go back to our nutrients.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:43):**  You can certainly have high nutrient levels.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:47):**  Phosphorus is becoming more of a concern in a lot of soils so for many years we followed  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:56:55):**  fertilizer manufacturers advice and we used 10-10-10 and we spread that in our gardens  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:00):**  year after year after year and then people realized that you know what in North America  
**[0:57:07-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:07):**  at least most soil in North America has lots of phosphorus already we don't have to add  
**[0:57:13-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:13):**  any and so many manufacturers are now taking it out of fertilizer but a lot of the damage  
**[0:57:21-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:21):**  has been done.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:24):**  And the thing with phosphorus is that it doesn't move through the soil very quickly.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:29):**  It moves a few millimeters a year through soil so once you have this problem it's there  
**[0:57:34-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:34):**  for a long time and so high phosphorus levels can be a problem and it will keep plants from  
**[0:57:41-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:41):**  growing it can be in effect toxic to plants.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:47):**  So you want to go through sort of a series of different things to look at and see if  
**[0:57:51-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:51):**  any of those apply to your soil and then each one of those have different types of remediation  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:57:58):**  that you can do.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:03):**  Again the good news is that for most gardeners those are not an issue but it's something  
**[0:58:08-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:08):**  that you really should be aware of in case that is your problem.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:13):**  So as we kind of graduate through these different things that people can find as potential issues  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:18):**  and go through some solutions here we talked as well about you know the life in the soil  
**[0:58:24-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:24):**  and it's kind of coming in and out of fashion to either do like organic teas compost teas  
**[0:58:31-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:31):**  or at the moment it's very popular to put in what they call essential microbes EMs or  
**[0:58:37-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:37):**  other inoculants into the soil to sort of boost or give a give a little surge of life  
**[0:58:43-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:43):**  in there.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:45):**  What do you think about the efficacy of these and and if they're necessary in many cases?  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:51):**  So I guess let's start with a warning to gardeners.  
**[0:58:54-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:58:54):**  I think the market's going to get flooded with containers containing microbes.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:01):**  So they are used in agriculture and they do work in certain situations but all kinds of  
**[0:59:10-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:10):**  companies are now trying to figure out which of these microbes we're going to package up  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:15):**  and you've probably seen mycorrhizal fungi for sale.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:19):**  There are all kinds of other mixtures with bacteria plus fungi in them.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:25):**  Here's the big problem with them.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:27):**  We know that all of these microbes can be good for soil.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:31):**  There's there's no doubt about that.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:33):**  Mycorrhizal fungi are important for natural plant life.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:38):**  Nobody questions that.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:41):**  The question is can I take a jar of these things and put it on my soil and make any  
**[0:59:46-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:46):**  difference?  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:47):**  And here's the big problem you have.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:51):**  If your soil is deficient in other ways so it doesn't have enough oxygen and it doesn't  
**[0:59:56-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=0:59:56):**  have enough organic matter, the microbes aren't there because they don't want to be there.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:02):**  They can't live there.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:05):**  Microbes reproduce extremely quickly and they live in any place that is suitable for them.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:15):**  Adding a few more microbes to that situation isn't going to help them because they don't  
**[1:00:21-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:21):**  want to live there.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:22):**  They don't have the right conditions for them to live there.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:26):**  If the conditions were right, they would already be there.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:30):**  So adding microbes to soil really makes no sense at all unless you're trying to deal  
**[1:00:37-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:37):**  with a very specific problem and those are generally disease problems.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:43):**  So you're putting in a microbe to fight the disease.  
**[1:00:47-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:47):**  And in agriculture they can do that because they'll do all the studies and the preliminary  
**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:53):**  work to make sure they're adding the right microbes.  
**[1:00:55-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:55):**  But for a general gardener, none of these things are working.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:00:59):**  It's kind of like the thing with the probiotics that people consume, right?  
**[1:01:06-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:06):**  I've heard about so many people being on either pills or solutions or special probiotic drinks,  
**[1:01:12-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:12):**  but then their diet is still a mess and those beneficial bacteria that are in those drinks  
**[1:01:18-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:18):**  don't have anything to eat or consume or to keep them alive once they're actually in your  
**[1:01:22-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:22):**  body.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:24):**  It's a very similar situation, right?  
**[1:01:30-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:30):**  And the other thing, people don't understand how many microbes you have.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:33):**  So if you take a pinch of soil, so this is the weight of a paperclip, which is about  
**[1:01:39-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:39):**  a gram of soil.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:41):**  In good soil, you can easily have a billion bacterias in that soil.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:48):**  When you go to the store and buy them, you don't get that many in a jar.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:53):**  Under soil has huge, huge numbers of microbes already.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:01:58):**  Even poor soil has large, large numbers of microbes.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:03):**  And the numbers are so big that we can't even get our head around them.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:09):**  Adding a few more isn't going to make any difference whatsoever.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:12):**  What are some of the things that you can do to make sure that the microbes have the living  
**[1:02:16-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:16):**  conditions that they need to thrive on their own without these extra inoculants?  
**[1:02:22-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:22):**  So microbes need a couple of things.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:25):**  They need the air, they need the water, and they need food.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:31):**  So it's really hard for us to get air in the soil.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:33):**  There's nothing we can really do to do that except to make the soil better.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:36):**  And when we do that, the air comes naturally.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:40):**  Water – it's good that soil does not dry out because when soil dries out, a lot of  
**[1:02:45-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:45):**  these microbes either die off or have to go into hibernation.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:50):**  So keeping soil regularly moist is better for microbe growth.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:55):**  So that leaves food.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:02:57):**  And so the real secret is to feed them.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:01):**  And the best food for microbes is some sort of organic matter.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:06):**  And we want to add organic matter that has what I like to call bulk, so something that  
**[1:03:13-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:13):**  you can actually see.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:15):**  So let's compare two things here.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:17):**  Let's compare a fish head with a fish extract fertilizer.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:23):**  They're both made from fish.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:25):**  They both have nutrients for plants.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:29):**  But the extracted material is a liquid, and it doesn't have any long-term feeding effect  
**[1:03:36-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:36):**  for microbes.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:37):**  If I take the fish head and bury it, it's going to take the next five years to decompose  
**[1:03:44-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:44):**  completely.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:45):**  So over a five-year period, it's slowly feeding my microbes.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:48):**  It's slowly decomposing.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:51):**  And in the process, it adds carbon to the soil.  
**[1:03:54-1:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:54):**  So it's adding humus to that soil.  
**[1:03:57-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:57):**  So we want something bulky.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:03:59):**  So compost, manure, plant residue, rice hulls, any kind of byproduct from plant industry  
**[1:04:10-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:10):**  is generally a good thing to get.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:14):**  Something organic, something that has bulk, and we want to continually add some to the  
**[1:04:19-1:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:19):**  soil, provided we don't add too much.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:22):**  So a couple inches a year, put on the surface.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:26):**  Nature will take it into the soil, and that's all you really need.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:31):**  And that's the food for the microbes.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:32):**  If you keep doing that, the micropopulations will increase.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:39):**  So let me see if I get this right, because though there is a lot of detail and specifics  
**[1:04:43-1:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:43):**  and hard science in each specific topic that we've covered in this, there also seem to  
**[1:04:50-1:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:50):**  be some broad strokes that anybody, even if they don't have any experience in this, can  
**[1:04:56-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:04:56):**  use to first diagnose or find the problems that they're having in their soil and some  
**[1:05:02-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:02):**  general guidelines that tend to work for most situations.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:07):**  If I understand it right, the first thing you got to do is do some tests.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:11):**  And most of the time it doesn't come to the point where you need to do laboratory tests  
**[1:05:16-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:16):**  unless you're maybe in an agro business and you have some very specific needs or planting  
**[1:05:22-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:22):**  regimen.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:23):**  But there's some simple things that you can do, both feeling, using the jar test and others  
**[1:05:29-1:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:29):**  that we mentioned, to kind of diagnose what point your soil is at before you start adding  
**[1:05:34-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:34):**  any kind of amendments, adding nutrients or anything.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:37):**  Because until you know what deficiencies are or what the texture, the composition is, you  
**[1:05:44-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:44):**  don't really know what you're doing.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:46):**  And then from there, some of the broad strokes is making sure that there's enough organic  
**[1:05:51-1:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:05:51):**  material in the soil and that you're not overfeeding it or causing toxic levels of any nutrients  
**[1:06:02-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:02):**  just from not knowing.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:03):**  Am I kind of on base here?  
**[1:06:04-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:04):**  Are there some other things that you would suggest that people can kind of do without  
**[1:06:08-1:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:08):**  having to worry about it or needing to know too many specifics about their soil?  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:13):**  Well, you're on the right track.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:18):**  You go through that testing process.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:20):**  You identify what issues you might have with your soil.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:25):**  And then I think the third step is to decide which of those issues is a priority.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:33):**  Which one should you tackle first?  
**[1:06:35-1:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:35):**  Most people can't do them all at one time.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:38):**  So you sort of end up with this list of things.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:41):**  I have a certain level of compaction and I know how much compaction I have.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:46):**  I have these other issues.  
**[1:06:47-1:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:47):**  Now which of these are my priorities?  
**[1:06:50-1:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:50):**  Which one should I tackle first?  
**[1:06:53-1:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:53):**  There's also an issue that some of these things can be fixed quickly and other things can't  
**[1:06:59-1:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:06:59):**  be fixed quickly.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:01):**  So if my soil has no potassium, that's really easy.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:06):**  I can just put on potassium fertilizer and I've solved that.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:08):**  That's quick.  
**[1:07:10-1:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:10):**  If my organic levels are low, that's not a quick fix.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:14):**  That's a long term fix.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:16):**  So you want to look at all these issues and decide, okay, which ones can I reasonably  
**[1:07:21-1:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:21):**  do today and which ones should be my priority?  
**[1:07:25-1:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:25):**  And then which ones am I going to leave for tomorrow and the year after and the year after?  
**[1:07:31-1:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:31):**  So that kind of leads us into that third portion of the book in how to develop a personalized  
**[1:07:38-1:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:38):**  plan on your specific soil.  
**[1:07:40-1:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:40):**  And you've got great resources there in the back including worksheets that people can  
**[1:07:44-1:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:44):**  fill out and kind of use as guides along the process.  
**[1:07:47-1:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:47):**  Can you kind of explain the general protocol for going through those steps?  
**[1:07:54-1:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:54):**  So it's very similar to what you've described there.  
**[1:07:57-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:07:57):**  So step one is to go through the various tasks and the charts actually get you to apply a  
**[1:08:06-1:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:06):**  number to it.  
**[1:08:07-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:07):**  And it's a simple numbering system, one to three.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:12):**  But we apply a number.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:14):**  Is this okay but not great?  
**[1:08:17-1:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:17):**  Or is it really good or is it really bad?  
**[1:08:21-1:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:21):**  And we apply a number to it.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:22):**  And we go through all of the various tasks and you kind of get that as a report card.  
**[1:08:27-1:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:27):**  And then you can see exactly what are the worst issues in your soil.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:32):**  And then the second part of that is for you to go through and figure out what steps you  
**[1:08:37-1:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:37):**  want to take.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:40):**  And that has a lot to do with your time, your cost, you know, how much can you afford to  
**[1:08:46-1:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:46):**  do at one time financially.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:49):**  And then you make a list of your priorities for this year.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:54):**  And then you go through and do that.  
**[1:08:56-1:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:08:56):**  And then next year you sort of go through the whole process again.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:00):**  You retest some of those things in your soil.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:03):**  Now you don't have to retest everything because you'll know some things are okay.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:06):**  But you retest some of them.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:08):**  You measure the progress you've made since last year.  
**[1:09:12-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:12):**  And then you reevaluate all of the things you can do and come up with a new work list  
**[1:09:17-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:17):**  for this, for the current year.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:21):**  And you do that year after year and that way you can see how your soil is slowly improving.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:27):**  It really forces you to prioritize the most important things first and work on those.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:34):**  Yeah, that's what I really like about this system is that, you know, it's highly customizable.  
**[1:09:39-1:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:39):**  It's obviously going to give you a determined result based on your specific situation.  
**[1:09:43-1:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:43):**  But it breaks down the steps, like you said, into priorities, into long-term, short-term  
**[1:09:49-1:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:49):**  goals so that it takes kind of the weight off of what it means to improve soil.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:09:56):**  Because it's such a kind of amalgas, large topic and can be really daunting if you look  
**[1:10:00-1:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:00):**  at it as this major task, especially when certain aspects take a really long time to  
**[1:10:06-1:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:06):**  reform.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:07):**  And by breaking it down into those smaller steps, it kind of makes it a manageable thing,  
**[1:10:11-1:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:11):**  especially when you take it into context of like your time and your financial investments  
**[1:10:15-1:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:15):**  and what you can put into it and what you can do in the short term.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:19):**  Right.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:20):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:21):**  And everyone's situation is going to be a little different.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:22):**  You know, are you growing vegetables or do you have an ornamental garden bed you're working  
**[1:10:27-1:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:27):**  with?  
**[1:10:28-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:28):**  So your priorities will be different for those sort of scenarios.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:31):**  You know, what are your priorities as far as staying in the property?  
**[1:10:37-1:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:37):**  How long are you going to have this soil?  
**[1:10:39-1:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:39):**  Do you plan to live there for three years and then move or is this a long-term project?  
**[1:10:44-1:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:44):**  You can take all of those things into account and then come up with this and that works  
**[1:10:49-1:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:49):**  for you.  
**[1:10:50-1:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:50):**  I love it.  
**[1:10:51-1:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:51):**  So look, for those of you listening, the book is Soil Science for Gardeners.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:10:56):**  Robert, before you go, can you tell us about the other books that you have available and  
**[1:11:00-1:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:00):**  what other resources you have online because you have so many.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:04):**  All right.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:05):**  So let's, we'll go through the books first.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:07):**  By the way, they're all available on Amazon and they're available in other sources too,  
**[1:11:12-1:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:12):**  but they're definitely available on Amazon.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:14):**  I don't sell them direct off my various websites and so on.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:20):**  So that's the best place to get them.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:23):**  The new one is Soil Science for Gardeners.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:26):**  It's not quite available yet.  
**[1:11:28-1:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:28):**  I'm not quite sure when this podcast will air, but it should be shipping.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:34):**  You can order it from Amazon today and it should be shipping around 1st to the 15th  
**[1:11:40-1:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:40):**  of March.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:41):**  So we're really close to the release date now.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:43):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:44):**  I mean, for those, I mean, who have been listening too, I would recommend that you get the book  
**[1:11:48-1:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:48):**  through New Society Publishers if you want to make sure your money is going to a good  
**[1:11:52-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:52):**  source and an ethical distributor as well.  
**[1:11:56-1:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:11:56):**  My other books, I have two books called Garden Myths, which is the subject that I write a  
**[1:12:03-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:03):**  lot about.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:04):**  So I have a blog called GardenMyths.com and I have two books, Garden Myths book one and  
**[1:12:11-1:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:11):**  book two.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:12):**  They're both completely different.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:15):**  They both cover about 120 different myths covering a full range of different topics  
**[1:12:21-1:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:21):**  and each book's a little different.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:23):**  The topics are on the cover.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:27):**  Those are self-published, so they're available from Amazon, but not available from New Society.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:34):**  And then my first book, which we mentioned is Building Natural Ponds.  
**[1:12:40-1:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:40):**  And about 14 years ago, I wanted to build a pond that didn't use pumps and filters and  
**[1:12:47-1:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:47):**  chemicals and so on.  
**[1:12:48-1:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:48):**  I just wanted a real natural pond.  
**[1:12:52-1:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:52):**  Everybody told me you couldn't do it.  
**[1:12:53-1:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:12:53):**  So I went ahead and did it anyways and waited for four or five years and it worked perfectly.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:01):**  And so I started writing about it and then New Society Publishers came along and asked  
**[1:13:06-1:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:06):**  me to write a book about it.  
**[1:13:08-1:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:08):**  It works beautifully.  
**[1:13:10-1:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:10):**  It's basically using plants and a proper pond design to do all of your cleaning.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:16):**  I have no algae problems.  
**[1:13:18-1:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:18):**  I have crystal clear water and I do nothing to the pond every year except once a year  
**[1:13:23-1:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:23):**  I top it up because we just don't get enough rain here.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:28):**  I don't clean it out.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:29):**  I haven't scooped the bottom out in a long time.  
**[1:13:33-1:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:33):**  It's full of frogs and dragonflies and all kinds of animals come to drink there.  
**[1:13:41-1:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:41):**  It works really well.  
**[1:13:43-1:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:43):**  If you want to get in touch with me, search Garden Fundamentals.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:49):**  I have a YouTube channel, a Facebook group that you can join and we have gardeners from  
**[1:13:54-1:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:54):**  all over the place joining that.  
**[1:13:56-1:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:56):**  And I have a blog.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:13:58):**  So GardenFundamentals.com, Fundamentals on YouTube and also Facebook group.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:04):**  I love these all great resources.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:06):**  I highly recommend.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:07):**  I checked out that blog recently and yeah there's some great stuff on there.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:11):**  I think I just shared a post about the myth about air purifying plants in the home.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:17):**  That was a really good one because that was one that I believed for a long time before  
**[1:14:20-1:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:20):**  looking further into it.  
**[1:14:22-1:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:22):**  I love that there's people out there kind of digging in deeper because you know we just  
**[1:14:26-1:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:26):**  don't have the time to dispel all the myths that circulate on the internet but this is  
**[1:14:30-1:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:30):**  a really good resource to get to the bottom a lot of those things.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:34):**  The interesting thing is that I believe a lot of those myths too when I start looking  
**[1:14:38-1:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:38):**  into them.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:40):**  And you know it'd just be something that comes in my head and says well you know we all talk  
**[1:14:45-1:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:45):**  about plants purifying homes how efficient are they?  
**[1:14:49-1:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:49):**  And I see people advertising different plants so then I just start researching it and find  
**[1:14:54-1:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:54):**  out the truth.  
**[1:14:56-1:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:14:56):**  But many of the myths I debunk I believe them too when I start.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:01):**  Yeah that's the thing right.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:02):**  They all seem true until you know differently.  
**[1:15:06-1:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:06):**  Well hey look Robert thank you so much for taking the time to share your knowledge with  
**[1:15:10-1:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:10):**  us again.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:11):**  I'm really excited to continue on with this book and kind of apply it as I get a piece  
**[1:15:16-1:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:16):**  of land that can start to apply some of the tests and the different kind of techniques  
**[1:15:22-1:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:22):**  to improve the soil.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:23):**  Like you said it's one of these kind of long term sometimes lifetime journeys that you  
**[1:15:27-1:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:27):**  go through but the rewards are really immense.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/robert-pavlis-soil/#t=1:15:30):**  So again thank you for taking the time and I look forward to catching up with you again

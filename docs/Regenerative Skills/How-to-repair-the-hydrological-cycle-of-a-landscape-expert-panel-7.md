**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:01:09):**  Since landscape hydrology and its proper function is often overlooked in its importance in regulating

**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:01:48):**  Zach, where are you at these days?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:01:51):**  I am out in Oregon right now.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:01:53):**  It's the fifth driest year on record and it's looking a little scary if we don't get some  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:00):**  rain here, but the project we're working on has plenty of water, nice hydrated landscape.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:07):**  So it's a good reminder of why we're doing this.

**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:14):**  I am in beautiful Big Timber, Montana, and yesterday we had like a day and a night of  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:21):**  rainfall, so we're feeling pretty good today.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:24):**  It's beautiful out there.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:26):**  Well, that's fortunate.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:28):**  And Mark, why don't you give them an update for others who are just tuning in?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:31):**  I'm in southwest Wisconsin at New Forest Farm and we have had the longest, hottest, driest  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:40):**  June on record in the earlier part of the month until like two days ago, actually.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:47):**  We had, I think it was nine or 10 days over 90 degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:52):**  We hadn't had any rain since last fall and everything was just starting to look crispy.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:02:57):**  Probably 25, 30% of the corn crop is going to have reduced yields.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:03):**  It's all crispy on the edges and stuff like that.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:05):**  So then just the other night we had a three inch rainfall, huge humongous winds, tornadoes  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:10):**  and all that, and flash floods for people without unmanaged water.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:17):**  So the rural crop farmers are on an emergency, must have rain specifically on time, but like  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:25):**  Zach had said, with all the water we stored in the soil and what we've got stored in ponds,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:30):**  we'll be all right.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:31):**  Nice.

**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:39):**  So as the effects of climate change have an increasing impact, one of the most severe  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:45):**  is the erratic and unpredictable effect on rainfall.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:48):**  And it's quickly becoming clear that even non-brittle landscapes are becoming susceptible  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:52):**  to both drought and inundation as precipitation patterns become less frequent and more severe.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:03:58):**  In this expert panel today, we'll discuss the ways that farmers can help to restore

**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:05:31):**  And of course, these are only just very short introductions.

**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:05:41):**  But to start us off, I would love to open up the discussion by asking what the potential  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:05:48):**  of a landscape with a restored water cycle can do.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:05:51):**  And it seems to me like there are some great examples that are very relevant right now  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:05:57):**  with the extreme climactic events that are happening in the US at the moment.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:02):**  Maybe starting with Mark, because you're really living this at the moment, as are the other  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:06):**  two, tell us about how your landscape has dealt with the challenges that you're currently  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:12):**  experiencing much differently than some of the surrounding farms.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:16):**  Well, some of the advantages, of course, are the fact that whenever it rains, all the ponds  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:24):**  fill up.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:25):**  I have, there's over 40 little, what I call pocket ponds on this property.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:31):**  There's amphibians right now that are all chirping outside, whereas around me, it's  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:35):**  almost cooked to a desert, it's so dry.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:41):**  So I get amphibians for insect control and that sort of thing.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:45):**  All that water spreads out, discharges at specific discharge zones.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:48):**  On this property, I designed them out to be on the ridges, which are stonier, dry, bonier  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:53):**  pieces of property.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:54):**  So the ridges, or even the ridges are green right now, whereas other hay fields are starting  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:06:58):**  to cook on the ridges.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:01):**  Some of the, it's not a downside, it appears to be a downside if you're growing row crops,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:07):**  is on wet years.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:08):**  So two years ago and three years ago, we had twice the normal rainfall, instead of 30,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:14):**  36 inches of rain, we got like 75 inches of rain in a year.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:18):**  So my annual crop fields, I basically didn't grow any annual crops that year, it was strictly  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:22):**  all perennials, because it was just too wet to get into the fields.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:29):**  I'll take too much rain instead of not enough rain.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:32):**  So the hydration of the landscape is key to absolutely everything.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:36):**  Without the water, your soil life doesn't wake up, it doesn't release the nutrients  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:40):**  for your crops, your plants, etc.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:42):**  You know, your livestock, you have to pump water, our water is 300 feet deep, if I want  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:46):**  to run that pump, it's like a dim the lights of the nearest villages, it's such a large  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:50):**  pump to bring it up.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:54):**  I'll hand it off to whoever's next.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:07:56):**  That's part of what it is here is, there's only been three times in my life on this farm  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:00):**  here in the past 25 years, that I actually cut and sold hay.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:05):**  And I cut and sold hay during a drought year, because I had green grass, and I cut and sold  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:11):**  hay.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:12):**  And if you're thinking about it, if you have green grass, you cut it as hay, it doesn't  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:15):**  get rained on, it's a drought year.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:17):**  What's the price of hay like when nobody else has hay?  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:21):**  So I got to capitalize on the fact that it had a high hay price with a highest quality,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:26):**  you know, never rained on hay during the drought years.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:29):**  So we're, you know, moderated, the extremes get moderated here because we have excellent  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:36):**  soil health because we have the water to wake up the soil life, deep rooted perennials,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:41):**  etc.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:42):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:43):**  And Nicole, tell us about some of the conditions where you are, as well as some of what you've  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:49):**  seen of the potential for restoring hydrological function on land to places that you visited  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:53):**  and traveled to.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:08:56):**  It's really interesting because we don't know how many thousand miles we did, maybe two  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:01):**  and a half thousand miles in the last two weeks, driving through Montana, Wyoming, Colorado,  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:07):**  South Dakota, and really, you know, seeing that picture of landscapes and total water  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:12):**  dysfunction.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:14):**  And unfortunately, I can't say as to any examples that we're like shining lights of having hydrology  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:19):**  that's really working, except for some of the properties that I'm working with here  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:23):**  in Montana.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:24):**  And, you know, it's really the difference between profitability and success and people  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:28):**  staying on the land and people leaving.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:31):**  And it is, you know, our ability to adapt to this is going to be the difference between  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:36):**  life and death, really.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:39):**  And so we've seen some extraordinary examples of water cycles that do work.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:45):**  And you know, what we're currently dealing with is, you guys call landscapes like watersheds,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:50):**  we call them water catchments.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:52):**  I think maybe if we changed it to a water catchment, instead of a shed, maybe we'd start  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:56):**  behaving a little differently.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:09:57):**  But it seems like these are landscapes that are shedding, like they're actively like,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:01):**  no, I don't want any water, just trying to repel these every single drop.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:06):**  And so the game that I play with some of my ranches is like, when someone says how much  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:11):**  rainfall did you get?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:12):**  You want to be able to say all of it.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:13):**  And this is what we're seeing in landscapes now is how do we restore that sponge, which  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:18):**  is going to lengthen your growing season, it's going to reduce plant stress, it's going  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:21):**  to increase nutrition, we're seeing big outbreaks and things like grasshoppers right now.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:26):**  That's all about plant stress.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:27):**  Yeah, so I mean, this is this is the game.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:31):**  How do we build our soil health?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:33):**  Nice.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:34):**  And Zach, why don't you tell us about some of the challenges that you're experiencing  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:38):**  out there in Oregon?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:39):**  Yeah, I mean, out here, it's severe drought conditions, the fire conditions are going  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:45):**  to be unlike, you know, last year is going to be a warm up if things don't change.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:52):**  And it really takes me back to 2019 in Australia and seeing that horrific fire season, I was  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:56):**  there right in the middle of it.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:10:58):**  And then seeing these wonderful properties that just show the potential of restoring  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:03):**  the hydrology.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:04):**  You had one Martin Royds, where the river was running dry, the town was running out  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:09):**  of water, but his leaky weirs were still discharging water.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:13):**  And so he was actually able to offer up his water to the community because he was the  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:16):**  only one that had it.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:18):**  You see people like Peter Marshall, who with his forestry management and hydrology management,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:23):**  he had the fire circle him for two months coming from every different angle.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:28):**  And he was able to take crown fires to ground fires.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:32):**  And then you go to India and look at people like Rajendra and you just see, you know,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:37):**  250,000 wells restored, seven rivers flowing perennial, and reducing the temperature in  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:44):**  the whole region two degrees Celsius.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:47):**  Wow, that is so cool.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:50):**  That is really remarkable.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:51):**  And it, it goes to show that, I mean, you don't necessarily have to do this on an entire  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:11:57):**  giant landscape to start to see the benefits.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:00):**  Although obviously the larger that you scale it up, the more that this can transform an  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:04):**  entire let's say water catchment instead of watershed.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:08):**  So from there, let's move to ask what are some of the first steps in determining the  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:13):**  necessary interventions to repair the hydrology on a landscape?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:18):**  And I've talked to you about this Zach in the past.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:20):**  So why don't we start with you?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:22):**  Because you've really developed a skill set of going to a client's place or a piece of  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:27):**  land and reading the landscape for those indicators that give you an insight into what interventions  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:33):**  would be the first steps.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:35):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:37):**  I think it really starts with the nature of the landscape itself, doing a really honest  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:41):**  assessment of it, understanding what its natural tendencies are.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:46):**  From that, you can already start to see a little bit of a timeline of how that landscape  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:51):**  has changed by reading different ways and patterns that water is moving through the  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:56):**  landscape.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:12:57):**  You can actually sometimes see some very clear things that were done previously, like dredging  
**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:01):**  of waterways, straighter, drainage systems, drain tile, all of these watershed things  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:08):**  that are really leading to these issues.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:11):**  And so then looking at, it's always important to consider the goals of the people, because  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:15):**  if you don't, you can make this beautiful paradise that just gets bulldozed because  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:19):**  people didn't value it or understand it.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:21):**  And then trying to figure out, I'm oftentimes working or looking in the margins.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:25):**  So so many farms around America and around the world have all of these margin lands that  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:31):**  are too wet to really farm, they're too steep and gullies, and so they end up being the  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:36):**  only forest left on the farm.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:38):**  But they're also oftentimes the points where you can do a little bit of work to restore  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:43):**  hydrology in a big portion of the earth.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:47):**  So it's really a matter of looking at the shape of the land, the geological consistency  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:52):**  of the land, and then an idea of how water moves through the landscape, the yearly precipitation  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:13:58):**  cycles, how much catchment areas you have.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:01):**  And then you can put those together to see where basically the acupuncture points are  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:06):**  for the hydrology within the land.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:08):**  Excellent.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:09):**  And Nicole, in your experience, what are some of the first things that you look for when  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:14):**  assessing the impactful things that you can do to restore the hydrological function of  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:21):**  a piece of land?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:22):**  How about forest creation?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:23):**  Well, yeah, some of the first things I guess around hydrology is to take, like Zach says,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:29):**  take a step back.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:30):**  And what I'm looking for, what are the drivers that have created this current system?  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:36):**  Why is that water system not functioning like it should?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:39):**  We might be looking for things like, you know, is there actual water repellency?  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:43):**  Are there waxy coatings in these soils?  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:45):**  What's happening with aggregate stability?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:48):**  How well is the system actually infiltrating?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:51):**  And then I have a process that I call the five M's to look for what is it that's the  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:56):**  underlying leverage point behind this?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:14:58):**  You know, is it your mindset?  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:00):**  Like a you part of the problem?  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:01):**  And generally that is what we find is the biggest issue with water cycles is the human.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:08):**  Is that your management, which quite often it is, is it low organic matter?  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:12):**  Is it a microbial imbalance or a mineral imbalance?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:15):**  And we kind of go to work from that perspective in terms of, all right, why is it that we  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:20):**  now have environments that are actually literally shedding water?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:24):**  Is it due to a lack of diversity?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:27):**  What can we do to kind of, yeah, really speed up that transition.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:32):**  So when I'm working with someone and they're first started down this journey, I look to  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:38):**  air before I look to water, because if your air, that air movement, porosity, all of that  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:43):**  isn't working, then your water cycle is going to be stuffed.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:46):**  So we kind of have a process and actually there's a process even before that, which  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:50):**  is sunlight capture.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:51):**  How well are we capturing sunlight in this environment?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:54):**  Because you know, that sunlight is going to be drawing sugars down into the soil.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:15:58):**  And if you've ever noticed this, if you have like a cup of sugar, white sugar sitting on  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:03):**  a bench, you'll see how quickly it gets a crust on the outside of that surface.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:07):**  That sugar that's being drawn down from the plant into soil as she draws water to it too  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:12):**  at a very, very dry condition.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:13):**  So you know, I'm working a lot in semi arid environments and this is the game that we're  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:20):**  out to achieve.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:21):**  Wow, those are some cool insights that I hadn't considered.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:25):**  Actually looking at the air in the landscape was not an answer that I would have predicted.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:30):**  How about you, Mark?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:31):**  With all the consultancies that you're doing and certainly the range of places that you've  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:35):**  seen, including your own farm, what have been some of the interventions that you look to  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:40):**  do for the highest impact?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:43):**  Well, I wanted to ditto everything that Zach said, everything that Nicole said.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:49):**  And then one of the things that Zach mentioned is what I'm kind of notorious for is I'm looking  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:54):**  for the ditches on the side of the road, the edges of this and that and the other thing.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:16:58):**  What is actually surviving in this region all by itself with sheer total utter neglect?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:04):**  And then that tells me that if I want to have a system that can subsist there for a long  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:09):**  period of time with no care whatsoever, I should plant species very closely related  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:15):**  to that in systems that are very similar to it.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:19):**  The shape of the land has a lot to do with it as well.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:24):**  Where is the water captured?  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:26):**  Where does the water flow?  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:28):**  Where does it end up either infiltrating or running away?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:32):**  Classic example in the USA anyways, and I know both Zach and Nicole have seen these,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:37):**  the USDA will come into a landscape, some farmer has a wet spot down at the bottom of  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:43):**  the catchment.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:44):**  I like the idea of changing our language so it's not a watershed anymore.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:48):**  And USDA will put a pond down there because that's where all the water goes to.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:17:53):**  Well, if it's down at the bottom of the landscape, now it has to be very deeply and after all  
**[0:18:01-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:01):**  that water that is up, it's most expensive, the most fragile, the most likely to blow  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:09):**  out because of the quantity of water that's hitting it.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:13):**  And the only reason why that spot is a wet spot is because the water didn't soak in up  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:16):**  there where it actually fell on the ground and it was allowed to run.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:20):**  So by using the shape of the land, capturing the water up high, spreading the water out,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:25):**  soaking it in, discharging it where we decide to discharge it, setting it up in a pattern  
**[0:18:30-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:30):**  that makes it easy to use equipment with, all of those things are a part of the system.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:38):**  But the most significant probably with what our team does is looking to as closely mimic  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:46):**  the natural ecosystem as closely as possible and substituting harvested for human food,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:53):**  animal feed, and then use animals as the managers of the system.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:18:58):**  So we're doing ecosystem restoration with agriculturally productive species.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:03):**  We're not necessarily...  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:04):**  Matter of fact, we don't plant orchards and we're not doing purest ecological restorations  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:09):**  where you use herbicide to get rid of every invasive.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:12):**  We're making agriculturally productive landscapes that are modeled after natural ecosystems.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:18):**  Amazing.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:19):**  And since you've worked in all types of places, different climates, different parts of the  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:24):**  world, have you started to notice any patterns of what the common degradation factors of?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:31):**  Basically, so many times the problems are better solved by removing the damaging element  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:37):**  or the practice that is causing the damage rather than adding some sort of bandaid feature.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:43):**  So I guess what I'm trying to say is what are some of the most damaging practices of  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:47):**  a landscape or their features that should be removed before other interventions can  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:53):**  actually be effective?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:54):**  I guess I'll start with the open.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:57):**  Yeah, yeah, go for it.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:19:59):**  For what I've seen around the world and you do the historical research, it has everything  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:20:03):**  to do with annual crops agriculture.

**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:20:11):**  we have to learn how to do it radically different.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:20:13):**  We have to improve the soils, we have to capture what rainfall comes in, soak it in, and minimize

**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:20:25):**  organic matter, off-gassing into the atmosphere, the ammonia, the nitrous oxides that are going

**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:20:33):**  And just the wind erosion, oh my gosh, last time I was in Oregon, they were harvesting

**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:20:51):**  which are orchards, they planted on level flat ground, and they remove every speck of

**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:06):**  that was around because it was too crisp and too brittle, burnt up all around us.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:12):**  This kind of our entire method of doing agriculture has been a disaster for the past 10,000 years.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:19):**  Yeah, it's intense.

**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:23):**  What are some of the damaging elements and practices on landscapes that you've seen that  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:27):**  need to be addressed before solutions can be implemented?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:31):**  Yeah, I would say really ditto to everything Mark just said.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:36):**  And for me, I would break it down into the humanity has really changed how water is moving  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:40):**  through the air and how water is moving through the ground.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:43):**  We've changed how water is moving through the air by getting rid of all the forest that  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:48):**  dominated the planet, that seeded the clouds, both with the moisture itself that's required  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:54):**  for 50% of the precipitation we received, but also with the hygroscopic microorganisms,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:21:59):**  which coalesce humid hazes into clouds and then rain, which is then also changing weather  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:05):**  patterns, which is changing how much of the water from the ocean is moving through the  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:10):**  Earth's continents.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:12):**  So we're really destroying the air water cycle, or vegetative destruction, you could say, which  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:19):**  I think agriculture is the biggest thing there.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:24):**  Agriculture and forestry, even our forestry practices are atrocious all around the world.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:29):**  But then we're also changing how water is moving through the ground with all of these  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:32):**  drainage systems, with all the city infrastructure, with all of the roads that exist, all our  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:36):**  water shedding structures with attached drainage to carry the water even further away.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:42):**  And I think it's important to recognize that there was a time when this served us, when  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:47):**  the Earth was a really lush, beautiful place with water landscapes all over the place,  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:53):**  and we were defecating in the streets.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:22:56):**  We didn't want standing water around our civilizations because of disease vectors and all these other  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:00):**  issues.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:01):**  We're doing the same water management, even though that doesn't suit us anymore, and now  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:06):**  it's actually causing all of these issues of flood, of drought, and of fire.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:13):**  So the drainage of the water in the ground, a lot of which was actually to create our  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:18):**  agricultural areas, we drained the wetlands to release the best soils, and then the drainage  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:24):**  of the water cycle through the air, through manipulating the vegetation and changing how  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:29):**  water moves through the continents.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:33):**  And Nicole, what about from your experience?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:36):**  Not quite ready to poop in the streets again, Zach, though, if that's an option.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:41):**  I'm ready.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:42):**  I'm ready to make that claim.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:48):**  I mean, so many of our practices really put microbiology on a starvation diet and anything  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:55):**  involving bare soil.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:23:56):**  So if that's cultivation or spraying out or overgrazing, desertification, all of whatever's  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:02):**  creating those kind of practices needs to shift.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:05):**  And I really point to Mark's, what he was drawing forward in terms of monocultures,  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:11):**  but just thinking in terms of diversity, like everything needs to be considered in terms  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:15):**  of how do we increase diversity here?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:17):**  How do we increase that mosaic factor in landscapes?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:22):**  Because most landscapes, like if you go to early colonial kind of accounts, they were  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:29):**  mosaics.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:30):**  They were like, we just have solid forest, which might have been because there's fires,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:35):**  there's ruminants, there's all sorts of things moving through landscapes.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:38):**  So how do we kind of look to recreate that?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:41):**  And for me, it's the micro that's influencing the macro.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:45):**  And it's that how do we get just that sponge reestablished?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:49):**  So what are the things that are undermining it?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:51):**  And if you think every single microbe in the soil is made up of at least 70% water, there  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:24:57):**  are a huge component of just how water is moving through the soil is with microbiology,  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:01):**  or even how fungi will bring water from much further down in the soil profile up to plants.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:08):**  But it won't do that if you've undermined it by having bare soil or cultivating or pretty  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:13):**  much everything in our toolkit of modern agriculture is what's led us to this point.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:18):**  And I think that's what we're seeing globally is this wake up of this is probably one of  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:22):**  the shortest exoduses into a type of agriculture.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:25):**  I mean, we're really only maybe 120 years, 140 years, and it's like, that didn't work.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:31):**  I mean, many of what we saw in China or Mayan civilizations, there were thousands of years  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:36):**  with their agricultural innovations.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:38):**  And this one really has been a very short, sharp jerk on the reins.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:44):**  And part of how we get the diversity and part of how we get to all the different soil life  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:48):**  and different depths of rooting, etc.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:51):**  And it's a tool that we rely on heavily break up the field sizes, etc. is the agroforestry  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:56):**  techniques.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:25:57):**  I see the agroforestry techniques as kind of like this bridge between the agriculture  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:02):**  of eradication and an agriculture of restoration.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:07):**  And then when we get to a silvopasture system, which is an agroforestry system with all these  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:13):**  woody plants and animals in it, to me, that seems like the that's that's the home run.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:20):**  That's the whole...  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:21):**  Do you think Mark, like a lot of the landscapes, like if you think of coming through Colorado,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:26):**  Wyoming, South Dakota, they wouldn't, they didn't never really had a lot of trees.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:31):**  So do you think?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:33):**  Yeah, tell me about that.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:35):**  Well, that that that goes to a regionally appropriate, specifically applied set of techniques.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:43):**  It would be fewer trees in the more arid areas, more trees in the moisture, more humid areas.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:49):**  You know, there's trees in Greenland and up, it's almost at the North Pole.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:26:55):**  They may be only willows about this tall, but they're every single continent has woody  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:00):**  plants on them, period.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:02):**  And so to imitate that distribution pattern with our agricultural crops, and if we can  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:09):**  go to our agricultural crops being the perennials, all of a sudden, we have a perennial ecosystem  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:15):**  that's producing food, fuels, medicines and fibers.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:18):**  So yeah, maybe in Arizona, for example, the trees would be further apart, they'd obviously  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:23):**  be different species.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:24):**  And I think it was in Arizona that they dug up a mesquite, and they kept chasing the roots  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:30):**  down.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:31):**  And at 412 feet deep, they decided it was too dangerous to keep digging.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:35):**  And the roots were still the sickness of a pencil.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:38):**  So all of this talk about like perennial grasslands are so wonderful, they hold the soil together,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:42):**  dang, you can't beat a tree.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:45):**  But certainly that location specific context and doing a proper inventory, not only of  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:51):**  what grows well there, but also what grew there historically.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:27:55):**  And like you do for agricultural landscapes, finding related plants that have some sort  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:01):**  of economic value that can take the place of less productive species, right?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:07):**  And you have to also project future and do some assisted migration.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:12):**  And you know, the New Forest Farm here, the southwest corner of it has species that are  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:18):**  more adapted to Colorado, for example, than they are in Wisconsin, because I want something  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:23):**  that can handle cold and dry because it gets both here.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:28):**  And then the northeastern corner of this property, we have a lot more of the way further north  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:32):**  plants.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:33):**  So we have the genetic resources on site, we're constantly breeding and selecting for  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:38):**  the varieties that actually thrive in this system here.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:42):**  And if we have to go, you know, more colder, hotter, wetter, drier, we've got the species  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:46):**  on board, and we're ready to put them in the ground.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:50):**  Time for a time for big, beautiful experiments with, you know, PhDs and stuff like that.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:28:56):**  We still need it, but dang, to wait for more research, the time is over, you know, we know  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:01):**  what to do, we have all the tools at our disposal, we just got to get stuff done.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:05):**  I almost said the S word stuff.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:09):**  I think too, to build off of what both of you guys are saying, it's the trees and the  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:14):**  fungi are responsible for bringing so much moisture up from down deep.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:18):**  And I've seen a lot of landscapes that used to have trees in the past, where you go four  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:24):**  feet down, and there's actually water in the whole landscape, but none of the plant roots  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:28):**  can reach it because the trees used to be the ones that had the deep roots to bring  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:32):**  it up.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:33):**  So you know, in areas like Yakima, where you look and it's like, oh, man, this is a desert  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:37):**  trees could never survive here, there actually were it was a dotted landscape with trees  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:42):**  on all of the braids of the earth, all the creeks and the streams and the rivers, they  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:46):**  were actually actively helping move that water up into the higher horizons as well so that  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:51):**  the grasses and other species could utilize it.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:55):**  And then if you think about the impact that we're seeing in Western Australia from the  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:29:59):**  removal of trees, because that's an open savanna land that had a lot of, you know, big old  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:04):**  mama and papa trees, is that that's totally changing that water dynamic in the soil now.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:09):**  So we're seeing, I think, the salinity of 50 million acres in Western Australia, because  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:14):**  that whole water cycle is disrupted, because the trees potentially, you know, that they're  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:18):**  using that water in that top zone without the trees that's just being sucked up by the  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:22):**  sun and drying conditions and evaporation.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:25):**  And here comes the salts.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:27):**  So, yeah, I mean, I think that's that whole landscape context.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:32):**  Have you guys seen that new research about how trees are growing faster because of the  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:38):**  carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:40):**  I know I threw this to you last time, Zach, about it seemed to me like I've gone to so  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:44):**  many places where standing forests are dying.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:48):**  And if that's in Australia or New Zealand or here, are you guys seeing something similar  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:53):**  like that happening?  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:54):**  And I'm wondering, like, is it turning to a grassland ecosystem that can be adapted  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:30:58):**  to low rainfall?  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:00):**  Just to throw it.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:03):**  I see a lot of dying forests.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:06):**  Most of the ones that I see, I really look at as nature is actually trying to help because  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:10):**  it's not a forest, it's a tree farm.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:13):**  So most of the most of the dying forest that I see, I would really say are more tree farms  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:19):**  and are whether being managed actively or not, they're having the structural issues  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:24):**  of a lack of diversity.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:26):**  And so all of the different species of nature are saying, hey, I can help this.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:29):**  I'll kill a bunch of these Doug firs and then we can start to have a more diverse forest.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:34):**  But we don't look at it as them helping us.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:36):**  No, see, that's not happening in New Zealand.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:38):**  These are diverse native forests that are dying.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:44):**  And as far as the like the full closed canopy forest is concerned, every single part of  
**[0:31:50-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:50):**  the USA, except for some places down in Florida, in most of Central America was all savannah.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:31:59):**  They're semi open grass forested areas, going all the way back to the dawn of woody species.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:07):**  So that has to be said, it's trees and grass have co-evolved in most of the places around  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:12):**  here.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:13):**  And then the die-offs that we're seeing here, if you think in the last hundred years, we  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:18):**  had white pine blister rust that has always been here because they've always been currents  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:23):**  and pines coexisting with each other, but it only blew up after we eradicated the massive  
**[0:32:27-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:27):**  fineries, then there was Dutch elm disease, there was chestnut blight, gypsy moth, and  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:37):**  now we've got the emerald ash borer, like Michigan's lost, you know, half, almost half  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:42):**  of the trees in its forest because of these non-native pests and diseases.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:49):**  Now in the long scope of history of time, that's not a problem.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:53):**  You know, nature will heal from that, but short term, if part of your economic livelihood  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:32:58):**  is depending on these forests as a resource and the certain native American tribes in  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:04):**  the Great Lakes region, they identify themselves by the ash tree, because that's all their

**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:12):**  So what do you do when the basis of your culture disappears because some bug from somewhere  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:18):**  else?  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:19):**  And looking at the comments over here, one of the folks had mentioned the megafauna,  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:25):**  whether you were in the Great Plains where you had mammoths, you know, the Pacific coast  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:32):**  where you had like three different kinds of mammoth, couple of different kinds of mastodons.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:37):**  Here in the humid east, it was mostly mastodon.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:42):**  There were always elephants around here knocking the trees over and eating the tops off of

**[0:33:47-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:47):**  Most of the savanna species are adapted, created, adapted, evolved, however they got here to  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:54):**  be pushed over and then sprout back up from the roots.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:33:57):**  Whether it's a storm that pushes it over or an elephant that pushes it over, there's a  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:01):**  depression, there's a mound and there's organic matter mixed with mineral soil.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:07):**  That is the number one microtopography form all across the planet, our pits and mounds.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:15):**  So when we're designing systems and I'm looking right behind Zach and I see some pits and

**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:23):**  mound builder, whatever.

**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:30):**  Swila, that sounds very Australian.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:33):**  Sorry about that.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:36):**  So you have your swales, USDA terraces, whatever, you have a water conveyance channel and a  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:41):**  mound to catch that water.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:43):**  So we're lining them up to direct that water where we want specifically over to some of  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:48):**  those ponds right behind Zach's heads.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:50):**  So are we, am I seeing forests accelerating in growth?  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:54):**  I don't have the data on that that says that and I'm seeing just a tremendous amount of  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:34:59):**  forests in trouble.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:00):**  Now we have the woolly adelgid on the hemlocks in the east, all kinds of outbreaks of pests  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:07):**  and diseases in forestry.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:08):**  And did you know that human beings have yet to eradicate one of them?  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:15):**  We've lost trying to fight against it, we've lost.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:18):**  So why don't we work with it understanding that these new climate conditions, new rainfall  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:25):**  patterns and new storm patterns and new insects and diseases, these are the new disturbance  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:30):**  patterns that are arising.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:32):**  We now have to adapt ourselves to the current reality by having a relationship with our  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:38):**  landscape and understanding how ecology itself actually works when applying that to what  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:44):**  we do raising crops and lifestyle.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:48):**  So there have been a couple of questions and even some short mentions already about the  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:52):**  risk of salinization of soils.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:35:55):**  Would anybody like to talk about how that can start to be reversed after maybe addressing  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:01):**  some of the risks of or the causes of how it starts in the first place?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:05):**  Nicole?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:06):**  Yeah, so a lot of the areas that I'm working on that have big salinization issues are often  
**[0:36:13-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:13):**  cropping.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:14):**  So we have more opportunities, I guess, in large scale cropping.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:17):**  And these are really flat lands as well.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:21):**  And these guys are looking at introducing alley species intercropping to some degree.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:28):**  But what they're doing is they can either put down things like a humic acid or vermicast  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:35):**  or compost extract.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:36):**  So it's the carbon or the humic fraction that that's the antidote in a lot of ways to sodium.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:43):**  So we're seeing some great shrinking of those saline seeps through the addition of carbon  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:49):**  based materials that's been phenomenal.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:52):**  But I think to getting trees back into the landscape and thinking, you know, what I'm  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:58):**  seeing is interesting is that a lot of rangeland is actually deficient in sodium.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:02):**  And the reason for that is very old landscapes have leached out and put that into these depressions.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:08):**  So we see areas that have gone alkaline.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:10):**  And it's like, well, where did that sodium come from?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:13):**  You know, a little bit came from landscape that's leached out.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:16):**  So I'm always looking for addressing that at the root cause.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:21):**  And then yeah, we  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:26):**  classic  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:27):**  it's the soil biology.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:29):**  You think of every single living cell, it's just a bag of salt water.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:33):**  You want to get rid of that salt, put it into bio.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:36):**  Amen to that, Mark.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:39):**  So one of the ideas or the suggestions that was in here was the idea of putting organic  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:44):**  matter on top of the soil as a remedy for salinization.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:48):**  Is that something that you found works fairly well?  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:52):**  I mean, it may be somewhat impractical on very large landscapes, but could that possibly  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:57):**  kickstart the biology that can digest those salts?  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:01):**  Not if you're not really addressing the underlying cause.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:04):**  And you think of a lot of these landscapes where they are issues.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:07):**  If you just throw compost on top, it just desiccates and flows away anyway, like the  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:12):**  microbiology aren't necessarily going to get down into the soil.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:15):**  So finding ways to protect that if you were putting carbon down, so direct drilling, putting  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:20):**  it down with seeds, coating seeds.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:24):**  We've had really good success with bale grazing, so the effect of just putting bales into the  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:28):**  middle of some of these areas and allowing livestock to kind of incorporate and trample  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:32):**  and massage that soil a bit to get organic material in there.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:36):**  But I think from a cost return on investment, like how long would you pay that off?  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:42):**  The bale grazing or even composts, you want to have really good compost.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:46):**  And most of the compost I see people applying is absolute garbage.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:51):**  So just being really careful, like if you're going to put some of that stuff on, is it  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:38:55):**  beautiful, you know, microbially diverse and alive, and finding ways to ensure that it's  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:02):**  not going to die when you put it out.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:05):**  I'll address that also as well, is that I'm totally into minimizing inputs.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:10):**  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to use three people that aren't here as an example.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:15):**  If we go to Gary Zimmer, he's talking about mineral balance, mineral balance, mineral  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:18):**  balance, mineral balance.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:19):**  So go ahead and get your cations perfectly balanced.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:22):**  And if you don't have enough water to light up the microbial life, it's not going to light  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:26):**  up.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:27):**  And you might have the wrong microbial life there when it does get rain, and it goes in  
**[0:39:32-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:32):**  a direction that you don't want.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:33):**  So then there's folks like Elaine Ingham, it's all about the bugs, the bugs, the bugs,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:36):**  it's a soil life, soil life, just put this tea on.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:39):**  But if you put them there, they don't have anything to eat, they're going to die just  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:41):**  like Nicole just said.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:43):**  Well, then there's the Gabe Brownies.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:45):**  Well, it's all about the cover crop smorgasbord.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:47):**  You put a zillion different cover crops down, but if you don't have the soil life there,  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:50):**  and if you don't have the right mineral balance there, and if you don't have the water there  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:39:54):**  in the first place, my personal opinion is that the water precedes everything.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:00):**  If we don't have water, we can't grow plants.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:02):**  If we don't have plants, we can't feed animals.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:05):**  We have to manage that water, rehydrate the landscape, then we can adjust our mineral  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:11):**  balance, our soil life, and our cropping mix.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:16):**  And then I'll add this fourth guy who happens to be here is me.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:19):**  If we're mimicking the natural plant community types of that region and that area, selecting  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:24):**  the food producing species from it will have the best chance of success when we do all  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:29):**  of those things.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:31):**  There's not one true answer here.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:34):**  It's all about the big system, the big ecological system of this planet.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:38):**  Yeah, I think it's just classic human reductionism to want to just distill it down to, oh, well,  
**[0:40:43-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:43):**  we just need to do this one thing when nature has never and never will work that way.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:50):**  It is this diverse interconnected web, and you can't just pull out one piece and study  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:56):**  it in isolation and learn anything about the whole.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:40:59):**  So yeah, I just echo that really anything to do with ecology, the interconnectedness  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:06):**  is the resilience of that ecosystem, and so you can't just pull out single elements.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:11):**  You really have to look at it as a whole.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:14):**  Yeah, which is why context is where it all comes down to.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:18):**  And I kind of run from the room screaming if anyone's got a single answer to anything.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:23):**  And it is really interesting because you see these beautiful examples that do work really  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:28):**  well in that context, and you've mentioned some of them, Mark, and then people try and  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:32):**  take that exact program and transplant it and put it on their place at huge expense  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:37):**  and often a whole lot of disasters.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:40):**  So yeah, for me, it starts with like compaction is the first place before water for me.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:47):**  So it's like trying to figure out what is it with compaction?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:50):**  And I know you guys like your iron or machinery to kind of address some of that, but it's  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:55):**  like, well, what's the underlying cause of that?  
**[0:41:57-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:57):**  Was that something I have done with my management?  
**[0:41:59-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:59):**  And if I open that soil up, what is going to be in there or is it something else that's  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:06):**  going to contribute to that water cycle?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:08):**  So yeah, I always get really curious about that whole ecosystem function.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:14):**  And most of the compaction issues that I encounter are caused by previous farming practices.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:22):**  And that's where, you know, yeah, you can do it purely biologically through time, but  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:26):**  you can get it faster, you know, a lot of results if you use steel, appropriately applied  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:31):**  steel.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:32):**  Notice appropriately applied, it's got to be context specific.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:35):**  A great example actually is Dakota Cohen up in Alberta.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:41):**  He went to workshop of mine and the media said, oh, I got to put ponds way up over here.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:45):**  So he went and he dug like a $30 million pond and it didn't fill because he was putting  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:49):**  it out of context within the scope of his landscape.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:52):**  And it wasn't until later that it dawned on him that I wasn't giving a prescription.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:42:59):**  I was getting a set of principles.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:01):**  We follow these set of principles and I loosely follow the whole yeoman scale of permanence  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:07):**  on what I decided to do first.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:08):**  And I'll grant you the point on, you know, breaking compaction to get the water to go  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:12):**  in because what good is actually water if it doesn't soak in, we can actually make things  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:20):**  worse.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:21):**  If you have water ponding in a particular area, you can start it into a cycle of anaerobic  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:26):**  collapse and you're going to go acidic and formaldehyde and then it'll be 20 years before  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:31):**  you get crops to grow there again.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:33):**  So once again, it's a systematic systems approach.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:37):**  So if there's one true answer, Nicole, please don't run out of the room.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:40):**  It's everything.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:41):**  The only thing that's going to make me run out of the room is you calling me an Australian  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:49):**  again.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:50):**  New Zealand.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:51):**  New Zealand.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:52):**  I don't know.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:53):**  The Australians were prisoners.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:54):**  That's right.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:55):**  You guys were free.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:56):**  We were free.  
**[0:43:57-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:43:58):**  We were not able to get the whole braid buns from anybody.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:03):**  Well, so look, it sounds like we're talking a lot or continuing to refer to the scale  
**[0:44:06-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:06):**  of permanence.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:07):**  And I know that that is a framework that a lot of people continue to use.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:11):**  And then Mark has expanded upon on his book, Water for Any Farm.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:16):**  Let's just address some of those, because starting with that land form, really the first  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:19):**  element that we can start to affect on a piece of land, busting up compaction, putting in  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:26):**  key line earthworks or ponds or catchment systems.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:30):**  Is that really where you would always start?  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:33):**  Or are there simpler interventions, especially for people with lower budgets or perhaps who  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:38):**  don't have access to professionals who can perform some of those services for them that  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:42):**  can make a difference without having to affect the land form itself?  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:48):**  I think I'd love to jump in there.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:50):**  I think one big piece, and Nicole mentioned this as well, that I think Darren Doherty  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:44:56):**  brought to the key line scale of permanence is the climate of the mind, because I think  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:00):**  that mindset and management, you got to look at those two things first, because you can  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:06):**  move all the earth in the world.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:08):**  And if you don't have the mindset in line with the landscape, you don't have a management  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:13):**  in line with the landscape, it's not going to go well, and you're going to cause more  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:17):**  harm than good.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:19):**  So I would say even taking it back to just that, you know, what am I doing on this landscape?  
**[0:45:24-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:24):**  What are my goals and what are my actions on the landscape?  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:27):**  And what is are the responses that the landscape gives me as a result of those?  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:32):**  Really a careful consideration of that, because that's oftentimes like you were saying earlier,  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:37):**  just to stop doing the harm can do more benefit than all of the big actions that you might  
**[0:45:43-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:43):**  take after you stop doing the harm.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:45):**  Yeah, I really encourage people to do like basic infiltration tests and just look at,  
**[0:45:49-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:49):**  you know, what is happening with compaction or water movement through soils, and then  
**[0:45:53-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:53):**  going back to what is it that created that was that, you know, is it just mismanagement?  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:45:59):**  Or is it that low organic matter?  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:01):**  Is it biology or minerals?  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:02):**  And so we find if we address that underlying driver, then so for instance, working on an  
**[0:46:07-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:07):**  operation that at 60% magnesium, I am not going to go and try and address that magnesium  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:13):**  minerally like across your fortune, but these soils with high mag become super tight.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:17):**  So all that we did was actually drill gypsum, a little bit of gypsum down with the drill  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:22):**  when we were seeding and that just flocculated and opened it up around that root zone.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:27):**  And then that plant was able to open that soil up.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:29):**  And that's where, you know, you could use a cover crop in that instance with a little  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:33):**  bit of gypsum just to flocculate and open it up.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:35):**  But if it's a biological issue, is it just very high bacterial soils and we see these  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:40):**  with the waxy coatings or surface crusts that the soils are not functional?  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:45):**  What is it that I can maybe do to stimulate other types of microbiology so that that could  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:50):**  be a compost or your bale grazing?  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:52):**  Again, it could be cover crops, they could fulfill on that.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:46:56):**  So we're always looking for what is it that's actually driving this because otherwise you're

**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:04):**  And you know, working in very different ecotypes and very different rainfall zones and very

**[0:47:13-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:13):**  one silver bullet answer to this.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:15):**  I love being on panels with people who give all my answers, it's perfect.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:23):**  I would add into that one piece I really like people to consider as far as just a first  
**[0:47:26-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:26):**  step on the land is what impact are you having on the water cycle?  
**[0:47:31-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:31):**  We all have homes, we all have roads, we might have a lot of roads, we might have more drainage.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:38):**  You know, just before we talk about having a benefit impact on the water cycle, we need  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:42):**  to gain neutrality.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:45):**  And oftentimes we're nowhere close to neutral.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:47):**  So looking at those impacts and looking at how you might directly offset them, you know,  
**[0:47:52-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:52):**  is it as simple as a rainwater rain garden catching the gutters off your building so  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:47:56):**  that that water that used to infiltrate into the earth can infiltrate into the earth?  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:01):**  Same for off of driveways or parking areas or anything like that.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:05):**  It's just a real easy win to look at what is my impact on this land?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:10):**  And how can I offset it?  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:11):**  I like your whole topic where you're going at with that, Zach.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:16):**  And just a couple things, especially with people in residential areas, be aware of the  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:21):**  fact that if you soak water into the soil, it's going to go into your basement and if  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:25):**  not your basement, somebody else's.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:26):**  So be careful, do context specific approaches, no matter where you are, check things out.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:32):**  Thank you.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:33):**  Very important point there.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:37):**  And then one of the things that you know, as a restoration ecologist is we're looking  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:43):**  at a target ecosystem or target plant community type.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:48):**  So by looking at the ditches and the edges on the side of the road, we find out where  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:52):**  this place wants to go all by itself.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:48:55):**  We preload it ahead of time, or we do floristic relays where we start with this species, introduce  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:00):**  the next one and the next one, the next one.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:02):**  And we have a target ecosystem of where it is actually going.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:06):**  And that's informed by what you learn on the ground.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:09):**  What you know, what is our neutral state as a human being?  
**[0:49:12-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:12):**  How do I interact with this land?  
**[0:49:14-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:14):**  And then design the whole land use pattern to enhance that process.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:23):**  And one of the things that I think should happen, there's probably some people who are  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:26):**  listening that are into that, like live in suburban areas, if you're in the USA, and  
**[0:49:31-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:31):**  you're in a suburban area, start attempting to pass laws that save that every single home,  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:39):**  single family home in the USA, it can heat itself, it can power itself, it can provide  
**[0:49:45-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:45):**  its own water from the ambient environment, period.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:49):**  It's a design consideration.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:51):**  If our homes don't heat themselves, cool themselves, power themselves and capture their own water,  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:49:58):**  we have designed things wrong.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:00):**  Until we've done that, that's the work that has to happen.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:04):**  And if you're going to buy a home or build a new home, if you do it any other way, besides  
**[0:50:11-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:11):**  heating itself, powering itself, cooling itself, providing its own water, you screwed up, stop.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:19):**  I imagine you guys have read Michael Mob's book, The Sustainable House, which I think  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:23):**  was written in 1999.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:25):**  And he's transformed his community in Sydney through that very thing.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:29):**  Like how do you capture, how do you totally close the loops externally or internally,  
**[0:50:35-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:35):**  which is so phenomenal.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:36):**  And I think it would revolutionize cities right now.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:39):**  But I think there's almost an agenda to stop this.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:41):**  They looked at this in Auckland City of what would be the cost to actually put in these  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:45):**  huge pipelines from a river that was pretty far away to pump that into Auckland City.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:51):**  And it would have been much cheaper to put a water catchment system on every single house  
**[0:50:55-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:55):**  and not be compromising that river.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:50:57):**  But you know they went to the river, they're not going to be like empowering people.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:00):**  You can't be off the grid now, Mark.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:01):**  How can we control you now?  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:05):**  So many good points here.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:06):**  I would love to go in.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:07):**  This is my old specialty is designing natural homes with like full functionality and how  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:12):**  they integrate in with their local ecosystems.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:16):**  But since we're getting closer to the listener questions, there's one more I'd like to ask  
**[0:51:20-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:20):**  before we start to hand it over and is actually voiced very well by Tony here.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:27):**  But the idea is, what are some of the common misconceptions and misunderstandings that  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:33):**  you find that a lot of people have that are somewhat common either in cultures around  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:38):**  the world or just general understandings of agroecology that you'd like to try and dispel  
**[0:51:43-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:43):**  here or sort of correct the record on in order to give a better understanding or I guess  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:50):**  write over some of these things that hold a lot of people back with their management  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:54):**  of water.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:51:55):**  I just have to jump in quick and it's the most frustrating to me is that most people  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:00):**  don't believe this.

**[0:52:03-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:03):**  And then they want you to pencil it out so it pays itself back with 55% return on investment  
**[0:52:07-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:07):**  in two years.

**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:28):**  Yeah, you think it costs a lot now to try not having water in a couple of years and  
**[0:52:33-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:33):**  what it costs to import it.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:36):**  And we're already seeing that now.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:38):**  And I was doing a workshop in Western Australia and Alana McTernan actually came and opened  
**[0:52:43-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:43):**  the workshop.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:44):**  She was the Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:47):**  And her message was, you know, if we're not adapting these practices and regenerating  
**[0:52:50-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:50):**  landscapes then there will be no agriculture in Australia in the next 10 years.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:52:56):**  Like she was really like, and it's like, I go into workshops for large scale conventional  
**[0:53:00-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:00):**  cropping guys and the depression and the, it's almost like that that mindset and the  
**[0:53:07-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:07):**  ability to even think outside the box is so degraded because of mental and physical well

**[0:53:18-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:18):**  So it's like start with yourself, start eating well, start looking after your body and then  
**[0:53:25-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:25):**  what becomes possible.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:26):**  Because I see people that are no longer able to take any different actions.

**[0:53:35-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:35):**  And probably the other thing I hear is like, it's not possible here.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:39):**  It's all very well that Mark can do it in his landscape.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:41):**  It's so easy.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:42):**  You know, it's easy in Western Australia or I mean, I hear it from Australians, you know,  
**[0:53:46-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:46):**  New Zealanders can do it, but I hear in New Zealand, oh no, it only happens in Australia  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:50):**  or America.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:51):**  And it's like, we will ignore what's happening right in front of us instead of going actually,  
**[0:53:56-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:56):**  I wonder what is possible here.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:53:58):**  Like where's the curiosity in agriculture?  
**[0:54:01-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:01):**  And that's what I'd really like to see lit up again.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:03):**  It is like that mind fire.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:05):**  Let's get excited.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:06):**  Yeah, I would totally agree with that.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:09):**  And building upon that, I'd say two, I have three misconceptions that really bother me.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:15):**  One being people thinking, oh, that doesn't affect me here.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:19):**  Until the fire is at their doorstep, they are not thinking about water.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:24):**  So that's a really big one.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:26):**  Another one that just really bothers me is people do not connect pumping out of the aquifers  
**[0:54:32-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:32):**  with a degradation of the hydrology.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:35):**  It's like, oh, that water's free.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:37):**  It's just in the ground for me to pump out as quick and fast as I possibly can to use  
**[0:54:42-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:42):**  however I want and whatever that flow rate on your well, which is the max that well can  
**[0:54:46-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:46):**  support.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:47):**  That's what I should be pumping all the time.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:49):**  So that's one that really bothers me.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:52):**  And then a third one is that the ecosystems don't have an impact on climate, which we  
**[0:54:57-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:57):**  know very much so they do.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:59):**  You change the ecosystem of a place, you change the precipitation of a place, you change the  
**[0:55:04-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:55:04):**  drought and fire and flood regime of a place.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:55:07):**  And these are really all direct consequences of our actions.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:55:11):**  We just don't understand that puzzle yet.

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 04:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:40):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:14):**  Every Monday, to get your week started off right, I'll send you a new regenerative  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:18):**  skill that you can develop and expand on in your own life right away.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:22):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:26):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:31):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:36):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:42):**  Though I've spoken to some great orchardists through this podcast, many of them are growing  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:46):**  cold tolerant trees in far northern climates.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:49):**  But I wanted to get a perspective on running a holistically mannered orchard in the tropics  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:53):**  to explore how the beneficial interactions between some of the most prized tree and perennial  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:01:57):**  products in the world can be grown in a way that fuels the restoration of these incredibly  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:02):**  biodiverse and robust ecosystems.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:04):**  I've known quite a few orchardists from back in Guatemala where I used to live and work,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:09):**  and I'll link to those interviews in the show notes for this episode for a wide perspective  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:12):**  on the topic, but in this interview we'll take a look in the cloud forest of the Ecuadorian  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:17):**  Amazon to see how the team at Mashpee Artisinal Chocolate have brought their piece of land  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:22):**  back from being a degraded and deforested pasture to a thriving rainforest cacao plantation  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:28):**  that has brought back the biodiversity to their forests through a method they call analog  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:32):**  forestry.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:34):**  Now in this interview I spoke with Alejandro Solano, who co-owns and manages Mashpee Chocolate  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:39):**  as the resident reserve ecologist.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:42):**  Apart from knowing in depth everything that has to do with the cultivation of cacao and  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:46):**  working directly in its production, he's in charge of planting other species that accompany  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:50):**  the cacao trees and ensures their health throughout the whole ecosystem management.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:02:55):**  He also conducts ongoing research on biodiversity and is a naturalist with a sharp eye and intuition.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:01):**  Along with helping to manage the business and land, he also guides visitors and gives  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:05):**  workshops on the farm project and the reserve.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:08):**  Now in this interview we start by defining analog forestry and its defining aspects.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:13):**  From there we explore the larger vision of cloud forest restoration that the cacao production  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:18):**  is merely one aspect of.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:20):**  Alejandro also explains how the preservation of the genetics of his cacao is helping to  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:25):**  preserve the biocultural heritage of Ecuador and its history as well.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:30):**  Towards the end we also go through all the steps of producing some of the highest quality  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:33):**  chocolate available from seed all the way to the chocolate bar.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:38):**  Now my mouth is watering just thinking back on this discussion so I'll hand things over  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:41):**  now to Alejandro.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:44):**  Hey Alejandro, thank you so much for making time to be with me today.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:47):**  How are you doing in Ecuador?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:49):**  Hello Oliver, I'm doing okay, thank you very much.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:53):**  It's a pleasure for me to be in the interview as well.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:56):**  Hey, the pleasure's all mine.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:03:58):**  I'm really looking forward to talking to you about the intricacies of restoring a rainforest  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:03):**  while also producing world-class quality cacao.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:07):**  But before we get into all of the details of how you do that, why don't you tell our  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:11):**  listeners a little bit about your personal background and just how did you get into growing  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:16):**  cacao as a way of restoring the native forest?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:19):**  Okay folks, well my name is Alejandro Solano.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:23):**  I am originally from Costa Rica in Central America.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:27):**  I study a little bit of ecology and sustainable development.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:32):**  And while in university I met my Ecuadorian wife, Agustina.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:38):**  And soon after we finished with classes we decided to come to Ecuador because there was  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:42):**  a lot more to do here than in my home country in terms of conservation, restoration and  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:48):**  so on.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:49):**  So when we got here we started to work with the family that live in a small reserve in  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:55):**  the cloud forest.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:04:57):**  And we diversified the farm with tourism, with shade grown coffee.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:02):**  And after about three, four years working there we had the opportunity with a local  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:08):**  NGO to get access to a new piece of land to create yet another reserve.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:15):**  But this time more in the foothills in the beginning of the Andes.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:20):**  So we started in a farm that used to be pastures and we saw the potential of doing a different  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:28):**  type of restoration.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:30):**  And in this one we decided then to start work with polycultures instead of monocultures.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:36):**  And in this one also involving a very important plant for Ecuador as it is cacao.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:43):**  That's amazing how you've gotten basically to work in all of these incredible places  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:47):**  having started out in Costa Rica.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:49):**  Now before we dive into more of like your personal journey of transforming the landscape,  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:05:55):**  on your website you talk about how you're practicing a type of forestry called analog  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:01):**  forestry.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:02):**  And I've heard of a lot of different methods including syntropic farming and things along  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:07):**  different management techniques for forestry.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:10):**  Could you tell me what exactly is analog forestry?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:13):**  Okay, yes.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:15):**  It's a very interesting tool.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:18):**  It's a way of planting trees and other plants, not only trees, but in a way that you use  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:25):**  the forest as a model.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:27):**  So, historically around the world we've seen different type of agroforestry from the simplest  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:36):**  in modern times which is just one timber tree next to a plant of corn.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:43):**  And very simple, just repeat that in many lines and you have an agroforestry system.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:49):**  But it is very, very weak because it is only two species and it's more prone to pests,  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:06:56):**  very poor in diversity in food and so on.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:00):**  So some years ago a folk from Sri Lanka, PhD Dr. Ranil Senenayake started to study the  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:10):**  food systems, the productive food systems of the countryside of Sri Lanka.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:16):**  And he realized that the farmers were putting a whole lot of different species together.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:21):**  In that way, working more effectively using the land not only on the horizon but also  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:29):**  vertically.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:30):**  So analog forest is a tool that over the years he has developed and shared around the world,  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:36):**  now in more than 20 countries.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:38):**  And well, we start by going to the forest and having a look at it.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:42):**  And we see the structure of the forest and then we come to our plot where we maybe needed  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:49):**  to be restored.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:51):**  And then we try to see what elements, what features are missing.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:07:55):**  And then planning little by little a design, we start filling in the gaps with plants that  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:01):**  are useful for human beings.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:05):**  So we look for a tree that has a big crown as is in the forest but that for instance  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:11):**  produces nuts that we don't have to climb the tree to get.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:15):**  But the tree would shed for us and we just pick from the ground.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:19):**  And little by little there is also the creation of not only a structure but ecological functions.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:26):**  So that also helps us because we have the cycle of nutrients on site.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:31):**  We try to avoid bringing external inputs as much as possible.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:38):**  And it's very useful also that little by little this structure and this ecological function  
**[0:08:44-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:44):**  brings in also other wildlife that is important for things such as the stability of the system.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:52):**  So in this way there is less chances of pests and problems that attack the crops.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:08:59):**  It's a really cool tool.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:01):**  I think there's a lot more to be said about it.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:05):**  But for now as an introduction I think it's good.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:08):**  You can look up for more resources online on analogforestry.org.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:14):**  Yeah that gives me a really good introduction into this.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:17):**  So you mentioned how the analog forestry method gave you an opportunity to look at the damaged  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:23):**  ecosystem that you came into as a designer and identify what was missing so that you  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:28):**  could replace some of those pieces with plants and ecosystem elements that suited your production  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:36):**  model.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:37):**  Can you tell me a little bit about what was missing when you got there and what you decided  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:40):**  to put in including the cacao and where it fits in with that forestry model?  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:46):**  Okay yeah it's very interesting.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:50):**  Well first of all the plots that we started at they used to be pastures.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:09:56):**  So basically there was grass with a few you know trees on the edge here in the tropics  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:02):**  are used as live fences.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:05):**  The Guayaba what in the US called Waba fruit was there and maybe a few other very secondary  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:14):**  forest species very abundant things but nothing much than that maybe one or two trees in the  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:20):**  middle isolated.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:21):**  So if you compare to the forest, the forest is multi-layer.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:26):**  First of all here in the tropics very important maybe five, six, seven, eight sometimes layers  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:33):**  from the highest 30, 40 or 50 meters high tree to the shrubs and the seedlings sprouting  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:39):**  at the base of the big mother trees.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:42):**  So we use something very important in analog forestry and that is the concept of natural  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:48):**  succession.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:49):**  So when we want to bring the forest back and we want to bring analog forests so we have  
**[0:10:56-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:10:56):**  to be patient first of all and start with the species that can take the light gap situation  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:06):**  open country situation more efficiently.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:10):**  So in order to do this and take it into account that we had also compacted soils because of  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:16):**  the poor practices and the management of the cows that are common here.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:22):**  We also had to work what plants to use to soften the soil.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:27):**  So first of all we started planting a lot of banana trees because banana trees grow  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:32):**  well in the sun.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:34):**  They have big leaves they can protect the soil from the rain that there is no more compactation  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:42):**  and together with the bananas we put a lot of legume trees.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:49):**  Those are very important because they fix nitrogen in the soil and start getting energy  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:53):**  back in and together with that we also put a lot of cassava.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:11:58):**  Cassava is a root that you eat in the tropics known as yucca here locally and that is very  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:06):**  important because it also likes the sun, grows well as it is growing.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:12):**  It's also growing the roots underneath and that is helping to decompact the soil.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:18):**  So in a very brief way we use these three main plants just to help with catching as  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:26):**  much light as possible, transforming it and at the same time setting us free from having  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:32):**  to use what is very common worldwide which is herbicides.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:36):**  Many people use herbicides because they think that there is bad weeds.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:40):**  I don't think or we don't think there are bad weeds.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:43):**  We think there are bad in foreign farmers sometimes that is a bit different.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:50):**  And so basically you were accelerating the recovery of the forest by putting in these  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:55):**  interim species.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:12:56):**  Did that also help you to make sort of a shorter term profit that kept the financial aspect  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:02):**  of waiting for longer term perennials like the cacao and other tree species to mature  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:09):**  and keep the farm viable up until then?  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:12):**  That is a very good point and that is why we like analog forestry because it is a long  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:19):**  journey, it is a beautiful journey and in each of the steps of the natural succession  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:24):**  you can profit from different crops.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:27):**  In the beginning as you were saying we start with the sun loving crops which are also a  
**[0:13:32-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:32):**  lot of energy which are needed by us the farmers to start setting the plots, to start working  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:42):**  and in the initial stage of our project we didn't have anything to do much with cacao  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:49):**  processing or selling because cacao takes three to four years to produce.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:53):**  So in the beginnings we were selling papayas, we were selling bananas, we were selling cassava,  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:13:59):**  we were canning the very first product that we processed here was Heart of Palm.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:04):**  Heart of Palm is interesting because it is one of the most interesting plants in the  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:11):**  area because many people manage this plant as monoculture but we for the first time here  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:16):**  put it in a polyculture and in the early years we harvested the Heart of the Palm, we processed  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:23):**  it and that gave us the income to keep going.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:26):**  Now those palm trees are eight, nine meters high and they are producing fruit, we are  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:32):**  eating the fruit and then it is interesting to see in this way that how the same plant  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:38):**  over time can give you different benefits also.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:42):**  Yeah that's incredible that you've really managed all of these successional transformations  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:48):**  leading up towards a more mature forest.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:51):**  So tell me about how you transitioned or utilized that energy early on that you were talking  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:14:57):**  about and the income needed to propel you to what you were building up to which is an  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:03):**  agroforestry model based around cacao as your main production species.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:09):**  How have you worked towards there and kind of what stage are you at now?  
**[0:15:13-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:13):**  Well something very important for us has been the use of our own farm-made organic fertilizers  
**[0:15:22-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:22):**  together with planting trees which is very important of the greatest diversity as possible  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:30):**  as your local forest indicates.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:34):**  It's important also to take into account that fertility has been washed here because of  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:41):**  the rains, taken with the rains into the rivers and taken downstream, downriver, far away.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:48):**  The tropical soils are very fragile, they have evolved for thousands of years under  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:54):**  the shade of trees.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:15:56):**  The microbiology in that forest, in this forest sorry, it's very rich.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:04):**  So we have done a practice that is very good for restoring soils which is the capture and  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:10):**  reproduction of local microorganisms and that we use on a constant basis.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:17):**  Every month we apply by means of a pump, spraying to the plants and to the soil microbiology  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:25):**  constantly to try to bring back this memory of the forest into the plots that we are restoring  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:33):**  so that whenever there's a leaf that falls down, whenever there's an insect that dies,  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:38):**  that organic matter is quickly recycled.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:40):**  It's not lost, it's not volatized into the air.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:45):**  It's used on site and throughout the years also using manures fermented with water, with  
**[0:16:53-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:16:53):**  molasses, we have learned that first of all for many years people have become very you  
**[0:17:02-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:02):**  know kind of how to say, a little bit too relaxed or maybe just kind of comfortable  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:11):**  and have think about fertility as something they can buy in a store.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:16):**  Fertility that you buy in the store is derived from petrol and it's not really healthy for  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:22):**  the soil or for the plants or for whomever decides to eat what those plants produce.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:29):**  So we're trying to cut that and by using the local resources we see how we're putting a  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:35):**  lot of biomass, pruning the plants, putting them on the soil, putting the microorganisms  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:40):**  to transform that biomass into nutrients and to cycle with diversity, with associating  
**[0:17:47-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:47):**  species that help each other at the root levels, we've seen how the system has been transforming.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:17:54):**  We're here for nearly just over 10 years now, from pastures now to areas where you have  
**[0:18:01-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:01):**  25, 35 species in each plot at all different levels from grass and shrubs, from middle  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:11):**  high trees, some canopy trees and some are starting to grow above the canopy, some emerging  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:18):**  ones are popping up too.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:20):**  So it's been very rewarding over the years actually to see how this work, which is a  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:27):**  continuous work, you work with the rhythms of the succession and that's where analog  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:34):**  forestry is very efficient at.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:37):**  I can only imagine how much of a joy it must be to constantly watch this process evolve  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:42):**  and see how much the landscape has changed from pasture back into a lush forest.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:48):**  Now let's focus on the production farming aspect and where most of the income from the  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:55):**  farm is derived and that is the cacao.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:18:59):**  Now cacao and its derivative or its product as chocolate, as people kind of know it the  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:05):**  best, these days comes from a lot of different sources even though it is native to the Amazon  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:12):**  and to Central America.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:14):**  And you have opted to use a heritage variety specific to Ecuador.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:20):**  Can you tell me about how you have selected for the cacao Nacional from Ecuador and what  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:27):**  benefits it has for being reintroduced into this system in its native environment?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:32):**  Yes sure, first of all cacao is a biocultural heritage to Ecuador.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:39):**  There is some research, anthropological archaeological research that found remains of cacao in vessels  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:48):**  in an archaeological site in Southeast Ecuador in the Amazon that dates back to 5,000 years  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:54):**  ago.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:19:55):**  So the cacao has been around, we don't know exactly but there is a theory that says that  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:02):**  cross the Andes in southern Ecuador because the Andes are lower passes there in the south  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:07):**  only at 2,000 meters above sea level and so.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:11):**  So when the cacao crossed the Andes and spread into the Pacific it started to colonize and  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:18):**  be dispersed by humans into different microclimates.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:22):**  So that led to the evolution of different varieties of what we now call Nacional.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:29):**  The Nacional is well known worldwide because it's the most aromatic cacao and one of the  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:35):**  most flavorful.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:37):**  And the reason is because we are in the equator, we have the warm current from El Nino coming  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:44):**  from the Galapagos Islands, we have the cold current of Humboldt coming from Peru and Chile  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:51):**  in South America and we have the Andes with the volcanoes with a lot of good soils that  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:20:58):**  have fed through the watersheds, the foothills and the lowlands.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:03):**  So all this together makes it a very unique product of Ecuador.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:08):**  But although it has been very important in the history, in the creation of the Republic  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:13):**  of Ecuador, the money that made that possible actually came from the exports of cacao back  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:20):**  in the days.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:22):**  It is nowadays a bit worrying that a lot of the cacao Nacional is being replaced by hybrids  
**[0:21:30-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:30):**  because of the big industry demands because they want to plant more and more and more.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:39):**  Then the small scale farmers are pushed to change because they say that the cacao Nacional  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:47):**  produces less and so on, but we took that challenge and the opportunity then to prove  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:54):**  it the other way around.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:21:56):**  So when and how do we select?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:00):**  Well we go anytime of the year, we've gone to farms of small scale farmers wherein we  
**[0:22:08-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:08):**  have now our dog barking, sorry, we have looked into the varieties that we identify as Nacional  
**[0:22:20-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:20):**  and we have talked with farmers, we have secured some plant material and then we have brought  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:28):**  that here from our closest neighbors and we planted it the way that it used to be planted  
**[0:22:34-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:34):**  in the past in orchards that had many fruits, but in this case we are using the analog forestry  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:42):**  strategy to do it.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:44):**  With this it has proved very effective and now we have some data on productivity for  
**[0:22:49-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:49):**  instance and we know that our plots are producing more or less 575 kilos of dry seeds per hectare  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:22:58):**  per year, whereas the national mean of cacao is 300.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:04):**  So we have almost double the national mean and we are doing this in a province where  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:09):**  80% of the land that was dedicated to cacao Nacional has moved completely to monoculture  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:16):**  of hybrids.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:18):**  This is frightening because not only we are losing the cacao Nacional, its uniqueness,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:23):**  but also all the food sovereignty that comes along with the orchards of cacao.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:30):**  Just nowadays maybe you can say some farmers may be producing a little more cacao per se,  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:36):**  per parcel, but our data puts it the other way.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:40):**  Anyway, if they get more cacao then they have to sell cacao to buy bananas, to buy papayas,  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:47):**  to buy the rest of things that they used to have in their system.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:51):**  So this is where we are trying to put a big word out there that the cacao Nacional is  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:56):**  not only about cacao.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:23:57):**  It's about the rest, it's about the food, it's about the ecosystem services, water,  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:03):**  good soil, stability, biodiversity, and all in all a well-being for the farmers, for the  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:10):**  land, and for the consumers of the end products.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:14):**  Sure, just a generally more resilient model, not only for the landscape but for the businesses  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:20):**  and for the security of the people as well.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:23):**  Correct.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:24):**  Now tell me about the careful breeding process that the cacao Nacional requires in order  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:32):**  to preserve and continue to develop the genetics and how you promote genetic diversity in your  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:38):**  program.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:39):**  Very good one.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:40):**  Yes, well cacao Nacional is a tree that if you go to the jungle in the Amazon you're  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:46):**  going to find that it's under the shade of other trees.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:51):**  And when this happens, when you look at the ecology of the plant without human beings  
**[0:24:57-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:24:57):**  involved, you'll find that the cacao are visited by squirrels, by monkeys, by insects when  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:05):**  it's ripe.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:06):**  They debore through the out peel or the outer part of the fruit and then they eat part of  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:15):**  the pole which is very sweet, sometimes a bit of the seed but this one is bitter so  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:20):**  they discard and they left the pot on the ground.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:24):**  When the pot is on the ground, it collects water from the rain and because it's under  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:29):**  the shade it develops there the water collected there a right temperature, a route, acidity  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:36):**  and it comes there the minuscule fly that pollinates the flowers of cacao.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:42):**  It's a tiny fly.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:43):**  This fly cannot live on full sun.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:46):**  This fly cannot live where they put herbicides or pesticides, it dies.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:52):**  So the pollination of cacao is linked directly to a very small and sensitive insect.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:25:57):**  When this insect is thriving well, it can move around 30 meters or so from the area  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:05):**  where it's breeding in the cacao shells.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:08):**  So what we do is when we harvest here, we leave the pots in different places.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:14):**  We don't collect all the fruits and then take them to a cover area to open and process and  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:20):**  then have a big bulk of cacao pots or shells that we don't know where to put.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:26):**  We do it on site and at the same time bring back those nutrients to the soil, allowing  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:31):**  them to decompose there with the work of the microorganisms.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:35):**  So that's the stage one.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:36):**  Then when we selected the plants that we wanted to bring here, we selected a big diversity  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:41):**  of the varieties of the national because they told us, the neighbors here in the valley,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:46):**  that cacao does not grow well here.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:49):**  So we're looking for this diversity or in this diversity, maybe one, maybe two, maybe  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:56):**  more of varieties that would grow well here.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:26:59):**  In the end, all grow well, but at different times of the year.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:03):**  And what we are seeing now is that they are open pollination plants because they are not  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:09):**  such hybrids, of course, and this has led to very interesting that we now have seeds  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:15):**  that we are spreading to neighbors.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:17):**  They are planted and it has a stronger national genetic and that is already adapted to this  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:25):**  climate.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:26):**  So now we have a number of farms linked to the project and also very interestingly, having  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:33):**  good results with the production.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:35):**  That's fascinating and a really noble and important work for the bioheritage, like you  
**[0:27:40-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:40):**  said, of Ecuador and the history being preserved in this genetic information and continuing  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:49):**  to develop.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:50):**  I mean, this is some of the most important work of our time as production models are  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:27:55):**  increasingly kind of siphoning off the genetic diversity in these important crops.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:01):**  And micro breeders like yourselves are really kind of on the front lines of making sure  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:07):**  that some of the most important history of the diversity and the genetics of our natural  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:15):**  world are being preserved and get to continue their story.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:21):**  It's not just a matter of holding them in sort of a glass jar and looking at them from  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:25):**  a distance, but letting them express their full potential as life and continuing to evolve  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:33):**  in these processes that are so necessary in adaptation to changes in climate, changes  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:40):**  in microclimate and continuing to spread to other parts of the country and to the world  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:46):**  and recolonize those areas where they've now been abandoned.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:50):**  Now what other crops do you grow in your agroforestry system?  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:28:55):**  You've talked so much about all of the diversity that you promote, and I know that cacao certainly  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:01):**  is not the only one, but you've also moved away from some of those sun loving initial  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:05):**  plants that helped to get the system restarted.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:09):**  Can you talk about the plants that create sort of symbiotic relationships with the larger  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:14):**  system?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:15):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:16):**  Well, the number of species, I kind of lost track already, but it's about 250 species  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:23):**  planted in five plots that we have, well, no, now we have eight plots, sorry.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:29):**  And it keeps adding up.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:32):**  We're very lucky to be in the tropics where many things grow.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:36):**  We're also doing a great deal of work in trying to bring back some crops that have been forgotten,  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:44):**  we call the ancestral crops.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:45):**  For instance, we have some roots that their use date back to 9,000 years ago in the Pacific  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:53):**  of Ecuador.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:54):**  And these are what we call yeren.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:29:57):**  Yeren are relative of what people know as peliconias, nice tropical flowers that are  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:05):**  visited by hummingbirds, sometimes confused with birds of paradise.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:11):**  So we have plants like that.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:13):**  We have plants that are also vines.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:16):**  We plant a lot of vines.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:18):**  So we use also the plants that are already standing there as our support species for  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:23):**  the vines.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:24):**  And we have, for instance, here in the foothills where it's too hot and you cannot grow potatoes  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:30):**  because potatoes like it cold and are more of the Andes.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:34):**  But we have our potatoes.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:35):**  We have a vine that produces a tuber up in the branches that when it's ready, it just  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:42):**  very gentle.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:44):**  It would let it loose and you pick from the ground.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:47):**  You can boil and eat as potatoes.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:50):**  We have other more well known ginger.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:54):**  We have also what you call turmeric.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:30:58):**  We call different here.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:01):**  We have a great diversity of relatives of cacao.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:06):**  We have nine different cacao relatives of the same genus that can be used for the pulp  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:12):**  that you can drink as used.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:14):**  One famous from Brazil called cupuazu, which is kind of now known and kind of in vogue  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:20):**  as a superfood.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:22):**  And it's interesting that we talk about superfoods because all the food that is grown healthy  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:28):**  without chemicals is a superfood to me.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:32):**  In a way, we also have here a lot of other trees.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:36):**  We have the tree that is related to cacao but comes from Africa.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:40):**  The kola tree from which the original recipe of kola or coca-cola came from.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:48):**  We have here ice cream bean trees that are very interesting.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:52):**  We call wava.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:31:53):**  These are on the family of beans and they have large pots with very nice texture, pulp,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:02):**  whitish and soft and sweet.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:05):**  This, talking about how the plants help each other, is one of the most helpful plants because  
**[0:32:11-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:11):**  as all legumes on its root system, it has a symbiotic relationship with the bacterias.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:20):**  And we have here that, for instance, in the roots of the legumes, there is nitrogen-fixing  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:26):**  bacterias that anchor into small pockets that we call nodules, are like little apartments,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:33):**  little houses where they live.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:35):**  And then the plant gives it a place where to live and in turn the bacteria feeds the  
**[0:32:40-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:40):**  plant by providing and capturing the atmospheric nitrogen and make it available for the plants.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:47):**  Understanding that this element is more or less like fuel for the plants.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:51):**  So they need this, it's vital for the growth and that way these plants can grow happily,  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:32:58):**  produce a lot of leaves, a lot of branches, a lot of flowers, fruits and all of these  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:03):**  that you can constantly prune are put back into the soil to form again a rich and loose  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:09):**  soil that is very fertile.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:11):**  This is just to give you a few examples.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:13):**  As I said, we have a good big list of fruiting trees but we concentrate not only on fruit  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:22):**  but also like to look at the wide range of possibilities.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:26):**  So some are timber trees that we are going to have to use because we believe in bioconstruction.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:33):**  We have also from the same area we can get nuts, we can get medicine and so there's a  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:42):**  whole lot of spices that we have, pepper, vanilla.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:47):**  We have a good diversity to keep well entertained through our lives I think.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:53):**  This is amazing, it's a perfect example of how if you take care of the abundance of the  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:33:57):**  ecosystem in which you live, it will take care of you and then some.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:02):**  The abundance that's coming out of the biodiversity and the sort of stacked layers and the care  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:10):**  that you've put into each one of those layers, just like you've mentioned, has given you  
**[0:34:15-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:15):**  everything from an economy to food to medicine to beauty and everything else that one could  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:23):**  really want to have an enriching life and it comes from understanding and taking care  
**[0:34:30-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:30):**  of the resources that you have at your disposal in your area and not putting human desires  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:38):**  beyond the needs of the ecosystem and the health that's created for all different forms  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:44):**  of life there, not just focusing on your own.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:47):**  Correct, very important indeed.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:50):**  So let's talk about the business aspect of this because at the end of the day you have  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:34:54):**  to find a way to get these products that you mentioned out to market and when there's too  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:00):**  much diversity you can't really focus on anything well enough to scale it up to production but  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:06):**  you've done a great job about kind of keeping this in house.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:10):**  So tell me about the process of creating small batch artisan chocolate at your workshop on  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:16):**  the site.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:17):**  Yes, well it's very important first of all to say why we are doing the chocolate itself  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:26):**  is because when we came here we established not to produce chocolate, we established to  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:32):**  have a small reserve to protect one of the most threatened habitats in Ecuador that is  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:38):**  part of a bio region called the, it's funny, it's called the choco almost as chocolate  
**[0:35:44-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:44):**  but it's just called choco and this area has suffered over the years from extensive deforestation  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:52):**  and mostly the lowlands because they want to plant more bananas and hard to farm and  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:35:57):**  large extensive industrial monocultures.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:01):**  So we established a reserve with the aim of protecting but we saw that there were some  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:06):**  areas that were intervene and we saw that what was causing this situation was the model  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:12):**  around us that many people are doing just one thing at a time.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:16):**  When you do a polyculture yes some people wonders then how are you going to scale it  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:22):**  up how you're going to do it and we decided to in the very beginning we were naive enough  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:28):**  to think that if we sell the seeds we were going to get enough from the cacao beans to  
**[0:36:33-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:33):**  run the reserve but we found out that there was a big problem there which was the middleman  
**[0:36:41-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:41):**  and the middleman in cacao in Ecuador it's whom is keeping the most and it's not really  
**[0:36:49-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:49):**  helping at all so we said how can we do to to serve us to to be able to to go beyond  
**[0:36:59-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:36:59):**  and then it was that we had the idea to start an artisanal worship on site here in the reserve  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:37:07):**  and next to the plots where the cacao grows and we are pioneers as far as we know in transforming  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:37:14):**  the beans on site right next door to the restoration plots and over the years it has been a big  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:37:21):**  challenge too because we need to establish infrastructure we need to have enough power  
**[0:37:27-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:37:27):**  to be able to run the machines the machines are a big challenge itself because historically  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:37:35):**  is all being produced in large scale so we have to create more or less our own small  
**[0:37:40-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:37:40):**  scale artisan machines over the last 10 years Ecuador has been experiencing what we call  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:37:47):**  now the chocolate boom there has been some cacao boom areas in the past now we are moving  
**[0:37:53-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:37:53):**  to a big different reality and here on the farm we practice we did all sort of different  
**[0:38:01-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:01):**  trails until at the end we came to more or less eight years ago seven years ago to the  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:09):**  final product we have now which is actually a number of products derived from cacao and  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:14):**  interestingly if you have cacao alone you can create chocolate bars you can create cacao  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:21):**  butter you can create cocoa or cacao powder but then that's it maybe yes you can have  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:27):**  chocolate bars in different percentages that are it's kind of trending now like say 65  
**[0:38:32-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:32):**  percent pure cacao or 80 percent pure cacao and so on but in the analog forest and in  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:40):**  the food forest systems that we've been able to establish we have more potential because  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:45):**  we have all the other companion species and so with the same cacao we are now producing  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:51):**  15 different products because we are adding with the chocolate some of the fruits some  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:38:59):**  of the spices and some of the nuts from the species that are growing together with the  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:39:06):**  cacao in the restoration plots and I think that has been one of the the key things that  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:39:12):**  we didn't design to start with but that in the in the trail we learned about that if  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:39:20):**  you play in favor of diversity, diversity pays back not only monetarily speaking but  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:39:27):**  as you were saying earlier it's just the joy of seeing all of this happening and feeling  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:39:32):**  really grateful that it's actually taking place and that you can see that it's such  
**[0:39:36-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:39:36):**  a beneficial system overall for all the beings involved from microorganisms to final end  
**[0:39:47-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:39:47):**  consumer so it's been a hard work and it's been at the same time very rewarding.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:39:55):**  Certainly and it seems to me that one of the big advantages that a smaller operation that's  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:01):**  diversified and really invested in the ecosystem the way yours has may not be able to perhaps  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:07):**  compete with larger producers on quantity of scale and low prices that come from that  
**[0:40:14-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:14):**  but where you can compete is on high quality very very healthy products and the other things  
**[0:40:22-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:22):**  that you're able to do such as cutting out waste or any unnecessary plastic in the packaging  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:29):**  and sort of the ethics of how you do business that can create a niche in the market for  
**[0:40:33-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:33):**  loyal and dedicated customers so that even though you're not selling at massive scale  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:40):**  you can still you know invest in the community invest in your workers and reinvest in the  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:46):**  projects that are creating a resilience in the ecology as well as the economy of what  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:51):**  you're doing isn't that right?  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:40:53):**  Business is I think it's a keystone to start by changing the way we conceive things in  
**[0:41:00-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:00):**  life for instance we have it clear that we are not here for competition we don't want  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:07):**  to take over the market we don't want to grow endless because what we have as a legacy from  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:14):**  others that have done that is in terms of how we see it is negative for the environment  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:21):**  is negative for you don't share we want to have many more small scale projects like this  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:27):**  we don't want this to be the only one we want the diversity to express but healthy we don't  
**[0:41:33-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:33):**  want the corporations to have all the saying about what the cost consumers should or should  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:41):**  not eat I think it's a big moment nowadays that we experience in this crisis to actually  
**[0:41:47-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:47):**  take the time to do a deep thinking about it how we as consumers we all consume something  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:41:55):**  and make a big difference when we select what we want to eat what we want to put inside  
**[0:42:00-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:00):**  our bodies because there was a big saying many many years back by one of the big thinkers  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:08):**  from the Roman times and it's considered the father of the of medicine and Hippocrates  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:15):**  he said let the food be your medicine and let the medicine be your food many people  
**[0:42:21-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:21):**  nowadays is concerned because of the health and how this affecting overall all of our  
**[0:42:29-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:29):**  daily activities and the situation we are living but it's also important to see that  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:36):**  nowadays the majority is putting a lot of attention in food because food is what is  
**[0:42:42-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:42):**  going to give us a good health not only you know feeling physically well but mental also  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:50):**  is very important the more nutritious the food that we eat the more minerals then the  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:42:55):**  better the brain can work and the rest of our organs do it's like doing an analogy if  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:01):**  you want to do things good out there then things are going to be working well inside  
**[0:43:06-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:06):**  also. Yeah it is much of a more holistic way of looking at every aspect of the business  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:14):**  the ecology your own well-being investments in the community and every aspect is considered  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:20):**  as a part of a whole rather than a separate portion that needs to be focused on and optimized  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:26):**  the way so much of our businesses and production models are focused on right now and with that  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:32):**  in mind Alejandro how can people get in touch and learn more about your farm and your cacao  
**[0:43:37-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:37):**  products? Well as of now because of the situation we can say that you can look at our website  
**[0:43:48-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:48):**  we have a website called Choco Mashpi C-H-O-C-O and then mashpi is the name of the valley  
**[0:43:56-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:43:56):**  where we are the river M-A-S-H-P-I and at that page you can see the products that we  
**[0:44:05-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:05):**  have we also have a Facebook mashpi artisanal chocolate you can find us and follow us there  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:11):**  we are putting videos there about the daily activities we are always expressing the love  
**[0:44:17-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:17):**  we have for diversity and the respect we have for the cycles of nature we are constantly  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:24):**  letting people know not just about the products but everything that comes together with it  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:29):**  and those two channels are very important and we'll be sharing also contact for those  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:35):**  who are interested in the products in the US also we have now established a good collaboration  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:41):**  there and some of the products are already there starting to be distributed and in the  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:47):**  future times we would like to have you come visit over the years we have had held here  
**[0:44:54-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:44:54):**  workshops tourist visits to our facilities farm and chocolate farm tours were very useful  
**[0:45:04-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alejandro-solano/#t=0:45:04):**  for us as well as an environmental education tool also helping the most direct of commerce

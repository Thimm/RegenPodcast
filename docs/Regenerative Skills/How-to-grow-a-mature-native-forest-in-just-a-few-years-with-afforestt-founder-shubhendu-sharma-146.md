**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:19):**  over the world now with your reforestation projects, but before we get into some of the  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:23):**  work that you've done, how about you tell our listeners a little bit about your background  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:27):**  and what first inspired you and your interest in forestry?  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:32):**  Alright, so I, though I studied industrial engineering in college, which I always wanted  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:37):**  to do, it was purely out of passion.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:40):**  I really loved machines, really loved factories and how things are made.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:46):**  I ended up becoming an engineer and Toyota was one of my dream companies to work for  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:53):**  and I eventually ended up working at Toyota.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:03:56):**  One year after I finished my engineering and there while working at Toyota I was exposed  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:03):**  to a scientist, Dr. Akira Miyawaki, who is an expert in afforestation.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:10):**  He is a Japanese scientist from Yokohama National University.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:13):**  He's a professor, emeritus there.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:16):**  And with Dr. Miyawaki Toyota made a small forest in 2009 and I was so fascinated just  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:23):**  by looking at the pictures of his work in his first presentation that I joined his team  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:30):**  as a volunteer, learned the methodology and just like any other Toyota engineer I wrote  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:35):**  a standard operating procedures, SOP, how to make a forest.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:39):**  Using that SOP I made a forest on my own and that's how I got interested in afforestation  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:46):**  and started practicing.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:48):**  So tell me about how you sort of implemented your first forest.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:52):**  It was in your backyard at your home, wasn't it?  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:55):**  Yes.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:04:56):**  So implementation of first forest happened under the supervision of Dr. Miyawaki in the  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:01):**  factory where I was working.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:03):**  And one and a half years from then, like I used that one and a half years to see the  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:08):**  growth of the forest, study a lot more and write all those manuals, which would help  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:14):**  me make a forest all by myself.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:16):**  So the house forest was actually the second forest I became a part of, but it was the  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:24):**  first forest which I made all by myself.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:27):**  That's why we made a lot of mistakes in making and planting that forest.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:31):**  But the base of that entire process was based on what I learned at Toyota when Dr. Miyawaki  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:40):**  was making his first forest in India.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:43):**  All right, so let's talk a little bit about the Miyawaki method of growing trees and how  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:48):**  it's different from the way a lot of organizations and companies go about trying to plant trees  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:53):**  or reforest an area.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:05:56):**  So the basic theory on which Miyawaki method works is called the theory of potential natural  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:06:03):**  vegetation, PNV.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:06:05):**  The theory says that if a piece of land is deprived from human intervention, naturally  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:06:11):**  a forest will come back on it.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:06:13):**  The first grasses will come, then small shrubs, then trees, which are pioneer species, soft  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:06:22):**  wood, fast growing trees.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:06:24):**  And then eventually trees which are slow growing like oak, they will start to appear and make  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:06:32):**  a system which will keep on regenerating itself.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:06:36):**  That ecology won't change until probably the next ice age.

**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:09:37):**  you're doing the project.

**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:09:54):**  sub trees or small trees, then trees and then canopy.

**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:20:43):**  So if one particular species grows as a big tree somewhere else, it may become a shrub

**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:21:02):**  So we cannot categorize like one size fits all for all the places.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:21:08):**  But to give you a generic idea, in deserted places up to 70% could be shrubs and just

**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:21:35):**  Instead of a forest, we call it a wooded grassland.

**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:21:43):**  we are in process of bringing back the vegetation which would have existed on that particular

**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:22:33):**  For canopy, I've seen variation of like 15% to 1%.

**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:17):**  We planted our first forest in that extremely degraded soil using the jeev amrit.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:21):**  Luckily, we found a supplier in that area who was practicing making of the jeev amrit  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:27):**  for a few years.

**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:40):**  specific type of cow.

**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:44):**  The cow which was native to that particular geography.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:50):**  That was the key to make the jeev amrit.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:52):**  And it made a lot of sense when we realized when we studied the science behind how jeev  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:57):**  amrit works.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:28:58):**  So this is a small example Dr. Palekar shared with us.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:02):**  He said, when you go to a field, and if you see cow dung fallen on the ground, if it is

**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:22):**  holes under it.

**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:26):**  And I remember yes, there are holes under the cow dung if it has fallen on the grazing  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:32):**  land, wherever it is, or even in wildlife, in the wild, if you see animal poop, you just  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:38):**  remove it.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:39):**  And you see there are holes under it.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:44):**  And the reason why these holes are there is because once the dung falls on the ground,  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:48):**  the earthworms living under the soil gets attracted towards it, and they start moving  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:29:55):**  towards the higher soil so that they can reach the top level.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:00):**  And while doing this, they're digesting the soil from deeper levels and releasing the  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:06):**  soil as excreta at the higher levels.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:10):**  And if you move in the soil deeper, you will realize that you will find that the mineral  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:15):**  content is higher in the deeper soils compared to the top soil.

**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:27):**  the earthworm is bringing that deeper soils to the top means he's increasing the minerals  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:34):**  in the soil.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:36):**  And on the surface, the dung beetles will get attracted towards this dung, make balls  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:41):**  of it and take it to their burrows.

**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:30:51):**  and distributing it all over the area.

**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:31:00):**  the earthworms, you have teamed up with the beetles, just by introducing a little bit  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:31:04):**  of animal poop to your forest area.

**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:31:39):**  need nitrogen to grow.

**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:34:37):**  We just ask our lab to give us comments.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:34:40):**  We ask them just tell us whether it is very less, less, medium, normal or high.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:34:48):**  Based on that we have developed a table where we can tell how many kilograms of manure we

**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:35:11):**  Then we have organic carbon.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:35:13):**  Organic carbon if it is less, we may add some biomass, some native local biomass available

**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:35:36):**  they start shedding their own leaves, adding carbon back to the soil.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:35:40):**  Then we add some material which can loosen up the soil naturally.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:35:45):**  So our test is we do a soil texture test like whether it's sand, silt, clay, loam or type  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:35:53):**  of loam, type of sand, type of clay.

**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:35:58):**  We make a bowl of soil and make tapes.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:01):**  You can find it on internet anywhere how to check the texture of soil.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:05):**  And then we have developed a list which a table where you can find out if your soil  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:13):**  is one type, let's say if your soil is clay, the table will tell you it has low perforation  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:18):**  capacity which means when you pour water on the soil, the water will not seep in.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:23):**  It won't go in.

**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:28):**  which can make it porous enough so that when you pour water on the soil, it can go in because  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:34):**  plants would need that moisture eventually.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:38):**  So we add some biomass which is crunchy in nature like husk of a patty, of rice.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:48):**  Now it's very crunchy in nature.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:49):**  It has a spring action means when you crush it in your fist, it will come back to its  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:36:55):**  original shape.

**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:37:06):**  And this soil can get water seep through.

**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:37:31):**  But sand doesn't have the capacity to hold water and your plants need that moisture which  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:37:37):**  exists in the soil of a healthy natural forest.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:37:40):**  So how to make sure that your sandy soil can still retain some moisture in it, mix some  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:37:45):**  biomass, which is spongy in nature and can absorb water like a sponge.

**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:16):**  Because what was happening was that everybody was planting ornamental trees and paying the  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:19):**  top buck for it, but nobody really cared about the native trees.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:23):**  And even if they wanted to plant, they were not as lucrative as money making as the exotic  
**[0:49:30-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:30):**  species.

**[0:49:37-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:37):**  So the challenge today is how do we create a backbone, a supply chain for all these native  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:44):**  trees?

**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:51):**  They won't have the supply chain of their native trees.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:54):**  Once they go to a forest, they do a survey, they will make a list of native trees.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:49:58):**  They won't be able to buy all of them because of low supply available.

**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:05):**  It was there when we made our first forest.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:07):**  It's there, it's still there when we are making our 150 first forest.

**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:29):**  of greening with using of native trees.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:33):**  Even if we are planting one tree, we should be planting a native tree.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:37):**  So that's one of the challenge.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:39):**  Second challenge was as a company we faced that nobody was getting paid to plant trees  
**[0:50:45-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:45):**  and claiming ourselves to be the professional forest makers and delivering our services,  
**[0:50:52-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:52):**  getting paid for it was a challenge.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:50:55):**  It was a mindset shift which we had to wait for to occur.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:01):**  So we had to compete with the idea that you are planting trees, it's great, but it's government's  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:10):**  job, it's job of non-profit organizations.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:12):**  Why should I pay you if I can get it done for free?  
**[0:51:16-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:16):**  So that was, you know, I think first four to five years we struggled with that and luckily  
**[0:51:25-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:25):**  I got an opportunity to speak at TED where I could speak to, where we developed enough  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:31):**  credibility that we could place ourselves as professionals who should get paid for their

**[0:51:42-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:42):**  And third challenge I would say is acceptance of having a forest in your backyard.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:50):**  Because in India most of the people are worried of snakes.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:51:53):**  They say if I plant a forest in my house, if I planted it in my corporate campus, there

**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:52:15):**  And now we are in a position, so we had to repackage our entire contractual service.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:52:22):**  Now it's a huge success, we call it forestcaping, where we integrated art, design and forest.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:52:29):**  We coined this term forestcaping, got the domain as well and registered it as a trademark.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:52:37):**  So now what we are doing is we are providing forestcaping services where we will bring

**[0:53:04-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:53:04):**  And then we will plant a forest which would be a dense forest in two to three years where  
**[0:53:10-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:53:10):**  they will have an amphitheater and a sitting space.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:53:13):**  So we kind of create those experiences where forests will attract people.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:53:18):**  There would be, people would be sitting in the amphitheater and there would be a show

**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:53:34):**  Meetings were happening inside the forest and nobody was worried about snakes.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:53:38):**  It was everyday life.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:53:39):**  It was so normal.

**[0:58:29-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:58:29):**  I'm like, should I do it now?

**[0:58:43-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=0:58:43):**  in getting projects like this started is the lack of access to the native species that

**[1:00:40-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:00:40):**  But I want to keep doing as many as possible of them.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:00:45):**  So what they get to learn is especially the one which we do in February every year, which  
**[1:00:50-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:00:50):**  is happening from 21st of this month in India, in central India, we take the team to a natural

**[1:00:59-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:00:59):**  So they get to see a natural forest, they get to learn how to do a survey and also collect  
**[1:01:05-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:05):**  the seeds from these surveys.

**[1:01:13-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:13):**  the seeds, going to a nursery, maybe do a little bit of hands on and how to plant the  
**[1:01:19-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:19):**  seeds in the bags to grow seedlings.

**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:27):**  So it's purely hands on, you know, they have to touch the cow dung, they have to touch  
**[1:01:31-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:31):**  the cow urine, they have to collect the soil and it gets messy and it's something which,  
**[1:01:38-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:38):**  you know, you have to break the mold, you know, if you really want to get your hands  
**[1:01:42-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:42):**  dirty, if you really want to learn how to make a forest, we want you to touch the soil,  
**[1:01:47-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:47):**  eat, breathe, sleep in the soil for at least those seven days.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:51):**  So that, you know, it becomes, you become part of the forest altogether, literally.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:01:57):**  So we will be making those jeeva amrit, we'll be working in the soil, digging the soil,  
**[1:02:03-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:03):**  mixing the materials in the soil, planting trees, we will be literally planting 300 trees  
**[1:02:09-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:09):**  by maybe 10 participants.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:12):**  So everybody would be planting at least 10 to 15 trees and then we will have some help.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:17):**  We will be mulching, like we will be making a complete forest and at the same time you  
**[1:02:22-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:22):**  will be able to see the forest which we planted last year with the last batch.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:26):**  So you will also be able to appreciate within a year's time how your forest is going to  
**[1:02:32-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:32):**  look like.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:33):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[1:02:38-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:02:38):**  workshop at a particular place for the last three years.

**[1:03:30-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-grow-a-healthy-native-forest-in-record-time-with-afforestt-founder-shubhendu-sharma-146/#t=1:03:30):**  sharp professional forest making experience.

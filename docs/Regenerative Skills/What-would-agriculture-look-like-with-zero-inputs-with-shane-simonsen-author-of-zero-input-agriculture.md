**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:02:54):**  that I've come across in a long time and asked the simple question of how might we still

**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:04:28):**  Spain's finally starting to ease out of the Estado de Alarama.

**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:04:38):**  How is that transition on your homestead going?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:04:42):**  This is the busiest time of year.

**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:04:47):**  So that's when I do most of my planting and establishing because I don't use any irrigation.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:04:53):**  So I basically have to rely on the weather and the groundwater to do the job for me.

**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:05:15):**  When I was a kid, I was your typical biology and plant nerd.

**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:05:26):**  And I was planning on doing botany, but I was friends with a botanical taxonomist at  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:05:31):**  the time who recommended that I do chemistry instead because it's more employable.

**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:05:44):**  chemistry.

**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:05:48):**  Did field work all over Australia collecting plants and did all sorts of hair raising chemistry.

**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:05:54):**  And I segued into an academic career, started it off and I just wasn't feeling it.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:01):**  I was actually, I was living in Canberra, our capital where it's like cold and dry.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:06):**  And I was spending my weekends running a small gardening business and having a huge garden  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:10):**  in my rental, even though it was insecure.

**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:17):**  Just looking at beakers stirring wasn't that exciting.

**[0:06:25-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:25):**  I left just before the global financial crisis and bought a 40 acre Sunshine Coast Interland,

**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:42):**  how I fill my days now.

**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:50):**  seeing around you.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:52):**  Was that also kind of motivated by what you had been studying?  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:06:56):**  Did that kind of determine what you were looking for as far as land and possibilities for growing  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:01):**  seasons?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:05):**  Like most things in life, it was just a series of kind of fortunate events that we ended  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:09):**  up with this particular chunk of land.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:12):**  And we were kind of fortunate to get it at a kind of non-bubble price.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:16):**  Anyway, I won't get into the conditions of how we were lucky enough to get it.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:21):**  But I grew up in the subtropics, so I'm more familiar with how to grow here and my family's  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:28):**  here.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:29):**  So I think it was just mostly those circumstances.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:31):**  But I have been peak oil aware since about 2000.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:35):**  And yeah, things were getting quite hairy in the run up to the global financial crisis.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:39):**  So I think that was the final push I needed to get out of the cities and run for the hills.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:44):**  And that time things turned around.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:47):**  I was open minded about where it was all going to go.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:49):**  And same this time around with whatever's coming down the line at us.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:07:53):**  It looks bad, but a lot of people were saying it was instant Armageddon 12 years ago and  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:01):**  things kept staggering along.

**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:06):**  Well, so I've been fascinated by what I've been reading on your blog on zero input agriculture.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:13):**  And it seems like one of your motivations is something that you write about, about how  
**[0:08:18-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:18):**  humans can go from this category that you call us as a universal parasite to a universal  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:25):**  symbiont.

**[0:08:33-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:33):**  planet and what it would mean or what it would look like if humanity became a universal symbiont?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:41):**  You actually read that article.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:42):**  I'm so chuffed.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:44):**  So yeah, I'm very interested in human origins and all of our deep history.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:50):**  And in relationships between species, they often start out as predatory.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:08:57):**  One animal will just completely eat the other.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:00):**  Over time that can develop into something that's a little bit less cut and dried.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:06):**  It'll become parasitic as the organism learns to exploit that resource without completely  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:10):**  destroying it.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:11):**  And I look at humans as going through a similar kind of transition that early humans were  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:17):**  just the ultimate hunting machine.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:19):**  They traveled all over the planet and ate pretty much every animal that they could cross  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:22):**  paths with, driving many of them to extinction and crashing ecosystems along the way.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:29):**  Eventually that had to stop and domestication happened, both with plants and with animals.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:34):**  And we've become a bit more parasitic with the way that we interact with those organisms.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:38):**  You could argue we're exploiting them to their detriment.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:42):**  But over time, those relationships in biology tend to become more symbiotic.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:46):**  We're both parties.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:48):**  Both species are interacting to mutual benefit.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:50):**  And I think humans have that ability because we can interact with almost any other species  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:09:56):**  on the planet because we're so behaviorally flexible.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:00):**  And so it's just a matter of determining what our future with our interactions with this  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:04):**  planet are going to look like.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:06):**  And if we continue to extract these resources to their detriment or if we can find sort  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:12):**  of a symbiotic way of helping them to increase while still utilizing them.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:18):**  Is that right?  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:19):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:22):**  You could see humans as potentially a universal keystone species where the whole ecosystem  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:27):**  kind of cascades out from us.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:29):**  But I mean, it's still early days, 10,000 years, 100,000 years.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:32):**  That's a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:35):**  So we're still invasive species are the same.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:38):**  Like when they first appear in an environment, they often kind of run amok and get completely  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:43):**  out of balance.

**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:50):**  and things kind of fall into place.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:10:53):**  Well, so that leads us to zero input farming and kind of the dedication of your blog and

**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:11:15):**  I mean, we've been doing it for 10,000 years or so.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:11:18):**  It's only in the last couple of hundred years that we've become addicted to fossil fuels

**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:17:35):**  and growing particular things for a long time to start getting an idea of what grows well.

**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:17:45):**  on for myself, you very quickly find microclimates even within a small area that could support

**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:13):**  And we've got like four of them right around us.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:16):**  You can actually see them from the farm.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:18):**  They're beautiful.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:19):**  But the problem with that is you dig a hole and it's like, oh, that looks a particular  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:22):**  texture and color.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:24):**  And you walk 10 meters and dig another hole and it's completely different.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:28):**  So in some ways that's really great because it expands the range of plants that we can  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:32):**  grow here.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:33):**  But the flip side is you've got to find the right soil that they actually want to grow  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:36):**  in.

**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:43):**  out when they're really small or direct seed, even better.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:47):**  And that allows me to just experiment all over the place.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:50):**  And if things die, it's not a big deal.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:52):**  Mark Shepherd, I think, takes a very similar approach.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:54):**  He's been a big inspiration to me.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:18:57):**  And I think it's like his stun method of planting trees.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:19:00):**  Sheer total other neglect.

**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:19:16):**  and selecting for hardiness because of the severity of the cold in his area of Wisconsin,

**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:19:24):**  Yeah, no, absolutely.

**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:33:51):**  around here and occasionally they'll eat it, but people mostly just say you can eat it

**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:34:01):**  A staple crop should be so vigorous that you don't have to really stress to keep it alive

**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:34:07):**  The problem with it though is it's just a single clone.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:34:11):**  And if you know anything about the Irish potato famine, that should make you nervous about

**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:34:37):**  more interesting with it?

**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:34:45):**  and managed to find someone in the UK who'd done field work to South America and had these  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:34:50):**  really weird varieties, including one that turned out to probably be the ancestral species  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:34:55):**  for the domesticated forms because it's got really large tubers as well.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:34:59):**  Grows like three meters tall.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:01):**  It's amazing.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:02):**  So the question was, is the Queensland arrowroot actually fertile?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:06):**  Can it produce any seeds or is there something like broken about its genetics?  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:10):**  So I had to go through multiple years of figuring out, can I store the pollen?  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:15):**  Cause they floured at different times of the year.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:18):**  Turns out I couldn't after a lot of home lab experiments to figure that out.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:23):**  But I eventually figured out if you cut back the that wild species halfway through its  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:28):**  growing system, a season, it delays its flowering.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:32):**  So that lines up with the Queensland arrowroot and you can do direct hand pollination.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:36):**  And it's funny, they're bird pollinated flowers.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:39):**  And when I say hand pollination, I actually mean I use my hands.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:41):**  I go around and get pollen on my fingers and little piles.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:45):**  And then I go to the other plants and apply the pollen.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:48):**  And I'm now growing out the third generation, second generation of hybrids.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:35:55):**  And for anyone interested that's listening, I have spare seed from those early breeding  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:00):**  program that I just sent to anyone in the world for the price of postage.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:04):**  Because that early diversity, I'll be refining it for my conditions, but it could be refined  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:09):**  in other directions as well.

**[0:36:14-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:14):**  That's fantastic.

**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:20):**  to propagate it could result in some really fantastic things.

**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:33):**  So we've got a local conifer tree called a bunya nut.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:38):**  I don't know if you've heard about it.

**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:46):**  row in Antigua Guatemala.

**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:36:53):**  I can't remember what time of year it was now.

**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:37:36):**  nut and a chestnut.

**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:37:47):**  And it's like, how long have I got left on the clock?

**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:37:56):**  Who else would have the space and the security of the land and the time and the interest

**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:07):**  So I went out when we had a really bumpy year.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:09):**  They're a masting species like a lot of the oaks are.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:12):**  You get some years that they just produce way more kinds than normal.

**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:33):**  they were.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:34):**  I was suspecting going out that they'd all look the same, but they're actually really  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:37):**  diverse.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:39):**  So they're now growing out.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:40):**  I was just planting out a whole lot of seedlings this rainy season and they're looking okay.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:44):**  And you're planting them from that nut inside of the comb?  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:47):**  Yes.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:48):**  So I've tried direct sowing.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:50):**  My soil isn't quite up to it.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:52):**  So when you start them in a pot, they've got this peculiar germination where they put out  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:55):**  a tuber first and they hide underground for a while.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:38:59):**  It might be an adaptation for fire, but they're not a particularly fire tolerant species.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:03):**  So it's a bit of a mystery what that's all.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:04):**  You can eat that little tuber as well if you want.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:06):**  It's kind of like parsnip.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:08):**  And then later they put up a spike.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:10):**  So I grew them out in pots, got them up to a reasonable size and then put them out and  
**[0:39:15-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:15):**  they're looking pretty happy now.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:16):**  So now I just have to wait for 15 odd years.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:21):**  Now the long wait.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:23):**  Yes.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:24):**  The interesting thing is that this is the really key part though.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:27):**  So when a species of plants, well maybe animals even, but mostly plants get domesticated,  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:33):**  they usually go through a hybridization event.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:36):**  So if you look into the origin of pretty much any crop that humans have, it actually started  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:40):**  as a group of at least two separate wild species that cross fertilize.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:45):**  And from that hybrid population, all that genetic diversity, you can pick out something  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:49):**  that works for people.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:51):**  And it's really amazing looking back at this common pattern.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:54):**  In fact it happened for humans.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:55):**  I mean we hybridized with Neanderthals and other things along the way.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:39:59):**  So it's a very common pattern in nature.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:03):**  A really salient example is the macadamia nuts that also comes from just up the road  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:07):**  from me where the wild species grow.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:09):**  There was a tree collector who got two of those wild species and crossed them just out  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:13):**  of interest or maybe accidentally.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:16):**  And the whole macadamia industry that we have today is based on that one chance cross that  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:20):**  someone decided to put these two wild species together and see what happens.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:23):**  Yeah it's crazy.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:24):**  That's another one that's massive in Guatemala.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:28):**  A lot of weed species in the world are like that as well.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:31):**  So lentana, that's a major weed in Australia.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:34):**  It's actually a three-way hybrid of three ornamental species that are perfectly well-behaved  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:38):**  on their own.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:39):**  And when all of that magic got put together, boom, it's like the sorcerer's apprentice.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:46):**  So anyway getting back to the bunion nuts, I'm like okay so we've got a bit of genetic  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:49):**  diversity here and I could probably do something with it but can I do a hybridization?  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:53):**  So I looked around and it's a gondwanan species.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:40:56):**  So they're also in South America and it turns out there's another species in southern Brazil  
**[0:41:01-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:01):**  which has a very similar climate to us called the parana pine.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:04):**  Not like the biting fish, it's all a P-A-R-A-N-A.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:08):**  And it also produces large edible nuts that the indigenous people have eaten there for  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:13):**  thousands of years.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:14):**  And I've managed to get my hands on some of those.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:17):**  I've imported them following all the procedures and they're now growing in amongst my bunion  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:22):**  grove.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:23):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:24):**  And how long do you have to wait to see if that's working?  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:28):**  They're faster growing by the look of them but a little bit slower to mature.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:32):**  So again they should be flowering around about the same time as the bunions.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:35):**  The really amazing thing though, and I do know hybrids can occur between those species,  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:39):**  they have them growing in Kew Gardens in the UK.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:42):**  So I'm not going to wait 15 years and then find out they're not compatible.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:45):**  But the really amazing thing is unlike the bunion nuts, the parana pines have separate  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:50):**  male and female trees.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:52):**  Some plants do.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:54):**  So it's going to break my heart but when those parana pines start maturing, the males are  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:41:58):**  going to have to get culled.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:42:01):**  So the remaining females, when they produce seeds, they have to be hybrids with the bunions.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:42:08):**  And the plan is to send those seeds all over the planet basically.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:42:12):**  Anyone who's got an even remotely suitable climate, they should be giving these a go  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:42:16):**  and adapting them to local conditions.

**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:45:36):**  So no irrigation.

**[0:45:50-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:45:50):**  If I had to get trucks of manure in I'd find another way.

**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/what-would-agriculture-look-like-with-zero-inputs-with-shane-simonsen-author-of-zero-input-agriculture/#t=0:45:56):**  The other thing I use are ash and I make my own charcoal in just a really simple kind

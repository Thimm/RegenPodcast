**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:13):**  Hey, and welcome back, everybody.

**[0:00:21-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:21):**  time.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:22):**  For years, I've been thinking about how to connect with some of the other podcasters  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:25):**  and content producers that I've admired and learned from.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:29):**  My initial motivation, after all, was to contribute something to this incredible body of work  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:33):**  that was being built online and made available for free.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:37):**  These resources are behind my own professional growth and the success of many of the projects  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:42):**  that I've been involved with.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:43):**  And eventually, I wanted to take the next step and work directly with other creative  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:47):**  producers in hopes of growing beyond each of our own skillsets.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:51):**  Now, if anybody else is listening to this who is also involved in creating online content,  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:00:56):**  you can probably relate to the fact that it can be quite lonely at times.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:00):**  Now, I feel really lucky that I get to speak with new and fascinating people all the time,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:05):**  but it's almost always over a Zoom call.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:08):**  And even after the episodes go live, I receive a lot of positive feedback, but often from  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:12):**  people that I've never met as well.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:15):**  And yet one of the primary motivations for doing this work is to build community around  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:19):**  the ideas and the skills that are presented on the show.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:23):**  And so for a long time, I was looking for a way to work more closely with others who  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:26):**  are motivated by the same goals.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:29):**  And then about a year ago, I figured that I'd reach out to some of my heroes in the  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:32):**  podcasting space to see if they'd be interested in creating a group to support one another  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:37):**  and to continue to improve the quality of our shows, while brainstorming ways to support  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:42):**  others and especially newer creative producers in order to launch their own shows and channels,  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:48):**  all with the vision of strengthening regenerative-focused media.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:51):**  Now, I was amazed at the enthusiastic replies from two of the podcast hosts that had been  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:01:56):**  instrumental in the formation of my own show, and from there, the idea began to grow.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:02:02):**  Now little by little, we overcame some big time differences, some conflicting schedules,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:02:07):**  and the nervousness of working with new people that we still didn't know super well.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:02:11):**  And gradually, our meetings became more frequent, and our little concept began to take shape  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:02:16):**  and grow beyond my own initial vision.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:02:19):**  And today, I am proud to announce the launch of the Regenerative Media Alliance.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:02:24):**  That is Jill Cloutier from Sustainable World Radio, Scott Mann from the Permaculture Podcast,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:02:30):**  and myself.

**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:23):**  We each discuss how our shows have evolved and what we've learned during this time,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:27):**  as well as the idea for the Regenerative Media Alliance and where it's headed.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:31):**  So be sure to stick around until the end where I'll be announcing some of the events and

**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:39):**  to sign up.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:41):**  Now I'll hand things over to Jill, Scott, and myself.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:46):**  Then Jill, how did you discover and get involved with permaculture?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:50):**  I was running a program at the juvenile hall in Santa Barbara called Kale Not Jail that  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:57):**  my friend and I started.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:04:58):**  It was a horticultural therapy program for kids on probation.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:02):**  So my friend and I started this big organic garden there.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:05):**  And a lot of our colleagues and friends called it hippie 101 because we were teaching them  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:10):**  organic gardening and we were growing medicinal herbs.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:14):**  We were teaching them meditation and mediation and nonviolent communication skills.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:20):**  So we'd have like all these kids and most of them were in gangs.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:22):**  We'd be sitting there under the tree, sipping herbal tea and talking about our feelings.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:27):**  It was great.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:28):**  It was really rewarding and wonderful, but the garden sucked.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:31):**  It was just terrible.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:33):**  Nothing would grow except medicinal herbs.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:35):**  We'd have like corn growing that was, you know, there were cobs of corn on the corn  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:40):**  and then we'd come back the next day and it would all be eaten.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:43):**  So the wildlife was so happy because they just ate everything we grew.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:47):**  And so probably two years into the project, Wes Rowe, who's of Santa Barbara Permaculture

**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:55):**  He showed up just out of the blue and he's like, I want to volunteer with you.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:05:59):**  And I'm like, oh, okay, how'd you hear?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:01):**  He goes, I don't even know how I heard about you.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:02):**  I just want to volunteer.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:05):**  So he very subtly and quietly turned it into a permaculture site, teaching me, my friend  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:11):**  and I, the teachers there, right, as well as the students about permaculture.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:16):**  So that was really my first introduction to permaculture.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:19):**  And when Wes, you know, he lent me a few books and I remember reading the permaculture ethics  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:24):**  and just thinking like, oh my gosh, like I found my people.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:28):**  Like earth care, people care for, this is amazing.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:31):**  And then we had a food forest there and Wes was just like a magician.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:35):**  He'd get people to donate all these plants and the garden started working much better  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:40):**  and you know, integrating in the food forest, we have the different layers.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:45):**  So it was really my first introduction of permaculture through Wes volunteering at that  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:50):**  Sari Garden that ended up really thriving.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:54):**  It's still the wildlife, got most of the stuff, but it was really a great way to be introduced  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:06:59):**  to permaculture was through actually doing it.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:02):**  So that was how, and then I ended up taking many courses in it and that was it.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:07):**  And I was hooked ever since that first introduction to it.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:11):**  And then Oliver, how did you come to all of this?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:15):**  So permaculture was not something that I jumped into directly.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:18):**  I think you and I have talked about this before, but when I left school, I did so somewhat  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:24):**  with the motivation that I wanted to provide the things that I most needed and create a  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:28):**  rich life without having to work indirectly for it.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:32):**  And the most expensive thing that usually is in people's way from living how they want  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:37):**  is having a house.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:39):**  And it's very difficult to finance a home these days, kind of regardless of where you  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:43):**  are.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:44):**  And so I first got into home building, building small homes for yourself, which very quickly  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:50):**  went into using natural materials to build your own homes, things that you didn't have  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:53):**  to buy that you could harvest from the land or that you could elaborate or produce from  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:07:58):**  basic materials like wood or mud or stone.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:03):**  And as I started getting into natural building, which was really my first love and my first  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:07):**  kind of specialty, I got asked to design homes for clients or other buildings.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:13):**  And as soon as you start to get into home design, you're creating lifestyles, you're  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:18):**  creating living environments, whether it's the indoor environments, which very quickly  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:23):**  you realize is affected and dependent on the health of the outdoor environment.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:28):**  And it's not just the immediate environment around.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:30):**  You have to kind of curate a space that creates a gradient between indoor and outdoor zones.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:38):**  And you can produce your own food, you can transform your waste into useful products.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:42):**  And as soon as you start looking at a holistic living environment, I very quickly started  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:48):**  to find the permaculture community.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:50):**  And there's a small amount of the built environment and ethics and design principles around that,  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:08:56):**  but it's much more focused on garden spaces and natural environments.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:01):**  And between the design principles and especially the patterns that they teach, I could see  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:06):**  the overlap in what I had learned about building design and how it flowed seamlessly into creating  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:12):**  entire regenerative living systems.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:14):**  And my design and building work for homes started to go into permaculture design for  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:20):**  gardens and started to move into restoration of damaged ecosystems with those same principles.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:27):**  And I worked for a while with a nonprofit out of the Netherlands called Ecosystem Restoration  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:33):**  Camps.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:34):**  Maybe people know John D. Liu and some of his work.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:37):**  And I helped to coordinate with restoration designs with people all over the world, but  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:41):**  started to become a little bit disillusioned with what was usually a nonprofit organization  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:46):**  that was meant to support these restoration efforts.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:51):**  And from there, I got into regenerative agriculture because that seemed like the most direct way  
**[0:09:56-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:09:56):**  to raise the money and create a financial incentive to do restoration work without having  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:04):**  to ask for money or constantly take your time away from working on the site and looking

**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:14):**  And so now most of my efforts go into some sort of productive permaculture related restoration  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:21):**  or regeneration.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:22):**  They're all kind of the same concepts.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:24):**  It's just different design frameworks that you may be tapping into in order to steward  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:29):**  the land as effectively and as wisely as possible.

**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:39):**  I came into it from different angles and now I have, I wouldn't say graduated beyond it,

**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:51):**  That's been my permaculture journey for me.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:54):**  And what about you, Scott?  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:55):**  Now you go quite a ways back with this.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:10:56):**  How did you first learn about permaculture and make it such a large part of your life?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:11:02):**  I first discovered permaculture in the 1990s when I was working at a US military facility.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:11:12):**  I was an intern for the US Coast Guard doing IT work because I was studying computer science

**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:11:23):**  but you know, there was this issue known as Y2K because for a long time computers only

**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:11:54):**  Many of my friends were hunters.

**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:13):**  of, we were seeing a lot of that kind of outlet, but it didn't agree with the space that we  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:19):**  came from.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:20):**  Because even though there were hunters in the group, and as I say, we were recreational  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:26):**  hunters, most of us were also radically nonviolent or pacifists.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:30):**  And pulling from that, we just didn't see that movement as a good fit for our politics  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:35):**  and where we came from.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:36):**  So I started looking for these community responses, and that's when I found permaculture.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:41):**  And then of course, Y2K was not as big of an issue as we thought it would be.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:45):**  And so some of those concerns kind of died away.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:48):**  My friends and I continue to hunt and hike and spend time together.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:53):**  But the impetus for that just kind of faded.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:12:57):**  But I still had that desire to learn more about permaculture in the back of my head.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:02):**  And so every couple of years, I would look up permaculture and see what was going on.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:06):**  But I always seem to have either the time or the resources to take a permaculture design  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:11):**  course, but not both.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:13):**  Early career and having work and all those things.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:16):**  And then eventually I found a local permaculture design course where I was able to go on weekends  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:24):**  and study with some folks who were close by.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:27):**  It was reasonably priced.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:28):**  And that kind of started my permaculture journey.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:31):**  And that's where I became a podcaster because I wanted to be able to share what it was that  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:39):**  I had learned.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:40):**  At the time, the concept of Take One, Teach One was really big.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:44):**  And that the outlets for permaculture professionals was to either teach or become a professional  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:49):**  designer.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:50):**  I looked at starting my own professional design business and it just wasn't the right fit.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:13:55):**  So as I have done throughout my life, I went back and looked at my skill set and decided  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:02):**  what have I done?  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:04):**  What do I know that would be useful?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:06):**  Podcasting had been around for a couple of years at that time.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:09):**  I had a background in radio.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:10):**  I had been a radio DJ and a music DJ off and on for a number of years.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:16):**  My background in computer science, I knew technology.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:19):**  So I just grabbed a laptop that I had and a cheap USB headset, some free software.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:25):**  I was running Linux at the time for those of you who are in that realm and just pulled  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:30):**  it all together and launched the show.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:33):**  At the time, it was the only podcast that was dealing specifically with permaculture.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:39):**  And so now I'm 12 years into this.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:42):**  As far as I know, it is the longest running, largest podcast dedicated explicitly to permaculture.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:48):**  I love it.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:49):**  I love broadcasting, I love being able to teach people.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:52):**  And so this is the space that I've remained in throughout this.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:14:55):**  And so that's how I came to permaculture and podcasting.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:00):**  Jill, how did you get involved in deciding to share what it is that you know and love  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:06):**  and all these stories for so many years?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:10):**  Well for me, similar background to you with the community radio.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:13):**  I had a job, I think in 2002 as a health educator for a nonprofit.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:18):**  All the other educators were, when I first got hired, were like, this job is so fun.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:22):**  You're going to love it, except for the radio show.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:25):**  It was like, what radio show?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:27):**  And they were like, oh, you have to host this radio show called Speaking of Sex.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:31):**  And it was the sex show on the local community radio station.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:35):**  So and I was like, oh my God, like, I'm kind of a, I can be kind of a ham, but speaking  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:41):**  of sex for an hour, but anyway, so my first show and I was, they told me you have to do  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:45):**  all the technical parts.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:47):**  So it's kind of scary, but I was trained and my first show, I was all excited.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:52):**  And I thought I had an hour's worth of material.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:55):**  And I get into the station and I'm reading my little essay.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:15:58):**  It was the history of birth control, I think was my first show.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:01):**  And it was six o'clock.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:03):**  The show started in at 6.15, I was just like done.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:07):**  So I'm like, oh, what am I going to do for 45 freaking minutes?  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:12):**  So I ended up taking long musical breaks and calling every friend I knew to call in with  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:18):**  questions.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:19):**  And that was my first experience in radio, which was so fun.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:22):**  And from then on, I was volunteering to do the show.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:25):**  I just was hooked on producing radio and producing shows.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:30):**  And then a couple years later, after discovering permaculture, I was on the phone with a good  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:37):**  friend who was also a permaculturist.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:39):**  And we are talking about plants and permaculture and Kevin, my partner just chimed in from  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:44):**  the other room and said, oh my God, why don't you just start a radio show?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:49):**  Because all you do is talk about permaculture and plant.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:52):**  And I was like, wow, that is a great idea.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:54):**  Because by then I had stopped working for that nonprofit and no longer did the speaking  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:16:58):**  of sex show.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:00):**  And so I approached the radio station.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:03):**  They said, yes, come on in.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:05):**  That was, I think, 2004.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:07):**  And as I continued producing these shows back then it was weekly and it was on ecology,  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:13):**  permaculture, anything having to do with nature.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:16):**  And at that point, my guests, like I was getting these in Paul Stamets, I was interviewing  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:21):**  like all sorts of people, pretty amazing, amazing guests.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:26):**  And I wanted to spread their message further than just start a local community.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:30):**  And so I Googled, like, how do you get your radio show like out into the world more?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:35):**  And I discovered the word podcast.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:38):**  So in 2004, I just Googled how to get your show on iTunes.

**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:45):**  I just, but I was kind of clueless, but I was giddy because I was so excited about how  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:49):**  amazing my guests were.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:51):**  Wanted to spread the word about solutions, uploaded my show to iTunes.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:55):**  And then that was how I started.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:57):**  I didn't know what I was doing.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:17:59):**  And I just still remember I was a new and noteworthy.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:02):**  And I may have told you this all over, but I was a new and noteworthy.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:04):**  And it was like all these great logos, the little icon pictures for the shows.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:09):**  And there were like logos and show names and then this picture of a tree.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:13):**  And that was my show.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:14):**  Like I was so clueless.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:15):**  I didn't even know, like, you need to have your name on the thing.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:19):**  You need to have your logo.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:21):**  But I was just so thrilled to be able to spread the word about permaculture.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:25):**  And I've been on there.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:26):**  I've been kind of a reluctant podcaster because I've always worked full time.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:31):**  And so I post when I can and, but I've loved it.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:35):**  And I still get so excited when I have guests on and just thinking about the thing I love  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:41):**  about podcasting is your shows can play all over the world.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:44):**  And I've had people contact me and I'm sure both of you have too.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:48):**  From all over the planet that have heard your show and it has impacted their life.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:53):**  So I think podcasting is just amazing.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:55):**  And I think it's an excellent way to spread solutions.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:18:59):**  And I've always just been, I wanted to be a voice for nature is really why I started  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:04):**  podcasting.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:05):**  And just to talk about like, what can we do?  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:08):**  What is in our power to do to make a positive difference?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:11):**  So that's kind of my story.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:12):**  And then Oliver, you've been podcasting for a number of years as well.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:16):**  How did you get into this?  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:18):**  Yeah, we're just wrapping up on five years, but honestly, the origin story is really thanks  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:23):**  to the two of you and a couple of other podcasters that I started to listen to probably around  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:29):**  the years between 2011 through 2015 is really when I started to learn about permaculture  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:36):**  properly and natural building.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:39):**  And this was really like the free education that I couldn't find in other institutions.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:46):**  And some of the main sources of education that I was getting while I was on my apprenticeship  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:51):**  for natural building.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:53):**  And I remember specifically that I was co-teaching a workshop in Senegal, we were building a  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:19:59):**  cob house.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:00):**  And I was talking with the students about some of these great episodes that I was listening  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:05):**  to.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:06):**  I'm sure a couple of them were from both of you.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:08):**  And we had this great student, this very petite girl with big head of blonde dreadlocks.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:15):**  I remember from Austria.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:17):**  And in the middle of me talking, she just piped up and she said, Oliver, your voice  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:22):**  sounds like a podcast.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:25):**  And I was like, wait, maybe.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:27):**  That was the first time it occurred to me that maybe I should contribute something to  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:31):**  this space as well.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:33):**  And then it took me a couple of years before I did anything about it.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:36):**  I went on to an internship with a bamboo builder named Charlie Rendell in Lake Atitlan in Guatemala.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:45):**  And while I was learning and constantly gathering different sources of information for free  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:50):**  online, it occurred to me that it's not that difficult to get started.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:54):**  I had a laptop, I could get a small microphone and for a small monthly fee, I could get a  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:20:59):**  hosting connection and just did a little bit of research and decided to go for it.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:04):**  I think I recorded some six episodes before publishing the first one.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:07):**  So I had a little bit of momentum and that's how this started.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:11):**  I have always felt motivated to contribute something to this kind of informal space of  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:18):**  people putting their information and their knowledge out for free to people.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:22):**  Because I mean, there's just so much potential in it.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:24):**  And it was such a big influence in my own growth and knowledge at this stage of my life  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:29):**  that I wanted to give something back.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:31):**  And I also really wanted to have conversations with all these people from these episodes,  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:35):**  but felt extremely insecure about contacting them and saying, hey, my name's Oliver, will  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:39):**  you spend an hour and answer my questions?  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:43):**  But I figured if I had a podcast, they would say yes.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:46):**  And that's exactly what happened.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:47):**  At least back then it was a lot easier because I'm sure they weren't getting like five proposals  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:53):**  a week to be on some random show.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:21:55):**  And so I was just amazed at the success rate I had from reaching out to people who are  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:01):**  happy to share their information and answer my questions.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:03):**  And honestly, I just started by scratching my own itch and asking the questions that  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:07):**  were relevant to what I was trying to discover and learn more about at the time.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:12):**  Back then I was starting to develop the first homestead that I was a co-owner of with some  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:17):**  colleagues of mine in the mountains of Guatemala.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:20):**  And there was tons of gaps in my information that I needed to fill in.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:24):**  And honestly, I just kind of kept doing it and set myself a goal of putting out an episode  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:28):**  every Friday.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:29):**  And five years later, here we are.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:32):**  Now, Scott, you already talked about a little bit how you got into podcasting.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:35):**  And it was a pretty seamless transition as you were learning about permaculture.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:42):**  What made you stick with it for 12 years?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:44):**  What has been something that has kept you motivated and interested in this for so long?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:49):**  It's funny, Oliver.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:51):**  The next question that I had written down for our conversation today was about why do  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:55):**  you produce your specific show?  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:22:57):**  And what you touched on about wanting to have these conversations with people is a large  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:02):**  reason why I started the Permaculture Podcast in the beginning was to kind of write my own

**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:26):**  senior year of high school.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:27):**  If there are any band families listening right now, marching band, then you know what it's  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:32):**  like to get children to and from summer practices and weekly practices and games and everything  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:38):**  else.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:39):**  And so I took a little bit of time off the show.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:41):**  And at the time, the Permaculture Podcast had like 300 subscribers or so getting some  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:47):**  good regular downloads, and it was enjoyable.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:49):**  But when I took that break, I came back and asked myself whether or not I wanted to continue  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:55):**  doing this.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:23:57):**  And I wasn't sure at the time because it had been a number of months who possibly could  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:01):**  still be listening.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:02):**  And I had four times as many subscribers and listeners after taking a break than I did  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:08):**  when I was still producing all the time.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:11):**  And seeing that growth in those numbers said, hey, maybe there is some interest in this  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:16):**  that it's worth continuing to podcast.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:20):**  And then that was when I changed format from writing my episodes.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:24):**  I'd done a couple of interviews beforehand.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:26):**  But when I really changed my format, because I really wanted to learn a lot more about  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:31):**  the world that was out there.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:33):**  That's when I started to develop relationships with publishers and other folks to connect  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:36):**  with their authors and reach out to people.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:40):**  And yeah, at that time, podcasting people are just like, what is this?  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:45):**  You want me to do what?  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:46):**  What radio station is this?  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:47):**  I'm like, no, no, no, this is an internet broadcast.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:50):**  There are broadcasts on the internet, people will listen to us live, no, no, no, we'll  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:53):**  record and I'll produce.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:55):**  And so there was a lot of explaining in the beginning.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:24:58):**  And once we kind of got through the hurdle and podcasts were becoming more prominent,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:03):**  people were like, yeah, perfect, I'll be on your show.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:06):**  And then I went back to graduate school to learn more, and to deepen my personal understanding.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:13):**  And because that education opened a lot of doors, and that made a huge difference.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:20):**  I started being able to have different scientists on and have those conversations, which was  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:24):**  amazing.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:25):**  And it was around that time when I realized that I wasn't writing my own education anymore.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:31):**  But I wanted to have on voices that we were less likely to hear in the permaculture community.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:37):**  Yes, as a podcaster, there are certain names who are popular at any given time, or there  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:42):**  are books that are coming out that people really love that you ideally should have on  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:46):**  a show, because of just the business of podcasting.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:51):**  But knowing that there were all of these amazing people who would never write a book, because  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:25:57):**  that's not what they do, or because they're doing something permaculture adjacent, they  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:01):**  may not have the same opportunities.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:05):**  And that's when I really started to expand the show.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:09):**  But it was also around that same time that I'd spoken with a number of people who I thought  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:13):**  of as mentors, who were talking about how, you know, you learn permaculture in the landscape,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:18):**  but there's so much more than that.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:20):**  Look at chapter 14 of Bill Mollison's designers manual and everything they didn't get to.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:25):**  I believe it was around that time that I had my first conversation with David Holmgren.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:29):**  And he had said about how he and Bill had thought that permaculture would be a series  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:35):**  of permacultures, not this one kind of monolith, but rather an umbrella.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:41):**  And it was through ongoing conversations that I continued to realize how much there was  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:47):**  in the permaculture community to share.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:49):**  And so that's when I started going in different directions.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:52):**  It was around that time that I also reconnected with the faith that I had been raised with,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:26:58):**  which is also a big part of my permaculture story, because my focus on community and people  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:03):**  and earth care comes from growing up in a historic peace church.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:08):**  And that's where my views of non-violence and pacifism come from.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:12):**  I come from a family that on my mother's side that was very large, she had 11 brothers and  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:17):**  sisters.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:18):**  I was one of 18 cousins and we would get together for summer cookouts and there'll be 100 or  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:25):**  more people in my grandmother's backyard cooking, playing music, drinking, a whole bunch of  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:31):**  Appalachian Hill folks telling stories.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:33):**  And they were the kind of people who grew up with so little.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:38):**  In my interview that I recorded with my grandmother before she passed away, I asked her why she  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:44):**  taught us to be the people who we were.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:47):**  And because everyone was invited to her table.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:50):**  Didn't matter what your background was, what your ethnicity or race was, what your sexuality  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:55):**  or gender was.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:27:56):**  She always wanted to make sure that people had a place and were cared for and fed.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:01):**  And she was like, we were too poor to care.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:05):**  That was her experience growing up with the crushing poverty of Appalachia.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:10):**  And that's what my mother and her siblings experienced.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:14):**  And it was never wanting anyone else to go through what they did or to be hungry.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:20):**  And that's where all of this came together for me in this really radical way, being raised  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:26):**  brethren.

**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:31):**  the brethren are one of the Anabaptist traditions related to that.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:35):**  That's where I come from.

**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:40):**  can eat?

**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:47):**  as people care?

**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:28:54):**  other.

**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:06):**  in between.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:07):**  I've not heard from anyone from Antarctica, but if there are any scientists who listen  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:12):**  there, any of the stations, please let me know, because that would be awesome.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:17):**  It's knowing the impact that I have as a podcaster and the hundreds of people who have contacted  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:23):**  me and said, you know, what you've done made a difference for me.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:26):**  Putting that out there, Jill, you've been in this a long time as well.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:30):**  What keeps you going as a podcaster and why do you produce your show?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:34):**  Like I said, I think earlier, I just started the show because I wanted to be that voice  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:38):**  for nature and solutions because I felt like there was so much bad news, especially as  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:43):**  an environmentalist for so long.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:46):**  You know how you go to those documentaries and you walk out just feeling, it's overwhelming,  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:51):**  we can't do anything.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:52):**  And so the more that I started delving into permaculture and ecology, it was like, wow,  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:57):**  we can do some things.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:29:58):**  We might not be able to tackle the whole issue, but we can do things in our lives that will  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:03):**  add up and make a difference.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:05):**  So that was the main reason just to spread those solutions was why I started the show.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:09):**  And I have taken breaks too.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:11):**  I've been in the middle of one the past year, kind of.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:14):**  I took a break to produce and make a film about soil and carbon sequestration.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:20):**  I think in 2011, I was kind of not podcasting much at all and just put my energy into that  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:26):**  film to kind of spread that solution.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:28):**  Because I had interviewed Darren Doherty on my podcast and he was talking back then about  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:32):**  key line design and sucking that carbon and getting it back into the ground and sort of  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:38):**  the atmosphere.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:39):**  So that was really exciting.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:40):**  And that was like, I just want to spread this even more than podcasting will and get it,  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:45):**  you know, spread that message through film.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:47):**  So that was a break that I took with my podcast.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:49):**  But I think what what's keeping me going is just wanting to be a force for good on the  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:57):**  planet.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:30:58):**  And the guests that I am lucky enough to have on my podcast, it is an honor to spread their  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:03):**  message.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:04):**  And when I was a little girl, one of my favorite things to do was to make shows.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:11):**  And I'd interview like myself, I'd interview my family.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:14):**  And then I when I was out of them, I'd interview celebrities.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:18):**  And then I'd move on to inanimate objects in our house, and the plants in our yard.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:23):**  So it was kind of like one of my best interviews of all time when I was seven was the chair  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:26):**  in our living room.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:28):**  And what was it like to be of service to people in our house.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:32):**  And so I've always wanted to interview and just love that aspect of interviewing people  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:38):**  or things, and the creative part of it and the connection and the curiosity.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:44):**  And I think Oliver, we talked a lot about this and the time that we did that interview,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:48):**  it's I think being curious is really important as a podcaster.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:51):**  And that, I guess really why I produce my show, I'm obsessed with plants is one big  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:56):**  reason.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:57):**  I was obsessed with permaculture.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:31:59):**  Now, I think it's more just Earth, plants, nature, animals, I want to speak up for those  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:05):**  who don't speak our language, and really educate about this beautiful, amazing world that we  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:12):**  live in.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:13):**  And to highlight some of these things that people don't talk about the plants that we  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:19):**  share the planet with just to do a show on a certain plant has just been so much fun  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:23):**  for me to delve into that.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:25):**  And Oliver, you got into some of this with your response about why you became a podcaster.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:31):**  But why do you produce your specific show?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:33):**  I know that you've changed directions and format over the time.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:36):**  So why don't you share a little bit about the show that you're currently creating and  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:40):**  why you've chosen to go in this direction?  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:42):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:44):**  Because my show has taken some turns, especially recently.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:48):**  So in the last year, I changed the name from what it used to be, which was the Abundant  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:52):**  Edge podcast, to the Regenerative Skills podcast, because a you kind of have to be a little  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:32:57):**  bit of a nerd like myself, to get the Abundant Edge reference.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:01):**  It's a reference to a concept in biology about, you know, two ecosystems coming together,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:06):**  and they're being more abundant life in the edge space, which, you know, is understood  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:10):**  by people who are into this.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:12):**  But if you just see the title, it doesn't necessarily make sense.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:16):**  And I felt like regenerative skills was very much on the nose of what I was trying to produce  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:21):**  and what I was trying to put out into the world.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:22):**  And that has also been a big motivator and a big driver for me to continue to evolve  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:27):**  this show, and to improve my own skills.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:31):**  But honestly, all of this started when I had a very short lived blog while I was an apprentice  
**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:35):**  in a natural building company.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:38):**  And I realized that just having the mentality of going about your life looking to document  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:43):**  the important parts of the learnings, and to speak to other people or conduct interviews  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:49):**  was a mindset that really made me feel good.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:53):**  It sparked my curiosity.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:33:54):**  It made me look for poignant and memorable aspects of what I was doing day to day, and  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:34:01):**  to make note of them and to communicate them in a way that was a little bit more curated.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:34:07):**  It pushed my thoughts beyond, you know, kind of how we just kind of glide through our thinking  
**[0:34:12-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:34:12):**  most days.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:34:13):**  And that was something that I was able to translate into the podcast and think about  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:34:18):**  the questions that I was asking to go beyond just yes or no answers and to probe beyond  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:34:24):**  perhaps even what the person who I was speaking to was used to giving as a response.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:34:29):**  And see if you could go a little bit deeper or get them to think about something that  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:34:33):**  perhaps they'd spoken about many times before in a new way or from a new perspective.

**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:35:04):**  of the last year, and now thinking ahead to this next year as well, how can I bring about

**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:36:18):**  that get to those things that they can do in real life, that it's more empowering than

**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:36:57):**  than something that you just listen and maybe not do anything with, of which goodness knows

**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:04):**  I mean, you've been mostly focused on the long format of interviews, which have been  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:08):**  fantastic for getting deep into the information that someone might hold, but you and I have

**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:19):**  want to add on top of the interviews.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:21):**  Can you talk a bit about that?

**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:30):**  me.

**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:37):**  or the permaculture librarian, having run the show as long as I have all the books that

**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:45):**  And it's for every person who I've featured, there are 10 people who I haven't had the

**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:53):**  And so I used to joke that I could release a new episode every day and it would take  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:37:58):**  three or four years.

**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:04):**  who I could have on the podcast at this point.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:07):**  But the show is still largely a one-person operation.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:10):**  I have some folks who are volunteering behind the scenes to help me with certain pieces  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:14):**  of it.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:15):**  But when it comes to the actual production of the show, posting and all of that, it's  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:19):**  me.

**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:24):**  to share some of their material because I'm really interested in getting different voices  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:28):**  out there.

**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:35):**  podcast, there is just so much available.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:39):**  And so what can I do to continue to curate conversations that are meaningful in the moment  
**[0:38:44-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:44):**  and what it is that we're working on or responding to as climate change continues to create ongoing  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:51):**  weather weirdness?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:52):**  How can we have a grounded conversation about that that can speak to the political issues  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:38:59):**  without necessarily being political?  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:01):**  Yes, I have a political perspective and I'd like to speak more from that space.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:06):**  But I understand as I shared earlier about like the faith tradition that I was raised  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:10):**  in, I didn't realize until I was about this many years old how radical my upbringing really  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:16):**  was.

**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:23):**  As I dive into all of that and my interest in people care as an expression of EarthCare,  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:29):**  what are the conversations that we can have that continue to deepen that?  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:33):**  I'm thankful for people such as yourself who are available to really get the practical

**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:47):**  people know that there are a lot of us working on this.

**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:39:55):**  but as permaculture adjacent, that if there's something that you want to work on as a permaculture

**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:40:23):**  that permaculture makes possible.

**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:40:39):**  When Oliver first approached me, I felt like it was such a great idea to come together.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:40:44):**  We have very similar interests.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:40:46):**  We have a common mission.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:40:48):**  And I felt like it would be great because as we've spoke about in this podcast is that  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:40:53):**  radio and podcasting can be quite lonely.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:40:56):**  You're connecting with your guests, but you're putting this work out into the world and it's  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:00):**  like, is anyone listening?  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:03):**  It's been so helpful for me to speak with both of you about our podcasts, guests, podcast  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:09):**  episodes, equipment, tech.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:12):**  It's been really helpful.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:13):**  And so I envision the RMA is just this larger organization that can really uplift other  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:18):**  podcasters and media content producers.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:21):**  And that it's been so helpful for me personally, that I can see how it would really help a  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:26):**  lot of other people.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:27):**  And I think that by being a member of the RMA, that hopefully we can all come together  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:35):**  and then really start having a larger impact.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:39):**  And Oliver, though we just heard from Jill as a member of the RMA, you were the person  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:44):**  who connected us to create this idea of the Regenerative Media Alliance.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:48):**  And so I was wondering what was your impetus for getting us going?  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:53):**  Yeah, it's been a while since we've been having conversations about this and it's taken on  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:41:58):**  a lot more life and a lot more specificity than I had envisioned at the beginning.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:03):**  Honestly, I just admired both of you as media producers.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:07):**  I've listened to your show for years.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:09):**  You were a large inspiration for starting my own.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:12):**  And I've gotten better, partly through producing these shows, of just reaching out and asking  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:18):**  people for things.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:19):**  And I've been amazed at the positive response that I've gotten for it.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:24):**  So when I got the idea of reaching out to you individually in a few of the other podcasts  
**[0:42:30-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:30):**  that I admired, I thought, well, why shouldn't we be working together?  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:33):**  Much like Jill already said, this can be a lonely endeavor.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:37):**  We're usually, especially at least in the intros and the outros, speaking into a microphone  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:42):**  to nobody.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:44):**  And best case scenario, we've got a good back and forth with the person that we're interviewing.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:48):**  Or if we have a panel discussion, there's a little bit more back and forth.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:52):**  But a lot of the times, we're just sitting in front of our laptops and we don't get to  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:42:56):**  interact that much with other people in this space or the audience all that much.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:01):**  And that's what I was craving.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:02):**  I mean, that's a big motivation of why I put these out in the first place is to make these  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:06):**  sort of connections and to instigate conversations rather than have these be as sort of a one-way  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:12):**  teaching platform, which was never kind of how I envisioned it.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:15):**  And so with the opportunity of getting in touch with both of you and learning from your  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:19):**  experience, which is far beyond my own, not only for the time that you've put in, but  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:23):**  for your knowledge of technology, your backgrounds in radio for both of you, I knew that I could  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:29):**  learn a whole lot and hopefully even contribute something from my perspective.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:33):**  And that certainly seemed to be the case as we've had conversations about this and new  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:38):**  ideas have popped up and certainly potential has emerged that I could not have seen on  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:42):**  my own, which was really what I was hoping for.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:44):**  And we're not super sure where this is going to go.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:48):**  We've got some great visions.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:49):**  We've got some ideas about what it could be, but all the more reason to open this up and  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:43:55):**  include more people and try and strengthen this movement so that people don't feel isolated.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:00):**  It really is collaboration and community that brings power to these concepts.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:05):**  And the more that we can come together and reinforce or empower one another with our  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:11):**  own ideas, I think this is only going to be for the best.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:15):**  And for you as someone who has been central to the conversations that have gotten us to  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:19):**  this point where we're actually talking about it, what are some of the ideas that have come  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:23):**  about through this concept of collaboration and where do you see the potential in bringing  
**[0:44:29-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:29):**  this forward in the year to come?  
**[0:44:31-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:31):**  Well, as I've mentioned through this conversation, for the first 11 years of the podcast, 99%  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:38):**  of the podcast has been on my own.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:41):**  And around the time that you reached out about the RMA was at the time where I realized how  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:48):**  I couldn't keep doing this on my own.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:50):**  I needed to collaborate with others and that for all the mentoring that I have done with  
**[0:44:57-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:44:57):**  other individuals over the years that I hadn't necessarily asked for that myself or to have  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:04):**  developed the relationships with my colleagues in the community.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:09):**  And so when you asked me about the RMA, it felt like a great opportunity to be both the  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:16):**  teacher student and the student teacher, to borrow from the pedagogy of the oppressed,  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:20):**  and to be able to participate in a community where like you and Jill, though we had only  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:25):**  spoken a couple of times off air, were folks who I really admired, as well as some of the  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:30):**  other people who you had mentioned you had reached out to as part of this process.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:35):**  And so the Regenerative Media Alliance felt like a place for me to meet with some colleagues  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:41):**  and to not be as on my own anymore.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:45):**  And through that, realizing how much each of us have worked on, that we have more than  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:50):**  25 years of experience between the three of us, and that we have a lot to offer people  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:55):**  who are in this media space.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:45:58):**  And that I hope that if somebody's listening to this who wants to start a podcast or has  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:46:03):**  started a podcast, that they will take advantage of the calls and programs and other things  
**[0:46:08-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:46:08):**  that we're working on for people in this space.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:46:12):**  You know, whether it necessarily means that they want to talk about permaculture and their

**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:46:29):**  It's never been less expensive or easier to become a podcaster.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:46:34):**  It may never grow into something that is in the top, you know, one tenth of 1% worldwide  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:46:39):**  for podcasts, but even if you have a couple of listeners, you can change somebody's life  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jill-cloutier-scott-mann-and-oliver-goshey-on-the-launch-of-the-regenerative-media-alliance/#t=0:46:43):**  today by putting your voice out there now.

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello everyone and welcome to this episode of the abundant edge the podcast that delves into the worlds of natural building permaculture and  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:07):**  Regenerative living. I'm your host Oliver Gautier  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:20):**  In this episode I had the pleasure of interviewing one of my heroes from the natural building world  
**[0:00:24-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:24):**  His name is Patrick Heneberry and he's built over 50 cob structures 20 or so conventional houses and has taught over  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:32):**  600 participants in more than 50 workshops though. He never went to university  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:37):**  He's a totally self-taught carpenter builder and he's very proud of his unconventional  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:42):**  Education because one of his mentors and one of my mentors as well Yanto Evans from the cob cottage company once told him that it  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:49):**  Was a good way to learn because he didn't have to spend a lot of time unlearning  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:53):**  He's extremely passionate about showing people how to live a simpler lifestyle  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:00:58):**  Buy less stuff and how to build a home with a smaller footprint  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:02):**  He says it's gratifying to see his students go on to build their own  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:06):**  Projects teach others and to become natural builders themselves in this episode  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:11):**  He'll tell us all about some of the creative ways that he used to get around the permitting and coating process  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:16):**  while building natural buildings on Main Island in British Columbia, Canada  
**[0:01:20-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:20):**  Canada he also gives some great stories about his experiences working with local communities in Mexico and  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:27):**  also share some great insights on his experience with the difference between  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:32):**  industrial and natural building a  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:35):**  quick disclaimer here  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:37):**  For the first time since I've started recording these podcasts. It was actually my internet connection  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:42):**  That was better than Pat's so his voice is gonna come in a little bit weak  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:46):**  But I promise that it's easy to understand him  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:50):**  There's just a little bit of distortion and reverb during the interview. So I hope you enjoy  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:56):**  Here's Pat  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:01:58):**  Welcome Patrick. Thank you so much for being with me here today  
**[0:02:00-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:00):**  It's good to be here. I wish I was in Guatemala. Yeah, the weather is really gorgeous right now. It's cool, but very sunny. How is it in Victoria? It's sunny today. It's about freezing.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:16):**  We had maybe a couple of snow but it's been quite sunny.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:21):**  That's not too bad  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:23):**  Well, hey, let's get started now  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:25):**  I'm a big fan of your work in the past, but I'd like to hear about how you actually got started  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:30):**  So what got you into natural building to begin with?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:36):**  Originally  
**[0:02:38-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:38):**  The natural building I was interested in was Sravaill. In the late 80s it was the catch word. I started building, I have 20 acres, I lived on the island in the Gulf Islands. I started building a lot of friendlies.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:02:58):**  I was in the infill with bales. Then I was at a natural building symposium on South Spring Island. It was a two day event. I was leaving the second day. They had all the literature laid out there. I was looking through a permaculture activist.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:03:18):**  I found this little carnead and it said, learn how to build your house out of my cottage company, cottage grow board and P.O. box.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:03:30):**  That was in 1995. I started a correspondence with John P.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:03:31):**  Wellness, a cottage company. I wanted a book. I've learned everything I know from books. I didn't feel I needed work. So he corresponded for about two years. He finally told me, we're working on the book. We don't have it out yet.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:03:58):**  So in 97 I took a seven day cardboard truck in Bella Coola off the coast in British Columbia. That just got me going. I thought I was meant to do this.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:04:16):**  So the next year I hosted a workshop with Yanto and Alcoa. We built a little car cabin in the mountains. And that started me. Since then I've built over 30 car houses.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:04:34):**  Wow, that's quite prolific. And so you were among the first people to get started with that revival here in the United States when Yanto and Linda originally brought it over.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:04:46):**  Why do you think it's important to make the switch from industrial construction to natural construction?  
**[0:04:54-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:04:54):**  Well, you just see how much waste. I was a carpenter, a soft top carpenter living on this little island. And I built maybe 20 conventional homes.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:05:07):**  And I was just astounded at the amount of waste in regular construction. And living on this little island I used to locally build, locally milled lumber.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:05:24):**  I built five car homes called gillments on my property on Main Island. And all the posts and beams and rockers and the wood was all from the beach for all five hours.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:05:40):**  So I knew there was a better way. You know, with the last waves, giving the guy with the sawmill on the little island the job and just using everything local. We had sand, we had clay, we had sandstone.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:05:56):**  They grow straw on Vancouver Island. So nothing had to come that far. And just some of the materials for conventional housing would come across the country and across the world.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:06:13):**  So I was trying to build a house just using local materials. Keep the costs down.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:06:20):**  That's fantastic. Now one of the most remarkable things about your work, you mentioned earlier, is that you're entirely a self-taught builder. How did you find the resources and the help to learn the skills you needed to be successful in building?  
**[0:06:36-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:06:36):**  When I moved, I had a young son that was two months old. I moved to Main Island from Vancouver. And we got hired from my wife's family. They had a lot.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:06:51):**  They did buy on Main Island in 1965 for $650. And I asked why they didn't buy Waterfront. And they said, oh, it was $850.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:07:06):**  So they had this lot. So they said they would help us get going. So I thought, okay. I had grown up in the interior of BC. It was smeared with log building.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:07:17):**  So I bought a book on log building, bought a chainsaw, and just built the house.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:07:26):**  So most everything I learned from books. And after I built my first house, I started doing all the jobs on the island. There was about 900 people who lived there.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:07:38):**  And started building decks. And then I got auditions. And then I kind of parched it my way into getting someone to build me the home.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:07:51):**  So that was the start. And I guess, you know, we got into my mentor, Carl Potty's company, he told me it was a good way to learn because I didn't have to unlearn a lot of stuff.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:08:05):**  Sure. That's the case for a lot of people. I know I come from a conventional building background. And I went to school to be an engineer.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:08:12):**  While a lot of those skills and that knowledge applies, there have been a lot of things that I've learned through natural building that have gone a little bit slower because I had to, like you said, unlearn some of the practices from the other industries.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:08:27):**  Yeah. Yeah, and what I've found over the years with natural building is everything kind of works.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:08:37):**  You know, you usually don't get it all up there, but you'll try something, whether it's plaster or a mix, a hard mix, and you'll just apply that knowledge that you learned from that onto your next house.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:08:52):**  So I've been fortunate to be able to build a lot of houses and, you know, I'm still learning stuff.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:09:01):**  Yeah, of course. That's one of the great things about continuing on that way is that it's a constant learning process. I'm right there with you.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:09:08):**  Now, you said that the books have been a huge influence on your learning and your growth as a builder. Do you have any recommendations of some of your favorite books or some of the resources that have really helped you out?  
**[0:09:21-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:09:21):**  I got books from Yanto. He used to get me a new book every year, and one of them is The Pattern Language by Kristian O'Famder.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:09:32):**  Yeah, I love that series.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:09:34):**  And Yanto described it to me as he said it's terribly printed. The pictures are off of the diagram, and it's very badly written, but he said it's an indispensable tool to every natural builder.  
**[0:09:50-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:09:50):**  When I started out, there wasn't too many books, so I used The Straw Bail Book by Donna Theisine, and that became my Bible.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:10:11):**  It had recipes for plaster, furs, and floors, and I had the fortune to meet. I went down to the Nacom  
**[0:10:16-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:10:16):**  Nacom  
**[0:10:12-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:10:12):**  I met Max Meerman, and he was one of the pioneers of straw bail, and I had his out on bail newsletter.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:10:40):**  It came out, I think, four times a year, and I learned a lot from that, and I finally got to meet him, so that was very good.  
**[0:10:50-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:10:50):**  I've got a lot of books now, but it's kind of after the fact. I was quite lucky, maybe not having been trained in school as a carpenter, that I can just look at stuff and build it.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:11:12):**  Most of the houses I'll make a model, or get the owner to make a model, but we won't necessarily have a plan. Especially as you know as a builder with carved houses, it's an ergonomic process to design.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:11:30):**  You have to have the owner on the job site. We'll build up three feet, four feet to your belly button height, and that's generally when all the windows go in.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:11:45):**  All the windows will be there, you use the windows, whatever they found, the owner found, whatever I got to the site.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:11:52):**  I get the participants in the workshop to hold the windows up where the owners would like them, and they can walk through the house and realize, oh, if you move that kitchen window over three feet, it'll get a view down the belly or the pond, the mountains, and then that's where the windows go.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:12:12):**  Yeah, absolutely, and it is a much more involved process because of it, but you often get a lot of results that fit the people who live in these buildings much more closely than a conventionally made structure would, because it has their scale and their opinions in mind.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:12:29):**  I've got conventional houses and the owners didn't come and see it until the framing was done, the roof was on, the windows were in, and whereas with Cobb, it's, you gotta be there.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:12:46):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:12:47):**  You have to make little decisions every day that come out.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:12:51):**  Yeah, that's definitely been my experience as well. Now, like we were talking about, you got started in Cobb when it was really young, the revival here in the United States. What were some of the biggest challenges back then in finding clients and projects?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:13:07):**  I was fortunate living on this little island. I never had a problem. I ended up building about 15 Cobb houses on this little island, so it wasn't a problem. The first cabinet building, a work truck, a Cobb house company, I called it a studio.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:13:31):**  Yeah. And it was a self-contained little cabinet, had water, no electricity though.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:13:38):**  And did that help you get around the permitting process?  
**[0:13:41-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:13:41):**  Well, what I did is I bought, the copper's companion had just come out a little, saw about Cobb, how to build the Yonko prints with Michael Smith and Linda Smiley.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:14:01):**  And I bought copies for the building inspector and the department, I bought two copies and I also bought them the Charvel bought. So when it came time to apply for a process for the studio, the local building inspector, he came from the next island over.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:14:20):**  He said, sure, we'll give you a permit. And the next year, my neighbor across the road from us, she wanted, she saw the building process and fell in love with it. She didn't necessarily need a house, but she wanted a guest house.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:14:37):**  So I approached the building inspection department and said, would you give me a permit for a Cobb house? Because now I don't have an issue in Canada at that point. And they said, sure. So I thought, well, I'm really going to push this.  
**[0:14:52-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:14:52):**  So I went two stories and made a load pick. And so I was turned in the car, I was turned in the house in 99. And I asked the building inspector, you know, by the way, they said you would give me a permit for a Yonko.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:15:11):**  And that was the day before everything happened to be engineered. And he said, well, we've been inspecting your construction work for the last 10, 15 years. And you've done a really good job with all your construction. So we trust you'll do it with this new Cobb construction.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:15:35):**  Well, it's fortunate. It goes to show what you can gain by establishing a good reputation and a good rapport with the building inspectors.  
**[0:15:44-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:15:44):**  Yeah, what I found is I've had a good rapport with the building inspectors here. The head inspector used to take me out for lunch once a year and we'd have a talk. And he would say, you know, we really like your building. We think you're one of the most  
**[0:16:06-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:16:06):**  artistic builders in the island, but you've got to play by some of the rules. What I really felt like over the years is they went behind me and closed all the loopholes that I had used.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:16:23):**  I built my first straw bale powerhouse that I lived in with my family for five years. It was originally going to be just straw bale. And so I listed it as an experimental storage shed.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:16:39):**  So when they came and inspected it upon inspection, he said, this is a pretty nice storage shed. I said, well, I've done pretty nice stuff.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:16:52):**  That's awesome. That's creative. I like that.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:16:55):**  When I would do a workshop on me in the summer or any of the other islands, I'd get the building inspector to come and talk to the group. Just showing them how important that dialogue was.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:17:09):**  And it was in the summer and all the regular building inspectors were on holiday. So we had our original, the head head guy of all of Vancouver Island come over.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:17:23):**  And he'd be in the first building inspector like meh, not meh, nah.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:17:27):**  So the participants had a question and answer period and they asked them, you know, why would you do a car house is what makes it different. And he said, I brought them a car house.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:17:41):**  It was from England.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:17:44):**  Yeah, wow. That's remarkable. You don't find many people who have had that experience anymore outside of England or a few other places in Europe.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:17:53):**  And what happened, what I saw happening was the inspector that issued me the permits for my car houses, it got him a certain amount of notoriety and he loved it.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:18:12):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:18:14):**  And he was getting emails and letters and correspondence from building inspection departments from all across the country and all across the United States.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:18:25):**  And they were asking what he did to improve it and stuff. So he really enjoyed that.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:18:32):**  Yeah, it sounds like you had a good advocate sort of working on your side after that point and helping to show people that these things, these structures can, you know, be very long lasting and worthy of approving.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:18:46):**  Well, they have in the building inspection code, it's called equivalency.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:18:53):**  Basically, it takes in everything that's not conventional building. And, you know, like lab houses, they're not in the building code, but they've lived in them for hundreds of thousands of years and they work.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:19:09):**  And it's the same with car buildings where they've lived in them for a long time.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:19:15):**  They know they work. And I think it now it's it's probably more difficult getting a building permit because they want everything engineered.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:19:26):**  So that's, I haven't found that to be a very big problem though, because they're not concerned about what's holding up the roof. They want to make sure it doesn't collapse.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:19:37):**  And so you just draw a plan for a timber frame or a wall frame structure and then the end show is cut off.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:19:48):**  As long as the roof's not going to fall down, they don't care what the wall is.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:19:55):**  Yeah, that's what I found as well. There's a lot of leeway if you can show that the roof is being held up with a material that they have metrics for and that they can understand with, you know, the engineering that they're used to using.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:20:11):**  And they're much more forgiving about different types of infill if you can prove that, like you said, the roof isn't going to fall down.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:20:20):**  I built during the summer of the last five years at Ira Eco-Vellage, the farm of the lake in Vancouver Island.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:20:31):**  And I built one with a group, a project, and it was about 300 square foot.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:20:39):**  And they didn't have a place for the garden manager today, so we started with a small place, but it had like a 600 square foot roof on it.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:20:50):**  It had a big overhang and made it totally load bearing.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:20:58):**  Now I'm not sure how they represented it. I didn't meet with the building inspector on that one, but I think it could have been just a tool shed.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:21:08):**  Right. I'm looking for loopholes in that way. Sometimes you can stay within the size limitations for a permanent building and get away with it that way.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:21:18):**  That's pretty small, 100 square feet.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:21:21):**  Yeah, definitely. That's usually well below what is required in most counties, most regions.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:21:26):**  Yeah, I think ours is 116 or something, but then they say, oh, that's the outside of the walls.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:21:34):**  Yeah, it depends on how they count the envelope. I agree. Sometimes they even count how far the roof overhangs.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:21:42):**  It's worth checking into if that's one of the approaches you want to do to get your building permitted.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:21:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:49-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:21:49):**  So now one of the reasons why I was so excited to talk to you is because you actually come from a conventional building career before you started a natural building, and that's not common of everyone.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:22:00):**  So one of the things that I really wanted to ask was what are some of the aspects and lessons from conventional building that apply to natural building as well?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:22:09):**  Well, I get a lot of people corresponding with me and they say, you know, they realize that I'm busy, I'm only one person, and I recommend someone to build them a car house.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:22:26):**  And it's really difficult because if there was more people that came from my background, it would be easier.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:22:34):**  There's a lot of good carvers out there. There's a lot of good carpenters out there. There's not a lot of carpenters.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:22:42):**  And so my advice to people that are taking workshops, whether they want to become a natural builder or whether they want to teach workshops, is to get as much carpentry experience as you can.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:22:57):**  You can learn cloud in a month. Pretty good.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:23:00):**  And, you know, after you build your first cloud house, you learn a lot.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:23:05):**  But you still got to put a roof on it. You still got to understand how window and door box fit, how you're going to fix cabinets or interior fastenings into the car.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:23:20):**  And so having a building background made it a whole lot easier.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:23:29):**  I agree. That's been my experience as well. A lot of the techniques and a lot of the skills that I learned from conventional building, doing renovations, doing retrofits and stuff have been some of the things that I've relied most heavily on when I build natural buildings as well.  
**[0:23:45-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:23:45):**  Like you said, a lot of the fundamentals of working with earth, especially cob, can be learned very quickly. But there's a whole nother skill set back there that a lot of other natural builders are a little bit short on and some of their projects suffer because of it.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:24:01):**  Now I'm not saying, of course, that you need to go and work on a bunch of conventional build sites, but at the same time recognize that those skill sets apply just as much in natural building, even if the materials that you're using are different.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:24:18):**  Yeah. Yeah. One of the things that the natural builders in my work too, I hope, or in California, is they had a bunch of the pioneers, they called them.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:24:33):**  And one of the questions was, how can we hand over the reins of power? And I was ever so impressed by many young people in their 20s and 30s that were building, that were women, very powerful women.  
**[0:24:52-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:24:52):**  They were the ones that seemed to attract women. I've always had more women come to my workshops than men. And everyone came away from that little meeting feeling that the charge was being passed very well.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:25:08):**  Yeah, that's fantastic. There are some really inspiring younger people getting started as well, I agree.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:25:14):**  Now on the flip side of what I asked you originally, what are some of the aspects of conventional construction and industrial building that could benefit from some of the ethics and some of the techniques that are learned through natural building?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:25:31):**  Hmm. I don't know about commercial aspects, but as far as residential goes, it allows people to learn how to build their own house and put the power back in their hands.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:25:51):**  You know, even the smallest house is still a house. It's still a big project. I've been making tiny homes the last couple years.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:26:06):**  And it's tiny, but it's still a house. There's still a lot of work that goes into it. And just the carpentry skills, timber framing, log framing, whole building, all of those things, I got to do them on main island.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:26:28):**  I just, for me, I just made it up. And that was okay. I think what people get when they take a cardboard chalk is they get confidence.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:26:41):**  And that's a big thing. I think that most people back in the building their own house, where do I start? You know, what if I can't finish this?  
**[0:26:54-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:26:54):**  And what they get from the workshop is just confidence as they realize the building process that if they started, they'll know how to keep going.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:27:05):**  Certainly. Now, let's switch gears a little bit for a second. I know you've been for a few years now doing many projects and workshops down in Mexico.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:27:16):**  Could you tell me a little bit about some of those projects and what first brought you to work down there?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:27:23):**  I went down with, I had a new wife, we were soon to be married, and it was in 03. We had an old 70's station wagon. We drove down to Baja.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:27:38):**  And we met up with another couple from main island and they've been associated with this family and this round for quite a few years. So we hung out there and I realized that they were living in a concrete block house.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:27:54):**  And there was three generations of people. It was crowded, it was hot, it was cold.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:28:00):**  And looking at the type of construction down there, which is much less than that block. So we talked with the owner of the ranch.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:28:11):**  He was the young guy, he was about 35. He had a 22 year old wife and three little boys.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:28:22):**  So I said, how about if we come down and we'll show you how to build a place out of the order.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:28:30):**  So they thought that was funny. They didn't believe it was going to happen.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:28:36):**  The next year we showed up and I started making trips to the airport to pick up participants.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:28:42):**  And I said, you know, there's going to be mostly women working on your house. And they laughed and laughed. They thought this was funny that these gringo women were going to build down my house.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:28:54):**  And then we started.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:28:59):**  One day the young wife, she was crying and sobbing at dinner time. And she said all the other people in the village were laughing at her because she was getting the house out of my house.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:29:12):**  So we assured her that she would have the most beautiful house.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:29:17):**  And I just saw pictures on Facebook. I haven't seen people for about eight years. And the house is totally beautiful. They had a fireplace in it.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:29:31):**  And we were, the day before we were going to leave that project, a guy showed up on the site from the next town over and he had a picture of the car, or he had a book that Yonta's new book had sorted out.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:29:51):**  And he said, he didn't speak any of this.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:29:56):**  Spanish is terrible. And he said come tomorrow to Santiago.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:30:03):**  So he took us there and met his family. He was a pharmacist in this little town. His wife is a doctor and he had two sons.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:30:15):**  I always, you know, built for the ranch for people that didn't have any money. But what I was rapidly finding out after several, probably six seminaries, is it's financially not viable.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:30:29):**  I have family, I have three kids, we have twin boys.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:30:36):**  The first time we drove to Baja they were two months old.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:30:42):**  And so it just wasn't financially viable. So then I built a house for these more affluent Mexicans.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:30:52):**  And it was amazing because what happened is all the people come out to see this house.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:30:59):**  And you know, if you're building for the poorest people they would think, oh that's okay for the poor people. But when they see a doctor and a pharmacist building this type of house, then they can build for the poor people.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:31:16):**  It made them much more accepting of it. I've seen that happen in a lot of places. It's hard to get opinions changed about what earthen building and what earthen architecture can be until you get someone with some status in the community to adopt it.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:31:34):**  And that's usually the quickest way to show people that this is a desirable way to build and not sort of a last resort for people who have limited resources.  
**[0:31:46-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:31:46):**  In 2012 I went down and I built a house for a retired doctor and his wife in the state of Sonora. And he's gone on, he takes a school group of kids into his home and he teaches them about car building and stuff.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:32:09):**  So he's become a really good ambassador for teaching other kids.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:32:19):**  One year we built for two friends of ours from Vancouver.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:32:27):**  And what we did is, it was about, it was in online, so we've been building down there for about five or six years in Mexico. And what we did is we hired all the people that we built houses for.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:32:44):**  We hired them to work on this house and it was a paying job for them. They didn't run it as a workshop. And that was another good way of, you know, they worked for four or five months on this house.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:32:59):**  So it gave them jobs and skills. Because most of the time you go after the workshop it's free to Mexicans, but they got jobs. Even though it's free they still can't afford it. So you're finding them to have to pay you to take over the shop.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:33:19):**  So by doing this paying job it worked out really well for the owners and for the family. The four brothers were in there one time.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:33:31):**  That's fantastic. Now for people who are just getting started building, who are considering for the first time working with earthen or other types of natural materials, what advice would you give to them?  
**[0:33:48-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:33:48):**  When people come and they take the cardboard shop they think they're just learning how to build a house with a marble. But what it's about, it's about building sustainable, it's about living sustainable, it's about making smaller footprint, it's about iron ladders.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:34:12):**  It's about working in community. It's about meeting new people and gaining new skills as a group of people. So it's a wonderful experience for people whether they want to build a car parts or not it doesn't really matter.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:34:32):**  It's a whole new way of looking at the world and the environment.  
**[0:34:43-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:34:43):**  What are some of the ethics that go along with the building skills like you mentioned of creating a smaller footprint, buying less things and finding more creative ways to use the resources that you have available. What are some of the key changes that someone can make to achieve those goals other than perhaps going to a natural building workshop?  
**[0:35:11-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:35:11):**  Something that natural building workshop is a good starting point for them. I encourage people to take any carpentry courses they can or just wander around to a job site with their building a small house, regular star house.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:35:30):**  What my dad taught me was if you want a job you go there every single day. You do that for a month they'll hire you. You might start carrying boards or pulling nails and stuff but you don't be learning power tools.  
**[0:35:49-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:35:49):**  You need to pick up, you need a place to store. You start driving around back aisles and see how much stuff is just laying there.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:36:00):**  One of the theory classes I do during the course of the workshop is how to get research on stuff. Most of us are embarrassed to ask for stuff. They don't know you and the worst they can say is no.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:36:19):**  One of the things I've learned is when you use a pilot or a foreign pilot at someone's house, you go during the day and talk to the wife. She's going to say, sure take it. You've got to take it right now. Don't say you'll come back with your truck on the weekend.  
**[0:36:42-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:36:42):**  So just how to acquire stuff. I made a house this spring. It was 8 feet by 20 feet. We built the entire thing out of pallets. I've never built a pallet before so that was one of the things where you don't really start learning.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:37:04):**  It was wonderful. Pallets are great. They were used once. They were like brand new boards. There were big pallets out there. We found some that were 8 feet by 20 feet.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:37:19):**  Oh wow. I've used pallets a lot before but I've never seen them that big.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:37:24):**  They required two forklifts to lift it. I don't know what was on it originally but that would do for the whole roof one piece. It was heavy. We didn't have to cut it down.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:37:39):**  We ended up getting way too many pallets just because we were excited. Then we had to get rid of them so we had a tent sitting here for the homeless people and they had a sacred fire.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:37:55):**  So every week we'd take the trailer with old cut up pallets or packed pallets that weren't going to be used and they would come rushing out of them. They would do a creek in them.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:38:09):**  Nice. So since working in the natural building trades from, is it more than 30 years now?  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:38:16):**  For me?  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:38:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:38:19):**  Since you started in 1995? No, that's...  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:38:22):**  I took my first cardboard shop in 1997.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:38:26):**  Okay. So getting up there for sure. Definitely one of the people who have been doing this longer. What have been some of the most remarkable changes that you've seen in that time and where do you see things progressing and advancing in the years to come?  
**[0:38:41-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:38:41):**  I see pictures on the website of what people are building now. When I was doing it, everyone was Art Press but now you can see there's a lot of people doing it and they're really pushing it to the extreme for house art.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:39:00):**  And it's just beautiful creations. They've taken plastering and it's a whole new art form. Cadillac, earthen flooring and just every aspect of woodwork.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:39:15):**  I used to think, you know, until the earlier pictures I saw when I was starting out, how well, you know, a nice plastic cardboard stonework and carpentry work, how they are. When it was all done in pathway, it was such a beautiful work of art.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:39:34):**  And I see that more and more now.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:39:40):**  I don't know whether cardboard has become mainstream or not. Like straw bales, you can make it look like a conventional house. I mean you can do that with cardboard.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:39:56):**  Yeah, that's to disavow so many of the benefits of the material.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:40:04):**  I've been in a few square pop houses and they were fun. You know, after you build a certain number of pop houses, you can make the curves and stuff.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:40:17):**  But sometimes you just want to do it. And each house is built specifically for an owner. You kind of get a good feel on what the owner wants with their life.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:40:36):**  And so where do you see some of the advancements and some of the direction within the natural building world going in the years to come?  
**[0:40:46-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:40:46):**  Or what would you like to see more of perhaps?  
**[0:40:53-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:40:53):**  I'd like to see it more used as building for homeless or just an inexpensive way. It can be inexpensive. It's not necessarily so.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:41:08):**  For people that need homes, that's where the biggest need is. And I think by building homes for some of the more affluent people, like we said before, it shows that this is what the rich people are living in.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:41:24):**  I mean in Mexico where they built the small pop houses, they've been looking for years and that's what they built in America. So that's what they want.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:41:33):**  So I think that in countries like Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Mexico, that there's a real need for showing people. Do you know Liz Jandra?  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:41:48):**  I do. I actually just interviewed her about a week ago.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:41:51):**  Okay. She was at the Club Biv. She took her first cardboard sock with us in Mexico.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:41:58):**  Oh, fantastic. Yeah, so I assisted on a natural building workshop with her at the beginning, or no, at the end of November of last year. And also with Charlie Rendell. So we added some bamboo elements in there as well.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:42:15):**  Okay. I never did get to work in, but what I'm finding is you don't have enough time to do it all.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:42:26):**  Yeah. And not all of it really applies or is ideal for working in certain climates. I'm sure you could make bamboo work in a colder northern climate, but at that point you're importing it from so far away and you're forcing it to do things that it isn't really designed to do.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:42:45):**  That, you know, it starts to lose its sort of eco or green factor at that point.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:42:51):**  Well, I've seen huge stands of bamboo growing in Vancouver and Portland, Seattle.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:42:59):**  Yeah, actually I know a guy who's got a bamboo forest there and cultivates it for all sorts of different uses, but the really large grade types that are used in like beam construction, they don't grow that far north.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:43:14):**  Yeah. You could still use it for a while and it's got lots of good uses.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:43:19):**  Oh yeah. Yeah. All different types of bamboo are endlessly useful and certainly it could be used in certain aspects of construction up there and definitely for interior decorating, maybe some accent pieces. There's tons of uses for it for sure.  
**[0:43:37-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:43:37):**  Just I don't get stuff from the beach. So we call it a long lumber yard, but I'm just playing the day at the top. And yeah, I have a different take, but natural building materials. They're all not really natural, but I think if you're keeping something on the landfill, it's got to happen.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:44:01):**  Yeah, absolutely. I was in lumber one time and they had someone, some project that needed, you know, the OSB?  
**[0:44:11-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:44:11):**  Yeah. And they cut an 80 inch piece up to four foot wide piece, a sheet of this stuff. And there was four halves of it. Eight inches by 48 inches.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:44:26):**  And they were going to haul it to the dump and it was free, but you had to take it all. So I got a friend with a two ton truck there and they loaded it up and I thought, my God, what am I doing? How am I going to get rid of that?  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:44:41):**  With an 80 year old, it's hard to find.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:44:43):**  Yeah. There's always a use for that. And like you said, recycling and reusing materials, if they're going to get chucked anyway, that's definitely a benefit.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:44:54):**  I made a pole building during one workshop and we covered the roof of this. It was half inch OSB and I put two layers on and it got rid of about a third of it.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:45:09):**  But yeah, it all got used. It's the same we have at the Recycle Depot. They have a painter's exchange and you can go out there and all the paint is free.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:45:24):**  So you can get oil stains and stuff like that. But if you're going to paint anything, there was five gallon buckets of unopened paint. The contractors bring it in.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:45:36):**  Wow. Just over orders and yeah.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:45:39):**  You just sign for it and you can take as much as you want.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:45:45):**  Yeah, that's a remarkable resource. It's one of the nice things. Well, nice and bad things about living in countries that kind of overconsume and are extremely wasteful is that you can get a lot out of those waste streams.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:45:58):**  Those waste streams don't really exist, I'm sure as you've seen in Mexico or here in Guatemala. But there's benefits to that too.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:46:06):**  We had, we were building this ranch in Baja and they had their own garbage dump right in front of the house.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:46:17):**  I used to send a couple of guys down there every morning and say, okay, we need wires. There's old cars. We need wires. We need this. We need that. And they would go down to this Mexican garbage dump and bring back stuff.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:46:31):**  I tell you the Mexicans were so impressed. I got paid the greatest compliment. They said that I would make a good Mexican.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:46:40):**  That is high praise.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:46:45):**  So before I let you go here, do you have any upcoming projects or workshops in the near future?  
**[0:46:55-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:46:55):**  I did a lot. I built four places this year and it kind of wore me out. So, AfriHands is about taking too much time. I'm looking at Kenya.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:47:08):**  Really?  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:47:10):**  Teaching the Africans how to build out of mud.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:47:14):**  It's interesting that certain communities there need to rediscover some of their traditions. I myself worked in Senegal building with mud, cob and adobe there.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:47:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:47:26):**  It's strange because they're not, they're only one or two generations and sometimes not even that removed from building with mud. And it's incredible how quickly those traditions can get lost.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:47:37):**  It is because you're not teaching them and they don't have it. It's the same in Senegal. We get old guys coming onto the site and they can remember building the same one with the car, with their prime father when they were little.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:47:56):**  Yeah. Yeah, it's really not that far removed. Well, are you planning on hooking back up with Alka-Kohl when you get to that area?  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:48:05):**  No.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:48:07):**  Okay. I heard she's in Cameroon at the moment.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:48:11):**  She was in, then she went to Kenya. A lot of people going and my friend just got back. Do you know Conrad from  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:48:30):**  I haven't been in contact with Conrad, but I know of his work.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:48:34):**  Yeah. He was at the Calarquim in California and then from there he went on to six weeks in Kenya. So he's back in Oregon now. But yeah, I heard a lot of different people doing stuff there.  
**[0:48:50-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:48:50):**  Yeah, there were some fantastic projects going on in that region. Well, okay, so for people who want to get in touch with you and maybe learn more about your work and read some of the articles that you've put out, how is the best way to get in contact with you?  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:49:06):**  Through email. I don't have a phone.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:49:09):**  Fair enough. And I'll be sure to put your email address in the show notes for anybody who's looking to get in contact with you there. Also,  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:49:20):**  The website is just cobworks.com.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:49:22):**  And if anybody hasn't seen that already, there's some fantastic articles on there. And I believe you're trying to release a book soon. Is that true?  
**[0:49:32-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:49:32):**  I'm working on it.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:49:34):**  Excellent. And I think if I saw correctly, if you subscribe to the newsletter, you'll get updates on when that book will be coming out. Correct?

**[0:50:23-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:50:23):**  Yeah. It really sucks you in this community. There's some, well, to say nothing about the beauty of the climate and the landscape and the culture. It's just a great place to be.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:50:34):**  Which town are you in?

**[0:50:49-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:50:49):**  Okay, bye.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:50:50):**  Thank you so much for tuning into this episode. I hope you enjoyed it.  
**[0:50:53-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:50:53):**  As always, you can go to the website at AbundantEdge.com for all of the show notes from this episode, as well as a full range of contracting, design, and consulting services, and an extensive list of educational articles all about natural building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:51:09):**  As always, the point of these podcasts is not to be a lecture series or a one-way conversation. I really want these to become a dialogue.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:51:16):**  So please leave comments and feedback in the comments section on the show notes on the website.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:51:21):**  I really look forward to hearing from all of you. Your feedback is what makes these episodes better each time, especially here in the early days when I'm just getting started out.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:51:30):**  I would love to hear what you would like to hear more of, and perhaps who you would like to hear from.  
**[0:51:35-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:51:35):**  Until the next time, thanks so much for listening.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-004-patrick-hennebery/#t=0:52:05):**  Thank you.

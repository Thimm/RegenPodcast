### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 04:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:41):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:14):**  Every Monday, to get your week started off right, I'll send you a new regenerative  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:18):**  skill that you can develop and expand on in your own life right away.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:22):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:26):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:31):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:36):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:42):**  In the past, I've talked to quite a few orchardists and agroforestry practitioners,  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:46):**  especially in the series on reforestation and agroforestry at the end of last season.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:51):**  But I was really glad to be introduced to Michael Phillips' work by a great friend  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:55):**  of the show, Nick from Minnesota.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:01:58):**  After speaking late last year with Stefan Subkowiak, Nick recommended that I look into  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:03):**  Michael's incredible books for an even deeper dive into the soil health and biological spraying  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:08):**  mixes that Michael has developed to promote holistic health as he pioneers the revival  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:13):**  of the community orchard.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:16):**  Michael Phillips is a farmer, writer, carpenter, orchard consultant and speaker who lives on  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:21):**  Heartsong Farm in northern New Hampshire, where he and his family grow apples and a  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:25):**  variety of medicinal herbs.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:28):**  He is also the author of The Apple Grower and The Holistic Orchard.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:33):**  His Lost Nation Orchard is part of the Holistic Orchard Network and Michael also leads the  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:37):**  community orchard movement at GrowOrganicApples.com.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:42):**  He was also honored by Slow Food USA to receive the very first Betsy Linden Ark Award in 2005  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:49):**  for his work promoting healthy ways to grow fruit.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:53):**  In this interview, we take a deep look at what goes into growing healthy and delicious  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:02:57):**  apples beyond what most people know about.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:00):**  Michael talks about the essential importance of diversity in a resilient orchard ecosystem  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:05):**  and how it has to be balanced by what you need to make a profit at market.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:09):**  We also cover a wide range of practical advice from pollinator and pest management, biological  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:15):**  mowing as well as foliar sprays, shifting climate zones, and much more.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:21):**  I get a real thrill from talking to people with such an obvious passion and love for  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:25):**  what they do, and in Michael's case that passion is coupled with a deep understanding  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:29):**  and knowledge of the science behind the health of his plants and soil.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:33):**  I highly recommend this one to anyone looking to grow fruit trees, even if you're not  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:37):**  looking to take it all the way to a production scale.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:40):**  So now I'll hand things over to Michael Phillips.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:43):**  Hey Michael, thank you so much for being with me today.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:46):**  How are you doing at this gorgeous time of the year?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:49):**  Oh, we're good here.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:52):**  Northern New Hampshire, this is spring and the biting bugs aren't out yet and it's  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:57):**  just glorious to work outside.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:58):**  Oh, perfect.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:03:59):**  And the orchard is coming into its own.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:02):**  It's very happy.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:03):**  Yeah, now your project has been developing for quite some time.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:07):**  As I've read through your work in the past, your production has increased as new plantings  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:12):**  have matured and your trees have gone online, but before we get into all of your orchard  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:17):**  practices and the content of your book, could you tell our listeners a little bit about  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:22):**  your personal background and how you began to develop a new path of holistic orchard  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:28):**  management at Lost Nation Orchard?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:30):**  So somehow I discovered this passion for trees in the path of my youth, and when Nancy, my  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:38):**  wife and I purchased our farm here, it was basically an overgrown, run-down mountain  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:45):**  farm that had been let go.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:48):**  And there were wild apple trees and I knew I wanted to get into orcharding.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:52):**  And my conception of things were that I would want to do it organically.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:57):**  I wouldn't want to use chemicals.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:04:59):**  But of course, I didn't know a whole lot back then in the mid-late 80s and so it was  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:05):**  just learning, reading, talking to other growers.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:09):**  And the consensus was that to grow fruit organically is basically impossible.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:17):**  It's just can't be done.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:18):**  And I thought, well, that doesn't make sense if we come back to our great-grandparents'  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:23):**  time that they were doing it.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:26):**  And so as I explored organic farming and that literature, my wife Nancy was involved with  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:32):**  learning about the healing plants, herbal medicine.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:36):**  And as part of her path in talking with different teachers, going to conferences, taking a home  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:43):**  study course, starting to make her own remedies, she needed to test those remedies.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:50):**  And that's where the role of the herbal husband comes in.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:54):**  And so suddenly I was being given remedies for all these conditions I didn't know I  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:05:58):**  had and in the process feeling better but also starting to understand how by supporting  
**[0:06:05-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:05):**  a biological system nutritionally and also becoming more aware of the biological connections  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:13):**  that underlie our health, all the microbes that make up who we are, that all made sense  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:19):**  for plants.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:20):**  That made sense for my trees.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:22):**  And so the notion of holistic orcharding was kind of launched between those two camps of  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:27):**  understanding, organic farming, building soil health, but also then bringing in kind of  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:34):**  that herbal perspective of how can we work with nutrition and biology to make a more  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:40):**  robust fruit tree, which in turn is then able to stand up to, I call it environmental reality,  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:47):**  of pests and diseases and go beyond that.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:50):**  And the result is fantastic fruit that is that much more intense as well.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:55):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:56):**  Yeah, I think that's fine.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:06:58):**  It's really great how sort of both of you are learning contributed to the benefits of  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:02):**  each one.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:03):**  And we'll get to how the diversity plays a role in the health of the entire ecosystem.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:08):**  But before we go too deep into that aspect, I wanted to explore a comment that you're  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:12):**  well known for saying, which is that a whole lot more goes into growing a healthy and delicious  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:18):**  apple than most people think.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:20):**  So let's start by talking about the hidden process behind fruit growing and getting the  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:25):**  product to market.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:28):**  So the idea of the healthy apple, any fruit, any produce, is that through fungal connection  
**[0:07:37-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:37):**  in the soil, working with soil bacteria, plants get the majority of their nutrients.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:45):**  That same kind of biological web extends up onto the surface of the plants.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:52):**  And when you start to work with biology, you are going to a much more complex place, but  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:07:57):**  also a place that this is how nature does health.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:02):**  And it takes a degree of understanding.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:05):**  There's no chemical shortcuts.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:07):**  But on the other hand, as you really get to working with the microbes and the fatty acids  
**[0:08:13-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:13):**  and specific nutrients and reduced form at certain points in the season, there's a coherence  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:21):**  there.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:22):**  It comes together.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:23):**  And I just get such a kick out of observing how healthy plants are not as attractive to  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:32):**  insects.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:33):**  That doesn't mean that sometimes certain fruit eating pests need to be dealt with.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:38):**  And I might utilize the kaolin clay in that case.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:42):**  There are instances where things like Japanese beetle or marmorated stink bugs, a little  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:50):**  bit more of a complex situation.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:52):**  And well, we're humans.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:54):**  We're supposedly call ourselves the most intelligent species on the planet.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:08:58):**  So our job is to think and come up with trap crops and ways where we can redirect an insect's  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:05):**  energy so we can achieve what we want to achieve.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:08):**  So that's what I mean by the complexity of it.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:11):**  But in truth, as you start to think this way and you become observant to how nature does  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:16):**  its health, I think it all kind of comes together and makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:22):**  And it's a real enjoyable way to grow fruit.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:25):**  Definitely.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:26):**  I think that it's a much more, I guess, intelligent way of looking at it rather than having to  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:32):**  manage pests through destruction or killing them.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:36):**  You've talked about redirecting their energy.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:39):**  So why don't we just start talking about that.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:41):**  And you give us a little bit of an overview about how you manage pests and pollinators  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:47):**  and how you attract the beneficials while deterring the pests.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:51):**  In that way, you mentioned changing where their energy goes.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:09:56):**  Well, when it comes to beneficials, a big part of that is just, I call it outrageous  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:03):**  diversity.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:04):**  We want all kinds of plants, all kinds of flowers, all kinds of herbs, all kinds of  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:09):**  habitat which is going to generate the space for those beneficials.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:15):**  And the pests are going to come.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:17):**  And in certain cases, I absolutely want beneficials to eat those pests and keep them in balance.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:24):**  I don't want to totally eliminate any one pest.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:29):**  Sometimes I think maybe that way about the round-headed apple borer, but that's my own  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:34):**  special kind of challenge.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:37):**  But I want them there because they're fodder for the beneficials.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:40):**  What I'm seeking is balance, not the elimination of a species, but letting every species have  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:47):**  its niche, but having this balance there that I'm also getting a good crop.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:54):**  We could zero in on any number of pests.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:10:57):**  A lot of the moths are definitely very much knocked back by the beneficial populations.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:03):**  But then when I utilize neem oil as part of my nutritional program, neem, which comes  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:11):**  from the azadirachta tree in India, has long been used in Ayurvedic medicine and Ayurvedic  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:17):**  agriculture.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:20):**  Neem contains these azadirachtin compounds which inhibit the molting cycle of insects,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:25):**  by which I mean the ability to go from develop as an egg into a larva, to develop into a  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:31):**  pupa, to develop into an adult.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:34):**  Neem interferes with that.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:35):**  It doesn't outright act as a toxin and kill the pests, but it basically locks them in  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:41):**  a juvenile phase.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:43):**  So they're not the same challenge.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:46):**  They don't reproduce readily.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:51):**  That in turn allows me to have apples without worms in them.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:11:56):**  But I'm utilizing a natural remedy.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:01):**  I'm using it wisely.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:03):**  I won't apply neem during bloom time because I have bees in those flowers, and they also  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:09):**  have an insect molting cycle.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:11):**  So I don't want to affect that.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:14):**  But all these things come together and working with, again, the nutrients and the herbs and  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:19):**  the biology.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:20):**  And we got to talk about the biology because that gets very, very fascinating.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:27):**  To grow that healthy apple, to grow that healthy piece of fruit.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:31):**  And I think it's quite doable in all the places that we live.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:36):**  Well certainly yours is a fantastic example of that.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:40):**  Let's go into more detail about your biological spraying methods that you use and that you  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:45):**  advocate for on your orchard.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:47):**  And you talked about the neem oil being an essential ingredient for inhibiting the molting  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:51):**  cycle of the insects.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:53):**  What are some of the other ingredients and components in the sprays that you use?  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:12:58):**  So what I call the core holistic spray consists of seaweed extract.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:03):**  So think of that as kind of a mega multivitamin.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:07):**  It also contains cytokine hormones, which has an influence on plant phytochemistry,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:13):**  the plant's ability to resist disease.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:17):**  The holistic spray includes liquid fish, fish hydrolysate, so cold processed fish, which  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:24):**  has those fatty acids and a lot of the enzymes that the microbes will utilize.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:31):**  It contains some variation of organisms.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:37):**  Principally I'm working with effective microbes, which is mostly lactobacilli and yeast.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:44):**  I'm also working with a formulation of the photosynthetic bacteria called Quantum.  
**[0:13:52-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:13:52):**  And it's these combinations of microbes that I spray on the surface of the plant that basically  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:00):**  claim that niche for the good guys.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:03):**  So when disease organisms come, there is not the room to get in.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:07):**  Nutrients have been utilized.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:11):**  Antimicrobial compounds produce antimicrobial compounds to protect their niche, to hold  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:16):**  their niche.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:17):**  So I'm reinforcing that.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:19):**  The difference between we humans and our bodies and a plant out there in the sunshine and  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:26):**  all sorts of weather is the human body offers a fairly consistent ecosystem in terms of  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:33):**  temperature and moisture.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:36):**  And the 100 trillion of organisms that make up each of us carry forward.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:42):**  But out there in the heat and the drought and the acid rain and the ultraviolet light  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:47):**  and the cold periods, colonization on the surface of the plant can drop down to as little  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:54):**  as 2 to 3% of that surface area.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:14:57):**  But when we can maintain it at 70% or more, that's when the niche is protected.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:03):**  So I think that's all pretty cool, but then there's a whole other part of this, and that  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:08):**  is that the microbes interacting on the surface are just like the microbes in the soil food  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:14):**  web.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:15):**  They're not all the same characters, but there is mineralization and assimilation going on.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:21):**  And so nutrients are being passed on to the plant just as a process of microbes doing  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:27):**  what they do.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:29):**  And to move your brain, to move your conception to that level just totally changes the idea  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:38):**  of what we call in farming foliar feeding.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:42):**  What I'm talking about is providing nutrients for the microbes often, which in turn provide  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:48):**  them to the plant and in the assimilable form.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:51):**  And so fatty acids, fatty acids in neem oil, the fatty acids in boronja oil, the fatty  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:15:58):**  acids in liquid fish, I am fueling that dynamic.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:02):**  I am supporting micro health on the surface of the plant, so I have this ongoing colonization.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:09):**  And also what's cool for me is the fact that when sprays drip into the soil, those fatty  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:16):**  acids, they support the sapetrophic fungi and the mycorrhizal fungi in the soil.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:22):**  And just as a counterpoint here, consider the last hundred years we've been focused  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:29):**  in industrial agriculture, chemical agriculture, on the use of fungicides to kill the disease  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:36):**  organism.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:37):**  And we've targeted what amounts to, I don't know, 2% of the fungal kingdom at the cost  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:44):**  of the other 98%, the microbes and fungi that help plants be healthy.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:50):**  And that's like so critical to start to understand.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:16:56):**  And even within that, we can identify the organic mineral fungicides, copper, sulfur,  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:04):**  lime sulfur, but they work in that toxic manner.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:09):**  And I'll use those in a transition scenario with an orchard who's consulting with me as  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:14):**  we work towards restoring health in the full sense.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:18):**  But how wonderful to get to that point where what you're doing is not anti, not taking  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:24):**  out, not allopathic, but instead is supporting the system.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:29):**  Supporting health essentially is holistic.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:32):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:34):**  And what about the kaolin clay spray that you mentioned?  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:37):**  Where does that efficacy come in and what applications is it meant for?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:42):**  So when kaolin clay, which is found in many soils, a fairly benign clay mineral substance,  
**[0:17:52-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:17:52):**  when that's refined down to very small particle size, that can be utilized on plants to specifically  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:01):**  make it less habitable for certain pest insects.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:06):**  So in my part of the world, we deal with something called the plum curcula tail, which is a small  
**[0:18:13-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:13):**  weevil-like insect that will make feeding stings in the fruit and also lay eggs that  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:22):**  cause the fruitlets to abort.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:24):**  So I want a little less of that and a little more fruit to be left untouched and stay on  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:29):**  the tree.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:30):**  And so when fruit set happens, for those couple weeks, I will utilize a clay spray, which  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:39):**  basically lays on the surface of the fruitlets and the stems and the twigs and leaves.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:46):**  The coculea crawls across, picks up the clay particles in its armpits and its nostrils  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:52):**  and its eyeballs.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:53):**  It just gets irritated, doesn't want to be there.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:18:55):**  And I work with providing unscrayed habitat where they can go do their thing in some wild  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:01):**  trees.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:03):**  Sometimes I utilize trap trees where I draw the coculea away from where I'm growing the  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:09):**  crop, but then I put the chickens underneath.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:12):**  Now I've concentrated a vector, so to speak, where coculea goes up and down from the soil,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:18):**  the chickens find them, and I lessen the pressure for the future.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:22):**  This clay is probably even more of this clay is used in the western United States to deal  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:27):**  with overheating and sunburn issues by whitening the surface of the plant.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:34):**  And then there's other examples of the clay.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:37):**  But I'm kind of targeting the specific moment when damage happens so there's less of it.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:44):**  And I can go further with that with the idea of trap trees and alternative places for them  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:49):**  to go so that I am growing a crop.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:52):**  So that's kind of a pretty benign approach to getting the job done.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:19:56):**  I also use some biological toxins that work against coculea.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:02):**  I'm talking now of a soil bacteria that's fermented to produce spinosad.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:10):**  There's another biological product here in the States called Venerate.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:15):**  And now I'm lessening the pressure, the clay helps weaken the beast, so to speak.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:22):**  And so some of them are going to be taken out by that biological toxin.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:28):**  Which does kind of verge me back into allopathy, but it's a lot more benign and not impacting  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:35):**  other things the way chemicals do.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:38):**  And it seems to me like all of these spraying regimes are dependent on having an intimate  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:44):**  knowledge of the breeding cycles of different pests, but also the fruiting cycles of your  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:49):**  trees, and just generally being in tune as to what's going on on a more macro level of  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:55):**  your orchard.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:20:56):**  Yeah, I think it's worth pointing out here that fruit trees are in the ground 12 months  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:02):**  of the year.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:04):**  And so they're subject to a series of events, so to speak, that your red beep or your radish  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:12):**  or your leaf lettuce, which is in the garden for 30, 60 days and then harvested, doesn't  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:19):**  see.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:20):**  So there's a complexity to this.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:23):**  And the holistic sprays, basically what I'm doing with the nutrients in the biology is  
**[0:21:29-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:29):**  I'm beefing up that competitive colonization, but I'm also stimulating the immune phytochemistry  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:37):**  of the tree within.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:40):**  And the impact of that, the effect of that lasts very strongly for seven days, quite  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:48):**  likely is still going strong at 10 days.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:51):**  You can stretch it to like 14 days when the disease pressures are a little bit less.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:21:57):**  But that basically gives you a rhythm to what I'm doing, that every seven to 10 days, and  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:02):**  there's some variations in different points of the season, I am out there making a spray  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:07):**  application of nutrients in biology.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:10):**  And then the insects, which are very site specific, you have to learn what's my challenge  
**[0:22:16-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:16):**  here at my site, do I have this insect to even begin with, that's added onto that framework.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:25):**  I have a website, Oliver, it's groworganicapples.com, and on there, there's newsletters.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:33):**  And I believe it was the June 2018 newsletter that people will find my updated overview  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:41):**  of that holistic spray program, give them a sense of what is the timing and some of  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:47):**  the why's behind it.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:50):**  That's a good resource.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:51):**  I'll definitely make sure to link to that in the show notes for this episode to point  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:54):**  listeners that way.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:22:56):**  Now, before we kind of move to a different topic, I'm interested to know what you think,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:00):**  or would you consider that a sprayer, either large or small, is an essential tool for growing  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:07):**  apples at production volume, or does this apply to many other fruits as well?  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:12):**  Is it a critical way of interacting with the trees, or is it something that you could get  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:17):**  around in other ways?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:19):**  One of the things I like to point out about a sprayer, a piece of equipment that allows  
**[0:23:25-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:25):**  us to spray, quote, things, unquote, is that it's just a tool.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:32):**  And it's what we put in that tool to spray on the trees, where the perception of spraying  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:37):**  is a bad thing comes in.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:39):**  So for me, the sprayer is a way to deliver nutrients and biology.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:43):**  And I go out, I'm not in a Tyvek suit, rather, I'm singing and I'm happy and I'm interacting  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:50):**  with the birds and the trees.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:52):**  It totally changes the perspective of that.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:55):**  Now, is spraying essential?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:23:58):**  I will point out that with the holistic sprays, it's not just the fruit trees.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:03):**  I'm out there applying to my berries.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:07):**  I spray our potatoes, our tomatoes, our garlic.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:10):**  It's just good for many, many things.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:13):**  And they're all plants.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:15):**  They all have a phytochemistry to help resist disease, and that can be suppressed or that  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:20):**  can be boosted.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:21):**  They rely on a team of microbes to help make their, protect their niche, which in turn  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:29):**  protects the plant, like in the case of potato, from lake blight.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:33):**  So the relevance goes far across the board in terms of all the types of growing that  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:39):**  we do for food and for landscapes and what have you.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:43):**  So for me, in that context, the sprayer is how I go about making that happen.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:50):**  And whether it's a hand-pumped backpack sprayer that a home orchardist would be using, I have  
**[0:24:57-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:24:57):**  a 100-gallon sprayer on the back of my three-point hitch of my 35-horsepower tractor.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:05):**  And there's certainly much bigger sprayer units.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:09):**  We can find the right scale to work with what we're doing where we are.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:15):**  And we could also talk about all these spraying materials.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:20):**  I buy things kind of in bulk on the basis of stocking the pantry.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:25):**  And you'll also see products where everything's mostly premixed, so to speak.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:31):**  But you can do many nutrients, brews with herbs that grow in the place that you live,  
**[0:25:40-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:40):**  i.e. do fermented plant extracts of things like nettle and comfrey to boost calcium levels,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:48):**  fermented plant extracts of horsetail and nettle when it goes into seed to help boost  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:53):**  silica levels.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:25:55):**  I love this concept of plant medicines for plants, so to speak, boosting the health aspect.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:02):**  And once I've done those brews, I get them on the trees with a sprayer.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:07):**  So again, the sprayer as a tool, not as a demonic instrument.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:13):**  It can be, depending what you put in that sprayer.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:16):**  But you put good stuff in there.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:18):**  It's not really any different than your favorite hoe or your favorite scythe or the other tools  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:24):**  that you use to work in your land.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:26):**  Yeah, that's a really good way of putting it.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:29):**  In trying to make parallels with other things that we do, it seems like a lot of the nutrition  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:35):**  that you're giving through these sprays is not so much like dealing with illnesses or  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:42):**  pest attacks as an emergency countermeasure.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:45):**  But most of it is geared towards a preventative nutritional and health measure so that it  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:53):**  doesn't get to the point where it requires an emergency response.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:57):**  No, you're right.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:26:59):**  And I fairly quickly draw parallels between our own health, human health, and plant health,  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:07):**  the health of our agriculture.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:08):**  And we all evolved here on this precious planet.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:12):**  And we have kind of the same rules.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:14):**  We have an immune system, white blood cells, and all that.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:20):**  And that's dependent on good nutrition to be functioning fully.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:24):**  Same for plants.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:25):**  They don't have the white blood cells, but they have these phytochemicals, the flavonoids  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:30):**  and the terpenoids, the phenols, that in turn are how they resist disease organisms.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:36):**  And when a system is robust, that system can deal with environmental reality.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:44):**  It isn't as attractive to the pests.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:47):**  Disease is going to happen.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:48):**  The question is, is there a fertile ground for that to take off, or is this a place that's  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:54):**  so healthy the disease organism will be rebuffed?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:27:58):**  And so it is very preemptive.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:00):**  It's, again, like our own lives.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:03):**  We eat well, we sleep well, we deal with the stresses in our life.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:07):**  We have a much bigger leg up on the situation than if we're downtrodden.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:15):**  And being healthy is no guarantee that something doesn't happen.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:20):**  Things can happen.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:22):**  But when they do, you might reach for a more allopathic method to deal with it.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:30):**  That's true for our health.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:32):**  That's true for how we do agriculture.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:34):**  But you want to not go there to as great of an extent as possible.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:39):**  Far better to do things healthy.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:41):**  Yeah, I think those words ring really importantly for the health crisis that we're going through  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:47):**  at a global scale right now as well.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:50):**  And I'm seeing sort of a pattern for what you've been talking about, from diversity  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:28:55):**  in the insect world to balance in a healthy way the pests and the pollinators, beneficial  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:00):**  insects with the ones that might cause damage, and then with the nutrition cycle and the  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:06):**  different elements that you're using as a spray to promote overall health.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:10):**  It's a very diverse range of compounds and ferments that promote all different types  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:17):**  of life and function in the orchard.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:21):**  Let's talk now about the importance of diversity in the orchard system at the plant kingdom  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:26):**  level and some of the polycultures that you've personally found success with in your orchard.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:32):**  I guess I'll point to three layers here, three ways of thinking about this.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:38):**  One is simply having all kinds of flowering plants means nectaries habitat for beneficial  
**[0:29:47-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:47):**  insect adults whose eggs, larvae are laid on pests and consume those pests.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:29:56):**  But you don't have that latter step without providing that tiny flowers, the sweet sicily,  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:02):**  the valerian, the buckwheat, all sorts of flowering plants to provide that habitat for  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:08):**  beneficials.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:10):**  So that construct is a little fairly easy for many of us to grasp.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:16):**  We can see it, we see the flowers, we see these tiny little repounded wasps and the  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:22):**  hovering ciphat supplies.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:24):**  And as you start to learn about each one, you see how they help you with specific situations  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:29):**  in your orchard.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:31):**  Then another kind of plant in this grouping are the deep-rooted, broad-reaching rooted  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:40):**  massive plants, things like comfrey.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:46):**  Even rhubarb can be in this association.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:49):**  What I like about these plants around the drip line of trees is, burdock is another  
**[0:30:54-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:30:54):**  one in this group, is that this massive plant up top shades a fair amount of ground.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:02):**  It has big roots, but between those roots there's lots of room in the humus for apple  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:09):**  fruit tree feeder roots to get nutrients.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:12):**  So they provide kind of a shading, a protection, while at the same time through their own roots  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:18):**  drawing nutrients up to the surface, comfrey is known as a calcium accumulator among other  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:23):**  things, which when that plant breaks down in the fall, whether it's mowed or just winter  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:29):**  comes on, that nutrient is now brought up from the subsoil to the surface.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:35):**  And that's also good for feeder roots to have access to that kind of thing.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:39):**  And then the third category I want to point out here is going to take us into the realm  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:45):**  of mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:48):**  So mycorrhizae are species of fungi that made an agreement with plants going way back millions  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:31:57):**  and millions and millions of years ago to not cause a problem, but rather form a symbiotic  
**[0:32:04-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:04):**  relationship where the fungi get photosynthetic sugars for energy from the plant and in trade  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:12):**  bring the plant nutrients from a much vaster reaching mycelium.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:17):**  So 90 some percent of the plants on our planet have this affiliation.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:23):**  So we want that, but then there's a cool distinction.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:27):**  And that cool distinction is that the trees of the forest, whether hardwood or softwood,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:33):**  they affiliate with what are known as ectomycorrhizae, ECTO.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:38):**  And that means that the fungal mycelium doesn't actually penetrate into the cells, but it  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:44):**  surrounds the root.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:47):**  And that particular ectomycorrhizae, again, are affiliated with the forest.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:54):**  They have fruiting bodies.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:32:55):**  If you're a gourmet mushroom hunter, you know about the leets and motsusakis and morels.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:01):**  Well, they're all affiliated with specific trees.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:04):**  And in the garden, whether we're talking tomato plants or garlic or we go to the pasture and  
**[0:33:10-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:10):**  talk forage plants, clovers, legumes, grasses, or we go to the berries or we go to the fruit  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:18):**  trees, they're affiliated with endomycorrhizae.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:24):**  And they form in that work, and that's also bringing in nutrients.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:26):**  And in between the two are what are known as the so-called soft hardwoods.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:33):**  Talking now about things like willow and alder and popple, and there's a number of plants  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:39):**  like that.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:41):**  They actually bridge these two mycorrhizal systems.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:45):**  And by bridging this ECTO with the endo, they become a conduit for nutrient sharing on a  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:51):**  much faster scale.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:54):**  And one of the cool things about ectomycorrhizal fungi is their hyphae can reach as much as  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:33:59):**  12 feet down, and they actually work with bacteria to dissolve bedrock, which makes  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:05):**  more nutrients available to bring into the surface.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:09):**  That happens for forest trees, but it's only through these bridge trees, the alders, the  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:14):**  popples, the willows, that you create a place where that deep reservoir of nutrients can  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:21):**  be brought up and go on to all the endo-type plants.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:25):**  I'm throwing a lot of concepts at you here, but the basic idea is when you have willow  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:31):**  and alder and plants like that in the vicinity of what you're growing, you have these bridge  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:37):**  trees, and that adds to the nutrient crescendo.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:41):**  It's really cool that we're alive in this time where we have electron microscopy and  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:47):**  we can start to really understand some of what's taking place when we create what I've  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:54):**  called outrageous diversity.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:56):**  Yeah, very well said.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:34:59):**  I think we live in a fascinating time too, that this type of information is available  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:05):**  even if you don't know how to use those microscopes, and it's sort of disseminated in a democratic  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:10):**  way that allows growers to make use of it rather than just at the higher up ends of  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:16):**  formal education.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:18):**  With that understanding of the species and how they interact in your orchard and the relationships  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:24):**  that form for the benefit of the whole, let's kind of zero in on your orchard species specifically  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:30):**  because that's what's needed for production and income for the most part.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:35):**  Talk to me a little about how you select the right tree species for your climate and your  
**[0:35:40-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:40):**  land while balancing what variety will bring a good return at the market.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:47):**  So I'm one of those people who happens to have a deep addiction to the wide varieties  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:57):**  of apples.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:35:58):**  I'm growing about 120 varieties here.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:02):**  And over time you see a certain variety doesn't do quite so well.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:06):**  You have your hardiness ratings.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:08):**  I am not in a place where I can grow peaches.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:12):**  I can plant peach trees, but every three winters or so the temperature drops down 30 below  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:18):**  Fahrenheit and that's just not going to work for a peach tree.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:22):**  So I never get to the point where I can grow peaches.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:25):**  Yeah, maybe in ten years things are going to change and I'll be growing mangoes and  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:29):**  papayas in northern New Hampshire, but that's another story line.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:33):**  But the knowledge base of which are the right plants for where you live, well nursery people  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:43):**  have some of that information.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:45):**  You talk to neighbors, you learn, oh this tree did so great for my grandparents and  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:49):**  then you graft it and you bring it into your collection.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:52):**  And what I do here marketing wise, it's not on the wholesale level.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:36:58):**  I'm selling directly to people who come from the local community and maybe from downstate  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:06):**  to our farm, to our barn for the three day fall weekends.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:10):**  And I have samples of different varieties out and talk about the lore, the stories of  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:16):**  some of those apples make it all very much alive.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:19):**  We also grow a handful of pears.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:22):**  We have pie cherries for ourselves.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:23):**  I love cherry pie.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:25):**  You can't do without that.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:28):**  We have the northern Asian American hybrid plums.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:31):**  That's the plum that will work this far north.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:35):**  But in terms of figuring out what's the right thing for where you grow, that information  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:43):**  is out there from nursery sources and that hardiness zone aspect.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:47):**  Then there's also the passion for each fruit that you want to grow.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:52):**  If you don't really care for a certain fruit, don't grow that.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:37:58):**  Grow something that excites you, that you're passionate about.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:02):**  But the big point is to start to recognize how that fungal ecosystem is so important  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:09):**  to woody perennials that give us fruit.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:12):**  And that is what is going to determine your success.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:16):**  And as you start to grow fruit that people want to eat to the core because it's so tasty,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:23):**  it's so amazing, there's so many flavors in these different apple varieties, so many textures,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:29):**  then you just see how it comes together.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:33):**  And yes, I have certain varieties I grow more of and there are a few local food hubs I sell  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:39):**  during the week.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:41):**  They don't get the whole monty.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:43):**  They don't get the 120 varieties, but there are a dozen or so varieties, apples that do  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:49):**  really well here and are really distinguishable in terms of their color and the intensity  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:56):**  of flavor.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:38:57):**  Things like Sweet 16, another apple I gave a name to, we call it Bonkers.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:04):**  There's another apple that I've recently been working with and I just planted 10 more trees  
**[0:39:10-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:10):**  of this that I've given the name Red Delirious, which is very much a counterpoint to Red Delicious.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:18):**  And it has depths of flavor like a fine Merlot wine.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:22):**  It's amazing.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:24):**  So yeah, you grow things, some work, some don't.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:28):**  That helps you kind of narrow it down.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:31):**  Then you figure out, this is an apple I want to, or a particular fruit variety I want to  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:37):**  grow more of because it's really a success in the type of marketing that I'm doing.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:42):**  And you add and build up that part of your planting.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:47):**  But it's a process.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:48):**  It's an organic process of seeing what works well and what customers are amazed by and  
**[0:39:56-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:39:56):**  what kind of sits aside and maybe you shouldn't plant quite so much of.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:03):**  And you kind of made a little joke earlier about maybe being able to grow papayas and  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:07):**  mangoes in northern New Hampshire at some point.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:11):**  But at a more serious level, do you think that the shifting climate zones should be  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:16):**  playing a factor in how people decide to plant at this point?  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:23):**  What I'm seeing with the climate and the changes that are going on, like here I am.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:30):**  We're talking on May 20th and my apples aren't in bloom yet.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:36):**  This is a very delayed season.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:38):**  We've had a cold spring and that's happened in the past.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:42):**  But it isn't so much always about warming.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:44):**  It's about erratic.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:48):**  That notion of the polar vortex coming down in the winter, what was delayed until like  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:52):**  late April, early May?  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:40:56):**  Half of me, growers have lost their fruit because the trees couldn't handle that kind  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:03):**  of cold when in bloom.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:04):**  Where my buds were still in the tuck, I got through that.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:07):**  Things are looking quite good.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:10):**  On the other hand, we also have warmer falls.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:14):**  That means that I have a longer harvest window, a longer ripening window.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:19):**  So I can grow some of the later varieties that 30 years ago when I was first planting,  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:24):**  I wouldn't have really thought it wise to put too much into apples like Baldwin and  
**[0:41:30-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:30):**  Northern Spy, classic American keepers, just because I wouldn't have a long enough fall  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:38):**  for them to fully tree ripen.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:40):**  Now it's a given, it almost seems.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:42):**  And then of course you have these erratic events.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:44):**  You have big wind storms and hail storms.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:47):**  And we've always seen some of that, but now they're not quite as erratic.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:50):**  They're almost like, oh, we can count on this happening once or twice in the season.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:54):**  How do we get around that?  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:56):**  How do we plan for that?  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:41:57):**  How do we deal with that?  
**[0:42:03-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:03):**  One strategy, and I think it's a valid one, is outrageous diversity with respect to what  
**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:10):**  we grow.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:11):**  Don't just focus on apple.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:13):**  Mix it up because some years one variety may be really great.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:17):**  Another year, it'll be the other variety that's really great.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:21):**  Cover your bases, have some berries.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:23):**  And I know that makes things a little bit more complex, but it also helps create that  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:29):**  local food system, that local farm that's producing so many things.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:34):**  And there are changes because the summers are warmer.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:38):**  We are about to finally warm up here.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:41):**  And it's going to be in the 80s in about several more days and bloom will start happening.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:48):**  Well, there's a bacterial disease called fire blight.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:51):**  And fire blight looks for an opportunity, which is represented by that open flower,  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:42:57):**  to get into the vascular system of the tree.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:00):**  And so I have to be more aware of if the conditions are right for that disease, I better get out  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:06):**  of extra microbes on those flowers that I might have sprayed a pink, but now I've opened.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:11):**  And that opened blossom is virgin territory.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:14):**  I want to get good microbes in there.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:17):**  If it's not in the 80s, if it's still cool, I don't think about that.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:20):**  But those are some of the perspectives.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:23):**  You have to broaden to what's changing, what maybe now is a challenge I have to be aware  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:29):**  of if conditions are right.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:31):**  So all of that, it's an art.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:34):**  It's an art and a science to grow good food.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:37):**  And when you embrace both aspects of it, you can figure it out.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:43):**  Sure.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:44):**  I mean, that's good encouragement just as an approach for life, pretty much.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:49):**  But you mentioned bringing in this extra diversity in your crops as a resilience method, the  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:43:55):**  different types of trees, factoring in berries, these things that go well together.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:00):**  Do you find that there's a certain point where diversity is a drawback for the business model  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:05):**  where you're just, you're not specialized enough to be able to have either some sort  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:09):**  of efficiency of production or harvesting method?  
**[0:44:12-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:12):**  Or is it really just a matter of your business model needing to reflect a more diverse planting  
**[0:44:18-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:18):**  along with the orchard management?  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:21):**  No, the two are very much related.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:24):**  Marketing and your cropping plan have to have some correlations.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:30):**  So when I spoke of people coming here and tasting my apples, but that doesn't happen  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:36):**  in the supermarket.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:39):**  If you can get a decent wholesale price, and that is a big question, versus what you can  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:44):**  get retail or working through a local food hub who's not quite as cutthroat as a big  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:50):**  supermarket chain.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:44:53):**  Even for there, like I mentioned, I have 10 or 12 varieties that I grow more of, recognizing  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:00):**  that that's a good outlet for that.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:03):**  For me, another part of this is the value added side.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:07):**  So to squeeze fresh juice, what we call sweet cider in the United States.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:13):**  I've had various operations, farm operations, marketing setups over the last 30 years.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:22):**  And I'm reestablishing the cider mill aspect of our farm.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:26):**  What we used to have in that regard was leased.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:29):**  And I'm forming a membership only cider club.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:36):**  And the idea here is that people are helping to purchase the infrastructure by virtue of  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:44):**  which that whole question of pasteurization doesn't come into play because it's people's  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:50):**  cider.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:51):**  I'm merely growing the apples and pressing them, not selling juice per se.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:45:56):**  I'm doing kind of an end around on bureaucracy, which is totally modeled on what's been done  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:03):**  here with raw milk.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:05):**  People buy a share of the cow.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:07):**  It's now their cow.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:08):**  They're entitled to drink their cow's milk.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:11):**  I'm modeling that same idea.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:15):**  We do another variation of apple juice when we boil it down by seven parts.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:27):**  And what's left behind with the pectins, sets and gels.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:31):**  We call this cider jelly.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:33):**  And that's part of the plan too.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:36):**  It's not all just are you selling fresh fruit.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:38):**  And now maybe you're opening yourself up to marketing through the mail.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:44):**  It can get too complex.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:47):**  You got to keep it in balance.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:48):**  I agree with your question there.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:50):**  Like you have too many irons in the fire.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:53):**  Is it working out?  
**[0:46:55-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:46:55):**  But you definitely need several irons in the fire to deal with the erraticness of the climate  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:02):**  and also build up more of a retail base that's effective.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:07):**  We're quite rural.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:11):**  It's not necessarily easy for people to come here regularly.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:15):**  But when they do, I sure as heck want to have a good array of products so that they are  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:20):**  buying more than just $10 worth at a time.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:23):**  It's just like oh, I got to have this.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:25):**  I got to have this.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:26):**  I got to have this.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:27):**  But yeah, even in that, you definitely need to find balance as well.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:31):**  Certainly, yeah.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:33):**  And I've heard this echoed by so many other producers and growers who are at the top of  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:38):**  their game who I've either interviewed or researched myself.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:41):**  And they say a lot of the same things.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:42):**  I mean, one of Joel Salatin's approaches is it's much easier to sell $1,000 worth of products  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:50):**  to 100 people than $100 worth to 1,000 people.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:47:55):**  And by having that diversity of products, you can really create loyal customers that  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:01):**  know that your place is a one-stop shop for a certain category of goods.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:06):**  It seems like if you start with kind of a flagship enterprise, you can move from there  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:12):**  to build on complementary enterprises that make sure to utilize any waste products or  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:17):**  to recycle any other things and add diversity into your offerings to the clients so that  
**[0:48:22-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:22):**  you kind of end up creating this robust business model over time but that you do it little  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:28):**  by little so that you don't sink or get in over your head from the very beginning.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:34):**  This is a new idea, a new venture of what I'm doing.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:38):**  So in fermenting cider, alcoholic cider, I have carboys in fermenting tanks.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:50):**  And the lees, the leftover spent yeast at the bottom of the tank is something you always  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:55):**  just – I might have given it to the chickens just down in the compost.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:48:59):**  But it finally struck me that lees are filled with yeast and they also have a very strong  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:06):**  lactobacilli content.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:09):**  And I'm now brewing my lees like the mother culture I've gotten from companies for effective  
**[0:49:15-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:15):**  microbes.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:16):**  And this is a trial, but it's just like, why not?  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:20):**  These are my very own yeast.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:22):**  These are the yeasts that live here and work here.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:25):**  And I can replenish those populations and my holistic sprays from the waste product  
**[0:49:30-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:30):**  of something I do as part of my marketing plan.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:35):**  It's all pretty cool.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:37):**  I call them effective cider microbes.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:39):**  Nice, nice.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:41):**  Man, that sounds like some delicious products coming up.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:44):**  And this must be kind of a later succession as you've had more of your plantings from  
**[0:49:49-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:49):**  earlier years come into production and increase what you can offer as even byproducts or value-added  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:56):**  products from the apples.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:49:58):**  What's that saying about when was the right time to plant fruit 20 years ago, plant a  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:04):**  tree 20 years ago?  
**[0:50:07-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:07):**  It takes some time.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:09):**  This is not an instant plan.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:13):**  I used to supplement my income by doing a lot of carpentry off the farm.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:19):**  And it's nice now to have enough going on here at the farm that that part is gone.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:25):**  And my wife Nancy has plenty of carpentry projects for me as it is.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:30):**  But you build into it, you grow into it.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:34):**  Just as the tree develops limbs that can hold the weight of a fruit crop, you develop your  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:40):**  marketing ideas and the niches and the season where you can have time for this crop or that  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:47):**  crop.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:48):**  Probably one of the most profound pieces of advice I could give is do what you do at the  
**[0:50:57-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:50:57):**  right scale so that you do it right.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:00):**  Having 100 things where everything is behind is not happy.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:05):**  Having 10 things that you've kind of worked out the sequence and you can get it done in  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:10):**  time and done right is happy.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:13):**  Yeah, that's fantastic advice that applies to so many things.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:16):**  Now there's one more aspect of your orchard management that I'd like to explore.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:21):**  Could you tell me about the method of weed and overgrowth control that you manage with  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:25):**  what you call biological mowing?  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:29):**  So human construct of mowing is going to be as basic as the lawn.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:35):**  We don't want things too high and we don't want dandelions and et cetera blooming out  
**[0:51:40-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:40):**  there with this grass.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:43):**  The biological construct of mowing has to do with what are the roots of the crop plant  
**[0:51:49-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:49):**  doing in terms of interacting with other plants, in terms of the mycorrhizal network, and how  
**[0:51:57-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:51:57):**  can I maybe pulse the nutrient flow to the crop that I'm growing when it's most needed.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:03):**  So apples and pears, the palm fruit offer a great example of this.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:09):**  So apples and pears go into bloom and right after bloom for about three weeks or so, they  
**[0:52:19-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:19):**  essentially stop elongating their shoots and the plant as a whole directs its photosynthetics  
**[0:52:27-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:27):**  the sugars produced through photosynthesis.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:30):**  A good two-thirds of those sugars are traded with the biology down below.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:35):**  And when plant growth is not robust up top, that means that something's happening in the  
**[0:52:41-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:41):**  root zone.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:42):**  And this is the point in the season, I call it the spring feeder root flush, when the  
**[0:52:47-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:47):**  little feeder roots are coming off the year-round root system to gather nutrients to grow this  
**[0:52:54-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:52:54):**  year's crop and also to form, to provide the nutrients to form flower cells for next year's  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:01):**  crop.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:02):**  So when I come around my trees right at the tail end of bloom and side down the swath  
**[0:53:08-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:08):**  of grasses and flowering clovers just in that zone of the drip line and under the tree,  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:16):**  for the most part, I leave certain plants grow, what I'm doing is shocking the root  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:21):**  systems of those plants that grow near the fruit tree just as the fruit tree is putting  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:27):**  out these feeder roots, which in turn means more of the pulsing of the nutrients is going  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:33):**  to go through the mycorrhizae to the apple tree, to the pear tree.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:38):**  And eventually the understory plants recover and grow again, but this means right at that  
**[0:53:44-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:44):**  kind of critical time, the spring feeder root flush is all the more successful in getting  
**[0:53:50-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:50):**  what the fruitlets need to develop and putting effort, energy into the development of flowers  
**[0:53:56-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:56):**  for next year.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:53:58):**  So my whole mowing scenario is based on essentially seeing what's going on underground and how  
**[0:54:05-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:05):**  my impact of that sharp side blade helps my apple trees in turn grow better fruit.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:11):**  All this coming back to that acute awareness of the processes that nature is going through  
**[0:54:17-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:17):**  and the stages of growth of all of your plants.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:19):**  I think it's a beautiful way of interacting with that ecosystem in really taking the time  
**[0:54:26-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:26):**  to understand what it's going through and when and what actions or interventions are  
**[0:54:32-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:32):**  going to help give it the next kind of bump up in the step of succession and the step  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:38):**  of growth and the step of health that it's wanting to get to naturally.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:42):**  No, no, I agree.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:44):**  Sometimes it's incredibly complex, but it's breathtakingly beautiful.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:49):**  A very elegant relationship.  
**[0:54:53-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:54:53):**  As we plug into understanding these things, it makes obvious the timing of going out and  
**[0:55:02-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:02):**  cutting the grass around the trees, the timing of boosting the phytochemistry when certain  
**[0:55:08-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:08):**  diseases are at their most prominent moments, recognizing when a particular rain event brings  
**[0:55:16-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:16):**  that threat of disease much more so and being preemptorily prepared beforehand.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:23):**  It does all come together and then you see less problems, you see more health and that's  
**[0:55:30-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:30):**  so satisfying.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:34):**  Sometimes that saying about you get 50 shots in a lifetime to do something and every spring  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:40):**  is one of those shots and it's like, I want to learn so much more.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:44):**  I want more than 50 chance.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:49):**  With that said, what advice would you give to listeners who are thinking about starting  
**[0:55:53-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:53):**  their own orchard?  
**[0:55:54-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:54):**  What are some of the most important things to consider in your opinion?  
**[0:55:58-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:55:58):**  When I do a site consultation, I will talk about the lay of the land, different orchard  
**[0:56:07-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:07):**  systems, how there's different rootstock size trees, what that requires, but I'll also talk  
**[0:56:12-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:12):**  about the marketing piece.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:15):**  What are your intentions?  
**[0:56:16-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:16):**  What are your plans?  
**[0:56:17-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:17):**  Where's room for growth, but let's not necessarily grow there all at once.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:23):**  Let's recognize it's going to be a process.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:26):**  You need to get your hands in the dirt and you need to actually work with a tree, observe  
**[0:56:32-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:32):**  it through the seasons, work with the berry planting, go see other farms, see how they've  
**[0:56:38-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:38):**  done things.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:40):**  It's through experience, it's through the eyes that observe that you'll learn the nuance  
**[0:56:47-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:47):**  that'll make you successful.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:50):**  It's an education, it's an internship.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:56:54):**  One of my sayings is when we plant trees from a mail order nursery, it's bare rootstock.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:01):**  If it's a one year nursery tree, it's probably a whip.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:05):**  Doesn't even have any branches yet.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:07):**  Then I look out at the class I'm teaching and I say, some of you out there are whips.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:14):**  You're just starting.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:16):**  Just know that there's a few years here to grow that branch structure, to learn the pieces  
**[0:57:21-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:21):**  that you need to have to be successful at this.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:26):**  There's a relaxation in that.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:28):**  It isn't like you have to grasp it all at once.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:31):**  It begins by getting your hands in the dirt and just giving thanks for being on this planet,  
**[0:57:36-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:36):**  being alive and being able to work with green plants and grow healthy food.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:41):**  I love that message.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:44):**  Before I let you go, Michael, can you tell us where people can find your books, The Holistic  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:49):**  Orchard, The Apple Grower, as well as your online resources like you touched on earlier?  
**[0:57:54-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:57:54):**  The website is groworganicapples.com.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:01):**  All this effort, The Holistic Orchard Network.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:06):**  People who are growing fruit for their community are plugged in.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:09):**  There's articles about various aspects of growing that are there for free in the biological  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:16):**  curriculum.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:18):**  There's research updates.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:20):**  We have a grower's forum.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:23):**  Anyone can read that forum.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:25):**  I try to keep it to more of a community orchardist perspective.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:33):**  But whether you're a home orchardist or a community orchardist or even a larger scale  
**[0:58:38-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:38):**  grower trying to break away from the chemicals, I think there's much inspiration to be found  
**[0:58:44-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:44):**  there.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:45):**  Of course, there's a bookshelf.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:46):**  The Holistic Orchard is there and Apple Grower.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:50):**  Mycorrhizal Planet, that's my fungal book that came out in 2017.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:58:56):**  That's a way that people can buy direct from the author.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:00):**  That's nice.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:01):**  It's kind of like supporting your farmer at the local food farmer's market.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:05):**  It doesn't work necessarily through the big corporate chains or the online booksellers,  
**[0:59:10-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:10):**  but that's how you can connect with me directly.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:13):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:14):**  I'll be sure to link to all of those resources in the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:19):**  Michael, it was such a pleasure to talk to you.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:22):**  Thank you so much for taking the time with me today.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:24):**  I totally enjoyed it.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:26):**  I'm glad we got the connection in place and we could share about plants and healthy soil.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:31):**  Yeah, it was a little touch and go there for a minute, but we made it work.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:34):**  Thanks for your patience.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:35):**  That's great.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:36):**  Yeah, let's keep in touch.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:38):**  I look forward to connecting with you again in the future.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:40):**  All right.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:41):**  Thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:42):**  All right.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:43):**  Take care.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:44):**  Bye.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:45):**  Bye.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:46):**  Bye.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:47):**  All right.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:48):**  That wraps things up for this week's episode.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:49):**  If you enjoyed this interview and want to find more like it, as well as articles and  
**[0:59:52-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:52):**  other resources, you can find the full library of previous podcasts at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=0:59:57):**  The best part is that you can search by category, topics, or keywords on our brand new website  
**[1:00:02-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=1:00:02):**  rather than scrolling through more than 140 interviews.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-phillips/#t=1:00:06):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 11 Sep 2020 07:45:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:40):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:49):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:18):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:20):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:24):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:39):**  Alright everybody, welcome back.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:41):**  Now as we continue into this series on waterway regeneration, I reached out to Judah Schwartz,  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:47):**  a wonderful author who tells stories to explore and illuminate scientific concepts and cultural  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:52):**  nuance.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:53):**  Now today we'll be talking about her two most recent books, Water in Plain Sight and  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:01:58):**  The Reindeer Chronicles, both of which feature incredible case studies of the importance  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:03):**  of a healthy water cycle to the health of our ecosystems and global climate regulation.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:08):**  Now Judith is known for taking a clear-eyed look at global environmental, economic, and  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:13):**  social challenges, and finds insights and solutions in natural systems.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:17):**  She also writes for numerous publications including The American Prospect, The Guardian,  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:22):**  Discover, and Scientific American.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:25):**  In this interview, Judith begins by explaining some essential information on the water cycle  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:29):**  beyond just the simple rain and evaporation rotation that we all learned in grade school.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:34):**  She also walks me through the ways that it interacts with plant life to affect the rainfall  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:38):**  of an area and to hydrate the land.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:41):**  Now from there we explore some of the incredible examples of ecosystem regeneration that she  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:45):**  highlights in her books, and we even get into some of the mind-expanding questions that  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:50):**  you can use to re-evaluate your own understanding of the potential of your own regenerative  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:54):**  projects and dreams at the end of this episode.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:02:58):**  Beyond just the clear information of water's hidden functions in the global ecology, Judith  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:03):**  is a great storyteller and helps to connect the hard facts with the personal and intimate  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:07):**  side of these projects and journeys.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:09):**  So put your mind in imagination mode and I'll hand things over now to Judith.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:13):**  Hey Judith, thanks so much for taking the time to be here.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:16):**  It's great to finally get to talk to you.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:17):**  I've been following your work for a while and I've been looking forward to this for  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:21):**  a little bit.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:22):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:23):**  I'm doing great.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:24):**  So look, one of my favorite things that I know from your work and some of the talks  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:28):**  that I have listened to in the past is that you're very good about changing the emphasis  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:34):**  on part of the climate discussion towards where it should really be, which is the water  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:39):**  cycle rather than all this focus just on the carbon cycle.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:44):**  Can you tell us a little bit about the importance of the water cycle in climate regulation to  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:48):**  start us off?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:50):**  Right.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:51):**  So, you know, we've just, when we talk about climate these days, it's just what immediately  
**[0:03:57-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:03:57):**  we go to, our conversations go to is the carbon cycle, is the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:06):**  However, if you step back a bit and pose the question, how does the earth manage heat?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:15):**  What we get to is all kinds of different water-based processes.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:21):**  So anyway, I'll just start off with a quote that I think is so revealing from an Australian  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:29):**  farmer, author, all around maverick named Peter Andrews.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:35):**  And he's written a couple of really fabulous books called Back from the Brink and Beyond  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:40):**  the Brink.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:42):**  And from an Australian perspective, but there's so much that all of us can learn.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:47):**  Okay.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:48):**  So what he says is plants manage water and in managing water, they are managing heat.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:56):**  Okay.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:04:57):**  I love that because it's kind of like a haiku.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:00):**  But if we kind of unpack that a bit, basically what I learned through writing Water in Plain  
**[0:05:08-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:08):**  Sight, the book about water, is the extent to which plants are driving the show.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:17):**  Plants are moving moisture, directing moisture, transforming moisture from water to vapor,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:28):**  which is in itself a cooling mechanism and therefore is central to water, to climate  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:35):**  regulation, temperature regulation.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:38):**  So the main, so in that book, Water in Plain Sight, my goal was to look at water as a verb,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:48):**  as opposed to water as this thing that we want, we need.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:52):**  Maybe you have water, I want water.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:55):**  Maybe we fight about it.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:57):**  Maybe we pipe it here or there.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:05:59):**  But how water works.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:03):**  And a couple of processes that are really important, that have everything to do with  
**[0:06:08-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:08):**  the regulation of the climate, are transpiration and condensation, and also infiltration, which  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:17):**  allows for those other processes to occur.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:20):**  So basically transpiration is the upward movement of water through a plant.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:28):**  A plant pulls water from the roots, uses it and its metabolism and all its other functions,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:38):**  and releases moisture into the air.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:42):**  This is a cooling mechanism.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:44):**  Since it's a cooling mechanism, it is consuming heat and taking that solar radiation as it  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:06:55):**  hits the ground and dispersing it into the atmosphere at a higher level.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:03):**  So when you walk into a, let's say, all right, I'm here in Vermont looking outside, okay,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:11):**  a meadow, when, okay, you've got two bits of ground here.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:17):**  There's a meadow and there's a sidewalk.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:21):**  When you, in a hot summer day, your feet want to be on that meadow for many reasons.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:27):**  It's cooler partly because of the coverage, but also because of the transpiration that's  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:32):**  happening, that it's the ambient coolness is a result of that.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:39):**  Whereas the solar radiation, the sunlight, when it beams on that sidewalk or even more  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:46):**  so dark asphalt, the solar radiation has no place to go but right there.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:52):**  It kind of sits there and it heats it up.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:07:55):**  Whereas the solar radiation in a meadow is that heat is being continually transformed  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:03):**  and released in a latent form in the vapor.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:08):**  So you have more coolness.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:11):**  So the water cycle is working and cooling.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:15):**  And so this is even more of a factor in forests because when you have trees, trees are larger  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:24):**  and they're working with more water.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:27):**  They're transforming more water.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:30):**  And that has the collective transpiration of trees means not only more cooling but also  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:38):**  more movement of moisture.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:41):**  So trees are pulling in the moisture.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:46):**  That's a phenomenon known as the biotic pump.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:51):**  And they're releasing moisture and that moisture is moving elsewhere.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:08:55):**  So when we think of rain, how do we get rain, often we think about the large water cycle  
**[0:09:05-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:05):**  which is from that moisture moves from large bodies of water, the ocean and then you get  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:15):**  clouds and then it turns into, then you get rain.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:18):**  But when you pose the question, how does that moisture get inland?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:25):**  Here I am in Vermont.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:26):**  It's not near the coast by any means but we get plenty of rain.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:30):**  It's because of the forests that are pulling the moisture in.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:35):**  So plants are working all the time directing moisture, pulling moisture in and it's really  
**[0:09:44-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:44):**  important for climate because embodied in that moisture is tremendous solar energy,  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:55):**  radiation and heat.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:09:58):**  It's conveying heat through the atmosphere.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:02):**  There's a botanist named Jan Pecorny who has said that evapotranspiration and the evapopart  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:11):**  added to the transpiration of plants refers to also the evaporation from the surrounding  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:17):**  soil.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:18):**  But that is the largest mover of energy on earth.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:25):**  So it's an invisible process but a really meaningful process.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:31):**  Yeah, yeah definitely and that puts it in perspective really well.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:35):**  And it kind of goes against perhaps what a logical way of thinking is that you know plants  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:42):**  bring up water through their root systems and they extract water from the soil, from  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:48):**  wherever they happen to be and this puts them more in an active role of creating water resources  
**[0:10:54-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:10:54):**  and can you talk a little bit about how healthy plant ecosystems can actually increase the  
**[0:11:02-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:02):**  rainfall in areas that they affect as an overall pattern facilitated through this evapotranspirative  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:11):**  process.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:13):**  Right yeah it's a really interesting thing that we can think about plants as a kind of  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:18):**  pump.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:20):**  So they're pumping carbon down into the soil and they're pumping water up through the roots.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:28):**  Yeah so I'm trying to zone in on one of the many examples that I've seen.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:34):**  Okay so I'm going to settle in on, I know the way I'm talking it's almost like you know  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:40):**  I've got a globe spinning and I'm going to point my fingers.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:43):**  So I'm thinking about Chihuahua Mexico.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:47):**  Alright so this is an area, a large grassland ecosystem much of which is desertifying and  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:11:55):**  some of which is also being intensively farmed through industrial practices which is having  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:12:03):**  some really intense impacts on this on this land.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:12:08):**  And for people's references this is the province that's like right below Texas and New Mexico?  
**[0:12:15-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:12:15):**  Right in Arizona and it's the largest state in all of Mexico and yeah so it's vast yeah  
**[0:12:24-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:12:24):**  and yeah so it's a big ranching culture and there are ranchers that practice holistic  
**[0:12:35-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:12:35):**  planned grazing which is following on Alan Savory's work and other people there are you  
**[0:12:43-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:12:43):**  know various kind of schools within the holistic planned grazing network and so they are working  
**[0:12:51-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:12:51):**  with their cattle in a way that mimics the behavior of large herds of bison and and bighorn  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:02):**  sheep and other animals that had always been not only on that landscape but helping to  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:08):**  create that landscape.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:11):**  So mimicking the the natural grassland ecosystem so and and now employing the cattle as vehicles  
**[0:13:23-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:23):**  for restoring that landscape in addition to being a product in and of themselves in for  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:31):**  grass fed beef.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:33):**  So I went down to Chihuahua Mexico a few years ago because I learned about collaboration  
**[0:13:41-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:41):**  between the bird conservation organizations and these holistic ranchers and I thought  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:50):**  that was really interesting because certainly back then now it's more known you didn't think  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:13:55):**  about these two factions as having much in common but as it turned out the areas that  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:02):**  were were managed this way had tremendous bird populations whereas in much of the region  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:09):**  the the numbers had been had plummeted sometimes down to 80% and these bird conservation organizations  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:16):**  based in the US had assumed that it was that there were problems in the they were looking  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:21):**  at the the summer this migration up up in the Great Plains but then they realized that  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:27):**  these birds were spending seven months of the year in the Chihuahuan desert grasslands  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:34):**  and those grasslands were disappearing.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:37):**  So they then work saw that where these ranchers were that the birds were very happy and it's  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:44):**  really interesting to understand how how how these synergies work because the birds like  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:51):**  a kind of mosaic so so with different levels of grasses and that's something that these  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:14:58):**  ranchers can emulate and what they what the birds had been used to before humans came  
**[0:15:06-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:15:06):**  in and and changed the landscape were these large kind of grassland systems with small  
**[0:15:14-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:15:14):**  natural and confined burns some are you know lightning burns so yeah now driving around  
**[0:15:27-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:15:27):**  that area as I did with these ranchers I saw just like really dry desiccated barren landscapes  
**[0:15:39-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:15:39):**  and then you go to their ranches and there is an abundance of moisture in the in the  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:15:47):**  you see in the in the rich lush grasses and that's of course reflecting the moisture also  
**[0:15:53-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:15:53):**  in the soil and I remember Alejandro Carrillo he said he laughed when he said that his neighbor  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:16:01):**  said to him well of course your grasses look better you get more rain on your ranch which  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:16:09):**  of course is very amusing because they're only you know like a couple of hundred yards  
**[0:16:14-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:16:14):**  from each other but the point is that when you're able to hold the moisture in the ground  
**[0:16:23-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:16:23):**  you have a lot more water and then if you take it one step further because that moisture  
**[0:16:33-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:16:33):**  is constantly circulating you're also creating the conditions for more rain I mean you know  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:16:43):**  I'm not about to say that he gets more rain than the neighbor but he's certainly creating  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:16:50):**  the conditions for rainfall for the plants to be cycling that moisture and then when  
**[0:16:58-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:16:58):**  there are trees for those trees to pull in that moisture so yeah Alan Savory has a has  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:17:08):**  a line when he always talks about it's not as much rainfall you get you receive that's  
**[0:17:14-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:17:14):**  important but whether that rainfall is effective and I also saw in spending time on that ranch  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:17:24):**  kind of the many levels in which this works so one of the reasons one of the things that  
**[0:17:30-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:17:30):**  I was exploring down there was the role of the connection between water and biodiversity  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:17:38):**  and the story that I expected to tell and certainly was able to tell is that when the  
**[0:17:44-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:17:44):**  water cycle is functioning better that you have greater biodiversity and that makes sense  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:17:51):**  you're able to support more species you don't have areas that are desertified and cannot  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:17:57):**  support plant and animal life that you have more insects and more butterflies and all  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:18:03):**  of that and birds of course and all of that proved to be true but what I didn't expect  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:18:09):**  to find and I thought was really really interesting was the impact that biodiversity has on the  
**[0:18:16-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:18:16):**  water cycle and that's something that I saw there that the greater the biodiversity you  
**[0:18:25-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:18:25):**  have the more effective the water cycle can be because you have all these different creatures  
**[0:18:33-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:18:33):**  from prairie dogs to earthworms to dung beetles to all these little insects and soil microorganisms  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:18:42):**  that haven't even been labeled that they're all moving through the ground creating large  
**[0:18:49-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:18:49):**  and small spaces for water to be meander through and because the water is slowed down it lingers  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:18:59):**  longer in the landscape so that was really interesting.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:04):**  Yeah that's a fantastic example that really illustrates the points of not only how the  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:08):**  water cycle is working in that area and can perhaps be restored but how all of those pieces  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:14):**  are connected in the holistic aspect of the climate and the ecosystem that they're working  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:19):**  with and now we've talked about you know a positive example of how this is starting to  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:25):**  improve we also have a better understanding because of your explanation of how the entire  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:30):**  cycle works in relation to climate moderation but can you tell us some of the main things  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:36):**  that are starting to well not starting to but have already broken the water cycle at  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:42):**  key points or have damaged it in some way that it cannot function the way it's supposed  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:47):**  to and is kind of creating these sort of run-on or perhaps domino effects later down in the  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:53):**  ecological food chain.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:19:56):**  Right okay well there are many factors one is paving over soil so just I mean the extent  
**[0:20:06-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:20:06):**  to which our planet is being paved over and built upon is really really huge and anytime  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:20:18):**  you like I'm just looking around my house okay when you build a house you have altered  
**[0:20:25-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:20:25):**  the water cycle and that's just a house think about every road every parking lot every highway  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:20:34):**  you're altering the water cycle on many levels first of all when the water hits that spot  
**[0:20:41-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:20:41):**  that's one thing and also how the water flows so every road is not just a conveyor for traffic  
**[0:20:51-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:20:51):**  or for foot you know for people to walk upon that is also a waterway and it was really  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:20:59):**  interesting when I when I visited a couple in far west Texas and they had a huge area  
**[0:21:07-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:21:07):**  of land that they were working with and Catherine Ottmers who was one of Catherine and Marcus  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:21:15):**  were my guides there he was their land and Catherine observed that there was a recent  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:21:21):**  rain and she saw that because the road was angled a certain way that it caused more erosion  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:21:28):**  than had the road been angled a slightly different you know just we're not always thinking about  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:21:34):**  the water cycle in our built environment okay so so building over land is one way that we  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:21:41):**  have had a negative impact on the water cycle another is through deforestation and that's  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:21:48):**  large scale but also small scale every time you're cutting down trees you are changing  
**[0:21:55-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:21:55):**  the water cycle and that's been huge here in Vermont so originally Vermont was forested  
**[0:22:04-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:22:04):**  then in the 1800s it was largely deforested because of the wool trade and that completely  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:22:14):**  altered the water cycle and that gave us the wonderful phenomenon that we know now know  
**[0:22:19-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:22:19):**  as mud season because trees hold the soil trees slow down the movement of water trees  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:22:29):**  are the basis for whole ecosystems the synergies of which also manage the way water flows across  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:22:35):**  the landscape so that's really important in another way that deforestation and the removal  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:22:41):**  of of plants or the covering up of plants has an impact on the water cycle I learned  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:22:48):**  about in when I was reporting this recent book so I went to Spain and spent three days  
**[0:22:55-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:22:55):**  with an extraordinary scientist named Mian Mian who was the director of an institute  
**[0:23:07-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:23:07):**  about the the environment of the Mediterranean and what he has been documenting over time  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:23:15):**  is the change in the rain patterns in that region so he's based in Valencia and so this  
**[0:23:22-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:23:22):**  is the western Mediterranean area and starting in the 1980s there were several years of data  
**[0:23:30-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:23:30):**  about rainfall that did not fit the norm and he studied this and basically in the past  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:23:39):**  there had been regular summer rains that every day it would be in the summer it would be  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:23:46):**  really hot then you would watch these clouds move in you'd get a sudden downpour and then  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:23:53):**  the air would clear and be cool and it was predictable and the farmers knew that they  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:23:59):**  could depend on this rain and then things changed and what Mian Mian found is that this  
**[0:24:07-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:24:07):**  was associated with the cutting down of trees in the area and the paving over of soil and  
**[0:24:19-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:24:19):**  the and plants due to it being a very appealing area for tourism and for people to live in  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:24:29):**  because it's right on the coast so you know hotels and all this other these other aspects  
**[0:24:35-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:24:35):**  of development and also in the marshlands they started to drain them and farm so all  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:24:43):**  of those things changed the water cycle and what he learned and I think this is really  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:24:48):**  really interesting if you start to think of how this can apply to other areas is that  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:24:54):**  in terms of the concentration of moisture needed to produce that rain he learned that  
**[0:25:01-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:25:01):**  the moisture coming off the Mediterranean was never enough that the moisture from the  
**[0:25:09-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:25:09):**  Mediterranean that you know movement of vapor was always picking up additional moisture  
**[0:25:17-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:25:17):**  from the trees and the marshland plants and that was sufficient to make a rain but when  
**[0:25:27-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:25:27):**  the land was covered over the trees were taken down and the wetlands were drained and different  
**[0:25:36-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:25:36):**  plant regimes were there there wasn't enough so I just think the whole concept of what  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:25:43):**  do you need to make a rain is kind of an interesting way of thinking about it but that insight  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:25:50):**  is really powerful because those dynamics are occurring all over the place and also  
**[0:25:57-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:25:57):**  he says and this is a really really you know serious scientist who you know who marks his  
**[0:26:08-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:26:08):**  makes his words very carefully that by strategically reforesting and revegetating the region we  
**[0:26:19-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:26:19):**  can bring back rain now it doesn't mean that you're snapping a finger and it's going to  
**[0:26:27-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:26:27):**  go back to the way it was as he says you may plant and then get rain 75 kilometers to the  
**[0:26:35-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:26:35):**  south down downwind but that it can be done and I think considering that is I think it's  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:26:44):**  worth considering that very seriously as we think about how we can restore our ecosystems.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:26:52):**  Yeah absolutely and I remember reading that passage in your book and how relevant it is  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:26:57):**  to where I live now I'm only about three hours drive north from Valencia I've been down there  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:02):**  a couple of times and I haven't heard the same talk about how those rain patterns used  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:07):**  to come into the summer obviously we're just coming out of the summer now but I would imagine  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:12):**  that the same sort of macro climate would be fairly similar in this area and has also  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:20):**  suffered from a lot of deforestation and development along the coast of the Mediterranean because  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:24):**  the Barcelona area is also you know quite a hot spot for tourism and it makes me wonder  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:30):**  obviously I haven't lived here for very long but if there were similar weather patterns  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:35):**  that have changed since then certainly a lot of other people have spoken about how you  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:41):**  know snow cover doesn't come nearly as often or stick around as long in the winter time  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:46):**  and I'm just starting to sort of get my bearings in a new place but you know if these opportunities  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:51):**  are there if there's the potential to start to reforest and reinstitute or regenerate  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:27:57):**  the ecosystems that provided these essential services it seems like there's an obligation  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:03):**  for people who are aware of this to start to try and move these initiatives forward.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:09):**  Right and one factor there I mean I think it's worth mentioning that Mián Mián is  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:14):**  in his late 70s and so people who are much younger than him may not know what the land  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:21):**  was like I mean there's so many examples I see this all the time when I'm reporting that  
**[0:28:27-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:27):**  when like undessertified landscapes or landscapes that have various kinds of challenges that  
**[0:28:35-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:35):**  many people just assume that it's always been that way so that kind of collective memory  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:43):**  isn't always there so just a really powerful example of that was when I was visiting in  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:50):**  Chihuahua and Alejandro was taking me around these different areas and he would look at  
**[0:28:57-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:28:57):**  I'd see he'd show me just a vista of you know all like it's just eroded and maybe a few  
**[0:29:06-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:06):**  little mesquite plants but mostly kind of rocky and bare and to me that's just what  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:14):**  it looked like and one could only assume it was always that way and he said when I was  
**[0:29:20-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:20):**  a child this was the best land with the best grass so you know having that memory I think  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:29):**  is important because it's so easy just to assume you know that that's just the way it  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:37):**  is and therefore always will be.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:41):**  Yeah no I agree that's one of the saddest parts of all of these things that are happening  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:44):**  now is that my generation included but ones younger than me as well and I guess even older  
**[0:29:49-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:49):**  ones have no reference as to what a healthy and truly abundant state of their area as  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:29:57):**  far as ecological health even looks like because we don't have that reference anymore and in  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:02):**  a lot of cases it wasn't well preserved like before we started to damage these places we  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:07):**  didn't even have the recording equipment whether it be cameras or video to hold on to a record  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:14):**  of what was there and I've you know I've done quite a bit of reading in the last year that  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:18):**  talk about what the plains in the United States look like and even certain species that have  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:23):**  gone extinct that even now would seem totally unfeasible there were species of birds that  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:31):**  were so numerous that you know you sometimes think of flocks where they kind of look like  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:35):**  a cloud and they kind of move in unison almost like a school of fish but in the air and there  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:41):**  have been species like that that were completely wiped out of the continent and just aren't  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:46):**  there anymore and without that kind of reference of knowing like this was a very very different  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:51):**  place before we started to interact and develop quote unquote the way we are now it gets difficult  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:30:58):**  to give a reference as to what it is we're trying to restore right and that's that's  
**[0:31:03-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:31:03):**  one reason where you know I always come back to the importance of imagination we need to  
**[0:31:10-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:31:10):**  be able to imagine what it was like in the past and using the tools of archives and books  
**[0:31:18-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:31:18):**  and photographs but also that that can serve to help us imagine what can be because imagining  
**[0:31:28-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:31:28):**  what is possible helps lead us there because if we don't think it's possible well you know  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:31:37):**  what can where are we going to go with it yeah absolutely and so we gotta kind of look  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:31:44):**  into some of the biggest causes of the damage and who are some of the culprits in this issue  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:31:51):**  of water cycle health now I know that the biggest consumer of water as an industry is  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:31:57):**  the agricultural one but I'm really glad that you sort of put a highlight on industries  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:32:03):**  that don't necessarily consume water actively as still becoming barriers to the health and  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:32:08):**  the proper functioning of the water cycle can you talk about some of the biggest barriers  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:32:14):**  that we have and that we need to start to dismantle in order to reinstate the health  
**[0:32:19-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:32:19):**  of this system well I would say rethinking agriculture is huge and I think that well  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:32:31):**  okay so I mean that's such a huge topic but in terms of the water cycle I think we really  
**[0:32:39-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:32:39):**  need to look at irrigation very very seriously because irrigation you know we I guess to  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:32:49):**  some extent it is necessary but how we do it is important but also to understand that  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:32:55):**  irrigation does not come without costs okay there's obviously the cost of of using water  
**[0:33:02-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:33:02):**  in situations where you may be using water up I mean we all know about the Ogallala reservoir  
**[0:33:10-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:33:10):**  which is being tapped and we know about in places like the Central Valley of California  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:33:21):**  where we're using up groundwater and we're getting subsidence but not many people know  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:33:26):**  that in Saudi Arabia you know which we know of as a you know very dry desert area that  
**[0:33:33-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:33:33):**  there has been there's a lot of fossil water that was used to grow wheat and that has been  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:33:41):**  largely used up and so where does that end up anyway just speaking of Saudi Arabia I  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:33:48):**  hope this isn't too much of a tangent but just I found very powerful the way that Neil  
**[0:33:53-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:33:53):**  Spackman a practitioner who's done an incredible project there how he made it a priority to  
**[0:34:02-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:34:02):**  not overdraw the water bank to collect water but never to use more water than he collected  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:34:12):**  because that ethic is not present in our agricultural system I mean the fact that we're overdrawing  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:34:19):**  water all over the place is just you know I mean it's it's asking for trouble the other  
**[0:34:25-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:34:25):**  thing with irrigation is that you end up with a lot of kind of hard water you know you get  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:34:34):**  a lot of mineral deposits and salinity and the only way to deal with salinity in the  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:34:41):**  soil is to kind of flush it out with more water so irrigation comes with lots and lots  
**[0:34:46-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:34:46):**  of costs but yeah the scale of the agriculture that we're doing is really asking us to mistreat  
**[0:34:57-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:34:57):**  our water supplies and a more decentralized, regionalized, localized, focusing our production  
**[0:35:07-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:35:07):**  that way well not only will it help us manage our water better but also give us greater  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:35:15):**  food security because we saw with the beginning of the the COVID crisis how our supply chains  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:35:23):**  our global supply chains were not as robust as we thought they were and they were only  
**[0:35:28-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:35:28):**  able to get them to be more solid by you know I would say asking the impossible of food  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:35:36):**  workers and farmers and you know certainly people in meatpacking plants and you know  
**[0:35:42-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:35:42):**  putting people at risk and yeah no so for many many many reasons it's really important  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:35:51):**  that we relocalize our food supplies and food our food production.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:35:58):**  Yeah I totally agree and I'm really glad that you use the example of Neil Spackman's work  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:02):**  in Saudi Arabia I've had him on the podcast twice now and I'll definitely refer, listen  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:06):**  there's here to check out those previous interviews if you want to hear more in depth about his  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:10):**  project but your profile of him in the book The Reindeer Chronicles is a really good write-up  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:15):**  and summary of his project and what he's been able to achieve there and to further expand  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:21):**  on what you're talking about with the irrigation that he was using to get the trees established  
**[0:36:25-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:25):**  in an area of runoff in order to collect the water that came from the mountains above and  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:33):**  they were actually able to collect more water once the plants were established than they  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:37):**  ever had used in the irrigation process kind of throwing the preconceived notion that when  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:44):**  you have plants in a parched area that all they do is use up more water but by managing  
**[0:36:50-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:50):**  the landscape correctly by harvesting rainwater and even having the plants there created more  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:36:57):**  of a resource than it actually extracted and it just starts to show the potential of understanding  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:03):**  an entire ecosystem rather than breaking it down into basic components.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:08):**  Right yeah no that's such a powerful story and so important that we understand the capacity  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:15):**  well I guess that's the name of your podcast to create abundance rather than working from  
**[0:37:21-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:21):**  the scarcity mindset which creates fear and that scarcity mindset I think drives our current  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:31):**  agricultural system because it's kind of like we better use up this groundwater while we  
**[0:37:37-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:37):**  have it as opposed to how can we build our water resources because agriculture is working  
**[0:37:44-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:44):**  with plants and we know that plants can create manage and regenerate moisture so the answer  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:52):**  is right before us it's just a matter of figuring out in each context what's the best way to  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:37:58):**  make it work.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:00):**  And so I'll ask you now to give me another example from your book and specifically the  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:05):**  one on the lowest plateau which I believe illustrates really well of similar project  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:10):**  as to that of Neil Spackman and the al-beta project in Saudi Arabia but predates it a  
**[0:38:15-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:15):**  bit with John D. Liu's documentation of the effort in China to rehabilitate the land of  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:22):**  the lowest plateau and restore it to health.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:24):**  Can you give me a profile on that?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:27):**  Sure yeah no this is kind of like the big you know granddaddy of ecological examples  
**[0:38:34-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:34):**  of contemporary ecological restoration so the story here is that this is the lowest  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:43):**  plateau is it's a pretty large region and it is the it was for many thousands of years  
**[0:38:50-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:38:50):**  the breadbasket of China and it is where agriculture developed in China around the same time as  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:39:00):**  it did in the in the Fertile Crescent so you know we've been going for 10,000 years here  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:39:07):**  in this land and the land is getting degraded the quality of this particular ecosystem is  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:39:14):**  that it's lost soil which is fine powdery soil it's mineral rich soil it's actually  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:39:21):**  the same kind of soil that you have in Iowa I remember the first time I ever saw the word  
**[0:39:28-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:39:28):**  loss which I think is how you pronounce it is was when we were living in Iowa and took  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:39:35):**  our son to the museum and anyway I'm just laughing now because it was many years before  
**[0:39:40-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:39:40):**  I wrote a book about soil and the whole exhibit was about soil so so this powdery soil it  
**[0:39:49-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:39:49):**  it drifts so when you lose the you know when the the land degrades the the soil you know  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:00):**  silt it silted up the Yellow River which was causing a problem and it was and they were  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:06):**  getting a lot of erosion and basically the land was desertifying and losing all this  
**[0:40:13-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:13):**  soil and I mean by the time I guess by let's say that the 1970s 80s all people were unable  
**[0:40:24-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:24):**  to feed themselves they were really unable to to grow to grow food they had their animals  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:32):**  their wealth was their animals and they were they had been I guess you know like what often  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:37):**  happens in these kinds of situations is that the agriculture moves from the riverbeds up  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:42):**  to the hillsides and then when you when you start denuding the plant life on the hillsides  
**[0:40:48-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:48):**  you get erosion and all of that was happening and in John's documentaries you see people  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:40:56):**  going up taking their goats up the hills and maybe there's a few tufts of grass that these  
**[0:41:01-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:41:01):**  goats are eating and yeah it was really really bad so the so the Chinese government in conjunction  
**[0:41:09-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:41:09):**  with the World Bank and other entities decided to restore this area to rehabilitate this  
**[0:41:18-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:41:18):**  degraded landscape which was really a very bold effort and they brought in hydrologists  
**[0:41:27-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:41:27):**  geologists biologists chemists economists lots of economists and they developed a program  
**[0:41:37-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:41:37):**  and which you know was fairly simple one big factor was was kind of gating off penning  
**[0:41:47-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:41:47):**  the animals you know I know in in most contexts that's not a very good practice but it was  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:41:56):**  important to allow that land to recover from the constant overgrazing so that was one thing  
**[0:42:02-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:42:02):**  they did they terraced the land so that the water slowed down and stayed in the soil and  
**[0:42:11-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:42:11):**  they did lots and lots of planting they planted trees they planted other shrubs and anyway  
**[0:42:20-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:42:20):**  it worked and the land where the animals had been started to recover and there's some wonderful  
**[0:42:28-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:42:28):**  wonderful footage that that John has in which through kind of time-lapse showing you know  
**[0:42:37-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:42:37):**  stringing together the footage from 1995 and 2009 you can actually watch that land go from  
**[0:42:49-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:42:49):**  like you know it's just down to the bones of the earth it's just you know totally bare  
**[0:42:57-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:42:57):**  and barren to all green and yeah and no one really imagined I mean they had the plans  
**[0:43:09-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:43:09):**  but I think that the what the result exceeded their what their best hopes and what's interesting  
**[0:43:18-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:43:18):**  is that it was only by accident that John actually got that footage because he got to  
**[0:43:26-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:43:26):**  know Jurgen Vogelie who was the director of the project through the World Bank and through  
**[0:43:35-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:43:35):**  their children their their their children went to school together and they you know  
**[0:43:43-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:43:43):**  Jurgen casually asked John just to take a few pictures and John said that he you know  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:43:51):**  just on his own he wouldn't have thought that this would be very interesting but it's only  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:43:56):**  in retrospect when you see the tremendous changes and so that record is so valuable  
**[0:44:01-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:01):**  and of course that changed John Lew's life tremendously because he says that once you  
**[0:44:09-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:09):**  know that it is possible to rehabilitate large-scale damaged ecosystems well then you are virtually  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:19):**  obliged to do it if we know that we can do it we sort of have to do it because this is  
**[0:44:26-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:26):**  repairing the earth this is giving the possibility of meaningful lives to millions of people  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:35):**  I mean literally millions of people were brought out of poverty and that's a big important  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:40):**  part of that project as well is that it has had a big economic impact on that area and  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:45):**  I know that some people criticize this type of ecological work saying well it's you know  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:50):**  it's gonna cost all this money and we don't know exactly how we're gonna make our money  
**[0:44:53-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:44:53):**  back and look at it in the kind of these reduced business type of evaluations but the economic  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:01):**  productivity has also really improved from that area and people who are farmers there  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:07):**  have more than doubled their income since these changes and restoration techniques have  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:13):**  been implemented right right I mean they're able to support themselves and then you know  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:20):**  had yeah in a band in a way that they hadn't before I mean these are people who were living  
**[0:45:25-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:25):**  in caves and the stories that were told at that time beforehand of grandmothers refusing  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:35):**  food and dying so that they could be sure that there was food enough for the children  
**[0:45:40-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:40):**  in the extended family I mean this is poverty like I don't think many of us can even imagine  
**[0:45:48-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:48):**  and and meaning in life I mean the pride that we all have I mean this is universal in in  
**[0:45:56-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:45:56):**  sustaining ourselves in being productive in creating abundance and creating beauty because  
**[0:46:05-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:46:05):**  it's a lot more aesthetic and I mean what can be more meaningful than restoring the  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:46:13):**  land in which you live you know another point that John makes that I think is really powerful  
**[0:46:19-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:46:19):**  because often we you know when we're looking at numbers and you know and numbers of hectares  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:46:25):**  and this and that you know we're not always thinking about the the human side but what  
**[0:46:30-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:46:30):**  John says is that you know our landscapes are a reflection of our consciousness and  
**[0:46:40-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:46:40):**  I think that is really powerful because if we're suffering can we create an abundant  
**[0:46:50-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:46:50):**  aesthetic landscape but also if we're living in a desertified non-productive kind of you  
**[0:47:03-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:03):**  know wound of a ecosystem wounded ecosystem can we feel whole I think that we really neglect  
**[0:47:12-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:12):**  the profound connection that we as humans have with our landscapes that's really well  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:19):**  said and it's something that I connect with deeply too has been a big motivation in getting  
**[0:47:24-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:24):**  me into this line of work and you know like you mentioned earlier with how John felt transformed  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:30):**  by seeing that this was possible and how it completely changed the trajectory and the  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:35):**  dedication of his life it's actually had a direct impact on me because he went on to  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:39):**  found the ecosystem restoration camps nonprofit and I now work as the ecosystem restoration  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:45):**  coordinator for that organization and am helping to work with the camps all around the world  
**[0:47:51-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:51):**  to find and design the correct implementation for their own pieces of land and it's amazing  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:47:59):**  to see how you know an inspiring project like that can really create the catalyst for a  
**[0:48:05-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:05):**  movement and affect so many people either directly or indirectly and you know I think  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:12):**  that's also something that you do really well in your book is highlight these inspiring  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:16):**  examples of what is possible when people take the time to really understand their context  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:21):**  on a deeper level and put together the pieces whether it's community or governmental or  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:27):**  financing or all of them together in some way to create something that is much larger  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:34):**  than just you know perhaps the economic benefit or perhaps just working to restore the rain  
**[0:48:40-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:40):**  cycle or the fertility to the soil but they all have connections that build upon one another  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:46):**  and that's really where regeneration is possible.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:50):**  That's fabulous I didn't know that you were that you had taken on that role and about  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:54):**  the ecosystem restoration camps you know I just think it's so incredible that when I  
**[0:48:59-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:48:59):**  went to Camp Altiplano in Spain I guess it was gosh not even two years ago that was the  
**[0:49:09-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:09):**  first camp and there were only two at the time and less than two years later how many  
**[0:49:16-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:16):**  are there more than 20 right?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:18):**  We've got more than 20 and we are working on onboarding nearly 30 in the upcoming year  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:23):**  it's really taken off and Sylvia down in Altiplano has been doing amazing work down there too  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:30):**  I was actually in contact with her recently it's something that's growing really fast  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:34):**  and I'm really looking forward to all of the new initiatives that are being onboarded soon.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:38):**  It's so wonderful and I remember back in 2015 at the Paris Climate Summit I was with a delegation  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:47):**  from Regeneration International and we got together with John and he kept talking about  
**[0:49:52-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:52):**  he kept saying let's go camping we need to go camping and it just you know it sounded  
**[0:49:59-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:49:59):**  like oh it's just this thing he's talking about yeah these camps and anyway he did it  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:05):**  he made it happen it was always a good idea but you think like really?  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:11):**  Anyway it's no huge credit to him and there's an amazing team behind that organization as  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:17):**  well and I'm only one of the newer additions but it's really starting to take off and I  
**[0:50:22-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:22):**  mean hopefully these are going to be the projects that end up in the books and the documentaries  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:26):**  and then next couple of years for the successes that they've had in restoring their own places  
**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:30):**  and I really think this is something that's starting to gain steam and really being picked  
**[0:50:35-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:35):**  up as people realize I mean partly because of the pandemic that we find ourselves in  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:40):**  and realizing how closely connected that is with the damaged ecosystems that we've started  
**[0:50:45-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:45):**  to take for granted as if they were just normal as if this is what we were I guess condemned  
**[0:50:53-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:53):**  to live in and there weren't other options but these types of profiles and success stories  
**[0:50:59-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:50:59):**  really fly in the face of that especially when you get into they're not all big budget  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:04):**  projects and a lot of them started with you know gathering a couple of community members  
**[0:51:08-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:08):**  together who decided that they wanted something better and that they were going to start to  
**[0:51:13-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:13):**  look for solutions and get other people to help them and I mean just having a finger  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:19):**  on the pulse of the types of projects that are taking off with that same mentality with  
**[0:51:23-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:23):**  that same motivation is hugely inspiring and work like yours is really propelling this forward  
**[0:51:30-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:30):**  even faster and so before we wrap up here can you tell me a little about a project in  
**[0:51:38-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:38):**  New Mexico that you were able to sit in on where people in a parched area of the state  
**[0:51:45-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:45):**  were conflicting over water resources and the person who helps to come in there and  
**[0:51:52-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:52):**  ask some essential questions that changed how they looked at their situation?  
**[0:51:58-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:51:58):**  Yeah well this is certainly an example of where the state of the land is a reflection  
**[0:52:03-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:52:03):**  of the state of our consciousness so this is a community it's called Cabezon it's actually  
**[0:52:11-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:52:11):**  a ghost town in New Mexico about an hour and a half outside of Albuquerque and there's  
**[0:52:19-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:52:19):**  land that the Bureau of Land Management in the US manages and there are people whose  
**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:52:27):**  families have lived there for hundreds of years and there are ranching allotments and  
**[0:52:33-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:52:33):**  then there's a small little town nearby where people have some homes and so what was happening  
**[0:52:44-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:52:44):**  was there were fights over access to the pump house and all these conflicts emerged over  
**[0:52:54-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:52:54):**  who which whether it's the domestic water board the rancher so the townspeople versus  
**[0:53:01-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:01):**  the ranchers and things got really heated up and there was gunfire and sabotage and  
**[0:53:09-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:09):**  someone got shot and someone broke their arm and it just got really really tense and these  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:15):**  are people whose families have known each other for generations so whereas they used  
**[0:53:20-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:20):**  to have cookouts get togethers all this people then at this point were saying I can't bring  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:28):**  my children around to our land because I don't feel safe there I don't feel they can be safe  
**[0:53:34-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:34):**  there so what was happening is that all these skirmishes and fights and arguments kept erupting  
**[0:53:42-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:42):**  and the Bureau of Land Management kept coming in to try to work things out and it was a  
**[0:53:47-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:47):**  drain on the Bureau's resources and different people were suing each other and I mean it  
**[0:53:56-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:53:56):**  was a point where I think the domestic board was suing the other board but also themselves  
**[0:54:03-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:54:03):**  anyway it was really getting out of hand so as a last ditch effort the BLM hired my colleague  
**[0:54:10-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:54:10):**  Jeff Goble of the Community Consensus Institute and he has this model of deep listening with  
**[0:54:26-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:54:26):**  processes helping groups through conflict usually around land because that is Jeff's  
**[0:54:37-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:54:37):**  background so what he was able to do was over the course of a weekend so people not every  
**[0:54:49-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:54:49):**  so a core group of about 30 people came and I have to say I admire them they took a risk  
**[0:54:59-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:54:59):**  they took a risk to sit down with people they've been arguing with and be honest with the others  
**[0:55:06-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:55:06):**  and with themselves but the key was creating the conditions creating trust among the group  
**[0:55:15-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:55:15):**  that enabled that to happen so over a weekend now in retrospect I could say a weekend is  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:55:22):**  a really short period of time I can be honest and tell you that it felt really slow at times  
**[0:55:28-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:55:28):**  and kind of tedious but that's when you see that that's part of that every piece of the  
**[0:55:38-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:55:38):**  process was important because in retrospect I can see where different community members  
**[0:55:47-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:55:47):**  kind of things clicked for them at different times sometimes it was understanding that  
**[0:55:55-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:55:55):**  the fear of conflict was actually creating the kind of the kinds of negative consequences  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:04):**  that they were trying to avoid by avoiding conflict so different people were kind of  
**[0:56:10-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:10):**  getting it in different ways and anyway through this process the community determined to not  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:24):**  only get past their arguments but to work for the betterment of the land and in the  
**[0:56:29-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:29):**  beginning of the process they weren't even talking about the land everyone was saying  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:33):**  everything we just need to stop fighting we just need and most of the time people were  
**[0:56:37-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:37):**  saying the other side needs to understand needs to listen to me and then we need to  
**[0:56:42-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:42):**  stop fighting and everything will be fine and then people started to understand that  
**[0:56:47-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:47):**  the condition of the land was part of what was leading to their sense of despair their  
**[0:56:54-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:56:54):**  sense of scarcity their ongoing worry and their kind of suspicions of each other and  
**[0:57:04-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:57:04):**  what was really interesting is that while holistic planned grazing was not part of the  
**[0:57:11-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:57:11):**  initial topic it was kind of dropped in there through one little video several of the ranchers  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:57:19):**  have become very very involved in applying that to their own land and in educating others  
**[0:57:26-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:57:26):**  in learning how to better manage their livestock in order to restore the land wow yeah so it  
**[0:57:37-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:57:37):**  was really it was really quite amazing so there's three questions that he asked in sequence  
**[0:57:44-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:57:44):**  that I found were really useful and obviously they are illustrated how they were applied  
**[0:57:50-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:57:50):**  to this disagreement between the ranchers but do you remember those or would you like  
**[0:57:55-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:57:55):**  me to go through them well I think well how do you perceive the situation and how do you  
**[0:58:06-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:58:06):**  feel about it and that's important because not everyone perceives the situation you know  
**[0:58:12-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:58:12):**  you're all sitting in the same in this situation in the same scenario but many people may may  
**[0:58:17-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:58:17):**  perceive it differently and hearing how others see it can in itself be useful then there's  
**[0:58:25-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:58:25):**  what is the worst possible outcome you know and that's the one that throws you because  
**[0:58:32-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:58:32):**  usually you've been doing everything possible to avoid thinking about what it is that you  
**[0:58:38-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:58:38):**  fear but by articulating that it sort of like releases it like and you realize just how  
**[0:58:47-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:58:47):**  much energy you have been devoting to kind of suppressing your fear and then what's the  
**[0:58:56-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:58:56):**  best possible outcome and usually we don't even allow ourselves to think about it because  
**[0:59:04-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:59:04):**  we're so focused on avoiding the worst possible outcome and then the one after articulating  
**[0:59:12-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:59:12):**  the best possible outcome and by articulating it it becomes possible then it's what would  
**[0:59:19-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:59:19):**  that look like and what might it take to get there what might what might you do let's say  
**[0:59:27-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:59:27):**  you can get there what would that look like you know what kinds of changes might that  
**[0:59:34-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:59:34):**  involve and the amazing thing is that when you've articulated what it is that you aspire  
**[0:59:41-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:59:41):**  to and you begin to think of even just one thing that you might do then all these ideas  
**[0:59:51-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:59:51):**  come pouring out and you see that there's much you can do I'll just give you a really  
**[0:59:57-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=0:59:57):**  quick example from Jeff's work that I think illustrates this so powerfully so he was brought  
**[1:00:03-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:00:03):**  in in the 1990s to a region of Mali where in Africa where 12 different tribes were at  
**[1:00:12-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:00:12):**  war with each other and people were starving anyway it was just a it was a mess and he  
**[1:00:18-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:00:18):**  was brought in and he got together with people and he said he asked them what do they want  
**[1:00:25-1:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:00:25):**  and they said we would like to be able to produce more food and he said okay why can't  
**[1:00:36-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:00:36):**  you do this and then he they said you know because people are fighting because the soil  
**[1:00:43-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:00:43):**  is bad because the rains are bad because people are lazy and so then Jeff said okay now that  
**[1:00:50-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:00:50):**  we know it's impossible we'll just accept that it's impossible what if it were possible  
**[1:00:55-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:00:55):**  let's just like take that leap what if it were possible what would you do and then all  
**[1:01:01-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:01):**  these ideas came coming out you know like we would put in cover crops we would manage  
**[1:01:07-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:07):**  our livestock differently we would divide our land so that we have or we would you know  
**[1:01:13-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:13):**  set up structures that we are fighting more and less and that the pastoralists and the  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:19):**  farmers could you know share the land in a different way anyway so so then he came so  
**[1:01:25-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:25):**  then he left and he came back 50 oh and then he said that those are all great ideas do  
**[1:01:31-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:31):**  you think that you can improve your your increase your production 10% and they said yeah sure  
**[1:01:38-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:38):**  how about 20% yeah if we work really hard you know they agreed that they could they  
**[1:01:44-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:44):**  could probably do 20% and then he said how about 50% and they all looked at each other  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:52):**  and they said no no no no that's too much and he said I'd like let's see if you could  
**[1:01:57-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:01:57):**  increase your food production 50% so then he left and 15 months later he came back and  
**[1:02:04-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:04):**  he was on the long road to this village and was still about half a kilometer away when  
**[1:02:12-1:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:12):**  all these people started running up to the Jeep he was in and they were so excited and  
**[1:02:18-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:18):**  they wanted to show him what they had done they had increased food production 78% it's  
**[1:02:26-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:26):**  amazing and you told that story perfectly that's actually exactly what I was trying  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:30):**  to get out when I prompted you with the question and just how powerful these types of questions  
**[1:02:35-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:35):**  that break down pre assumed ideas are the presumptions that we had that things wouldn't  
**[1:02:41-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:41):**  work just because we had thought it up or agreed upon it in our minds and that to me  
**[1:02:47-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:47):**  is is a testament to the power of well-crafted questions at breaking down those assumptions  
**[1:02:56-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:02:56):**  bring you up to take action in a new way yeah and also it's an illustration of how how our  
**[1:03:02-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:02):**  beliefs can limit us and we don't see that because we that's part of our kind of armor  
**[1:03:10-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:10):**  we carry around with us all the time on that note what advice would you give to people  
**[1:03:16-1:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:16):**  who are looking to start a regenerative project or an initiative or something with their community  
**[1:03:22-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:22):**  and are not sure how to go about it or where to begin wow well you said something powerful  
**[1:03:30-1:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:30):**  and that's ask some good questions I would say give yourself a lot of room and you know  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:38):**  now this is something I've learned through holistic plan grazing through holistic management  
**[1:03:43-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:43):**  you know always write your your plan and pencil and then once you've kind of done a round  
**[1:03:50-1:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:50):**  of it then you write it in pen so you can keep records so just know that you're going  
**[1:03:55-1:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:03:55):**  to make mistakes and be and know that you can learn from them don't be afraid of them  
**[1:04:01-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:01):**  I would say yeah think of what's possible and use your imagination yeah use your imagination  
**[1:04:10-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:10):**  as a tool you know not as a kind of avoidance like you know like let's have fabulous dreams  
**[1:04:16-1:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:16):**  so that we don't have to look at the reality but you know as a tool to really stretch yourself  
**[1:04:24-1:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:24):**  and imagine what is possible and learn from these other projects so I've learned so much  
**[1:04:30-1:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:30):**  from podcasts like yours from earth repair radio from there are a lot there are a lot  
**[1:04:37-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:37):**  of them now and all of those stories sometimes it's really really fun to listen to stories  
**[1:04:44-1:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:44):**  from such like you know exotic different parts of the world and it's wonderful to listen  
**[1:04:52-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:52):**  to those in part because you know something can spark what actually makes sense for where  
**[1:04:59-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:04:59):**  you are too that even from the most remote areas we can apply some of those insights  
**[1:05:07-1:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:05:07):**  where we are and I'd say approaching in the spirit of learning and experimenting and observing  
**[1:05:18-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:05:18):**  nature and allowing yourself to to love the land where you are with all of its wounds  
**[1:05:27-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:05:27):**  and all of its hidden pasts and secrets that you come to you come to learn about yeah I  
**[1:05:37-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:05:37):**  think a lot of it is in in the spirit of it I'm not sure if I'm getting at what you're  
**[1:05:46-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:05:46):**  saying but I guess I guess a couple of things when John Liu talks about what are what is  
**[1:05:56-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:05:56):**  the basis of of restoring an ecosystem he says he talks about it as three basic trends  
**[1:06:04-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:06:04):**  rising biodiversity rising soil organic matter and rising biomass so increasing focusing  
**[1:06:18-1:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:06:18):**  on increasing those and those three functions and those of course build on each other and  
**[1:06:26-1:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:06:26):**  those also support the water cycle so working with the water cycle you know understanding  
**[1:06:35-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:06:35):**  how water flows and there are some great resources about that from Mark Sheppard's new book Water  
**[1:06:43-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:06:43):**  for Any Farm and Brad Lancaster's work on rainwater harvesting there are a lot of great  
**[1:06:52-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:06:52):**  examples out there really understanding the water cycle and focusing on that and through  
**[1:07:00-1:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:07:00):**  that focusing on those three factors biomass soil organic matter and biodiversity and even  
**[1:07:09-1:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:07:09):**  if you're if you're not someone I mean if you're someone in like you know a suburban  
**[1:07:14-1:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:07:14):**  area or you know I'm just thinking right here where I am when I had a brilliant water retention  
**[1:07:26-1:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:07:26):**  landscape designer Zach Weiss he came to visit because his family he grew up very close to  
**[1:07:33-1:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:07:33):**  where I am and when he pointed out that the fact that we are here has altered the water  
**[1:07:40-1:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:07:40):**  cycle on the mountain that I live on he said that we all can sort of work to make the water  
**[1:07:50-1:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:07:50):**  cycle even more functional almost like kind of making amends through the through how we  
**[1:07:57-1:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:07:57):**  manage water we can all do that we can harvest the rainwater we can look at the way water  
**[1:08:04-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:04):**  flows and ensure that it's not flowing so fast that we're losing topsoil and causing  
**[1:08:10-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:10):**  damage or or getting water logged elsewhere so we can on any scale we can start to apply  
**[1:08:18-1:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:18):**  these insights.  
**[1:08:20-1:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:20):**  That's wonderful advice I couldn't agree more and you used examples from a lot of my own  
**[1:08:24-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:24):**  favorite references that have been on the podcast in the past I'll put links to the  
**[1:08:28-1:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:28):**  interview I did with Mark Shepherd on the book that you referenced and I actually got  
**[1:08:33-1:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:33):**  one with Zach Weiss coming up during this series I'm not sure if it's going to come  
**[1:08:37-1:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:37):**  out before or after this one but that's something to look out to for listeners and before I  
**[1:08:44-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:44):**  let you go can you tell the people who have tuned in so far how they can find the rest  
**[1:08:50-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/judith-schwartz/#t=1:08:50):**  of your books and get in touch with you and learn more about your work.

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:00:59):**  Hi, I'm Selma.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:02):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:07):**  Thank you Selma.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:08):**  That's my little niece Selma.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:09):**  She just turned four and was very excited to hear her voice recorded.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:12):**  And so I'm on a little family vacation here just before Christmas with my sister and her  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:17):**  two little girls, Selma and Rawan.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:19):**  Rawan is just a little over one years old and has not learned to talk yet, but we'll  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:23):**  get her on an intro soon enough.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:26):**  So now that I had the opportunity to be with family this time around, I'm going to let  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:31):**  my sister, Emily, do the introduction for this podcast.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:35):**  So here we go.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:37):**  We've covered so many different ways to approach reforestation, both with native species and  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:42):**  mixes of natives and orchard trees.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:45):**  In today's session, Oliver wanted to focus on fruit orchards, and he got to speak with  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:49):**  the wizard behind Miracle Farms and the film, The Permaculture Orchard, Stefan Sobkowiak.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:55):**  Oliver has been a fan of Stefan's work for a while, and he spent a lot of time on his  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:59):**  excellent YouTube channel, where he offers tons of tutorials and solutions to practical  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:04):**  aspects of managing a whole ecosystem around his orchard enterprise.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:09):**  In this interview, we break it all down from the beginning, from how Stefan began to look  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:14):**  for land and the challenging climate of Canada, all through his great advice for how to get  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:18):**  started from selecting species, building soil, propagating trees, and growing from there.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:25):**  We also go into how Stefan leverages nature's tools to create a healthy and balanced ecosystem  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:31):**  that not only brings more resilience to the operation, but helps to reduce labor and external  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:36):**  inputs.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:37):**  Towards the end, we also unpack some invaluable advice on how to make money through innovative  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:42):**  marketing strategies so you can make a respectable living on a modest amount of land.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:47):**  We cover a really wide range of topics, and Stefan really knows his stuff, so don't forget  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:50):**  to check out the links in the show notes for this episode, and maybe even keep a notebook  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:54):**  around for good measure.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:56):**  Now let's hand things over to Stefan.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:57):**  Hey Stefan, thank you so much for making the time to be with me here today.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:02):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:03):**  Great, great Oliver.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:04):**  Let's get started.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:06):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:07):**  So I'm a big fan of your work, and I've actually been going back and rewatching the film of  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:12):**  the Permaculture Orchard, which you walk through all of your systems on Miracle Farms, and  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:16):**  I've got tons of questions, as well explained as everything was.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:20):**  So let's start from the beginning and have you tell us a little bit about your personal  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:24):**  background and how you got started in agroforestry.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:31):**  Long circuitous route.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:34):**  I studied wildlife biology, and then I did a masters in landscape architecture.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:45):**  Fortunately in 1990, discovered Bill Malsen's book, The Designer's Manual, devoured it  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:51):**  for three weeks.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:53):**  Got so excited, I realized I had to get started.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:56):**  I had to get planted, I had to get going.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:01):**  Started to look for a place, because we were living in the city, where we still do, but  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:06):**  we were looking for a place to start.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:09):**  And found a little farm after two years of search, so if anybody's ever thinking, oh  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:16):**  yeah, good, I want to get started, it doesn't always happen overnight, so I understand how  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:21):**  sometimes delays.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:24):**  So I bought this 4000 tree monoculture conventional apple orchard that we transitioned to organic,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:32):**  did that for five years, and really came to the conclusion that it wasn't an active and  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:40):**  viable ecosystem.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:43):**  It still was a monoculture, I had to admit that yeah, at that point I had 3000 trees,  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:49):**  because there's a learning curve, so losing 25% of the trees is just par for the course.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:56):**  And got started, got going, and by then I was already teaching in PDCs, and I realized  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:06):**  I was a little bit of a hypocrite, because I would teach people how to set up a permaculture  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:11):**  orchard.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:12):**  I would come into my monoculture organic orchard, and I thought, geez, this isn't exactly what  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:17):**  I'm teaching.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:19):**  So it took a few years, we set up a nursery and replanted the orchard, and then to at  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:26):**  least be able to say that what I'm teaching is what I'm doing.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:31):**  So that's kind of where we got to in a nutshell.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:35):**  Yeah, I think that's a situation that a lot of people can relate to, in that they want  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:40):**  to get started real fast, it ends up taking longer than they thought, and in the beginning  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:44):**  they kind of have to make some compromises from what their ideals are, and kind of balance  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:49):**  things out until they're able to go all in.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:52):**  Now how many acres is Miracle Farms on?  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:56):**  We're on 12 acres, of which we have about 5, 6 acres planted now, or replanted in a  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:03):**  permaculture orchard.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:04):**  We still have about an acre in somewhat monoculture, but gradually transitioning orchards.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:13):**  And so, though you were organic from the beginning, that monoculture put it in contrast to what  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:19):**  you were aiming to achieve.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:20):**  How would you define the difference between a permaculture orchard and how it's different  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:26):**  from a conventional one?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:28):**  Diversity, that's the main thing.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:31):**  We had before, it would be the same species, so it would be all, in our case it was an  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:37):**  apple orchard, but the same thing for pear or plum or peach orchard, whatever.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:41):**  It's always planted as a monoculture.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:45):**  That's the whole ideal of an orchard nowadays, when we say, oh I have an orchard, well you  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:50):**  have usually an orchard made up of the same tree.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:53):**  So the big difference is, we don't have a monoculture to the point where we don't even  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:59):**  have the same species touching two trees in a row.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:03):**  At least that's the goal.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:04):**  We might have a few examples where two trees of the same species touch, but that's not  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:10):**  by design, it just happens.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:13):**  So the idea is that we really want there to be diversity within the row and between rows,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:21):**  so that's the big difference.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:24):**  And we function in a system of trios, so we'll put a nitrogen fixer, which is completely  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:30):**  different from fruit trees, it's a totally different family.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:34):**  And then we'll put either two fruit trees, a fruit tree and a nut tree, or two nut trees.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:39):**  So that's the basis of trios, and it's quite a departure from the monoculture apple orchard  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:48):**  that we had.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:49):**  I would never go back to a monoculture, I may as well just quit, because I've been there  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:55):**  and I definitely don't want to go back.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:57):**  When I hear Mollison in his writings and in his talkings, he says, if you're ever so unfortunate  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:03):**  as to inherit a monoculture orchard, and I get it totally, because it is a misfortunes,  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:09):**  it's, you think, oh, that's great, you know, well, it's not so great.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:14):**  You're better off inheriting a piece of open land than to inherit an existing monoculture  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:20):**  orchard.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:21):**  Because it's far, well, it's far easier to start from scratch, than to undo what's there  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:28):**  to redo what you would like.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:31):**  It's just, it's not as obvious to think, well, I'll just cut some trees down.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:35):**  Well, the tree doesn't want to just die.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:37):**  Even if you cut it down, you would have to cut it and yank your roots out for that tree  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:42):**  to no longer be an apple.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:45):**  And then you have, basically, you know, you'll have trees that are high and others that are  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:52):**  small.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:53):**  So it's harder to restart that way than it is to start from scratch.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:00):**  Having done it, I know that, yeah, it's a lot of work to take out an existing orchard  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:05):**  and then replant.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:08):**  And so it's taken you how long to make this transition to where you are now and how much  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:12):**  longer do you think until you reach the goal that you set for yourself?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:16):**  Well, we've been, we replanted the first block in 2007.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:21):**  So it's going to be 12 years this year.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:24):**  And then we replanted 2008, 2009, 2013, 14.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:32):**  We've been replanting kind of every year since in a smaller capacity.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:37):**  This year, we just put in a block totally departing from the whole idea of planting  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:42):**  an orchard where we seeded an orchard.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:45):**  So that's getting into experimenting and trying new things.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:50):**  But it, yeah, it took a few years.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:53):**  The orchards, most of the orchard blocks are in full production.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:57):**  So that's very nice that now it's really cranking.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:02):**  But it takes a few years.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:05):**  Orchards are not planting a radish crop.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:07):**  And I always remind people, you know, you're maybe used to planting vegetables and it's  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:11):**  30 days and 60 days.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:14):**  Well, this is more like three years to six years.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:17):**  So it's a very different timescale.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:21):**  It'll take a lot more patience.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:22):**  It'll take a lot more financial backing because you're going to have to, till you start having  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:30):**  money coming in, it will be money going out.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:34):**  Yeah, that's something that we've covered so many times in previous episodes on this  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:38):**  podcast is how to make that transition into a perennial system, especially one that matures  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:43):**  kind of late and how to manage the finances and the diversity and work in the efficiency  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:48):**  of the model to make sure that it pays back as an investment.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:52):**  Let's keep going with the beginning because you said that you were starting to teach permaculture  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:57):**  even before you started to transition the orchard yourself.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:00):**  Can you talk a little bit about how people can get started designing an orchard that  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:04):**  creates a resilient ecosystem with as little inputs as possible as you defined your goals  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:09):**  in the film?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:11):**  What are some of the most important things to consider?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:15):**  I like to say just start.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:17):**  That's really a mantra that I like to push because if you think, well, I don't have this  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:25):**  and I don't have that and I don't have the land and I don't have, and you put all kinds  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:31):**  of reasons why you can't while just focus on, I say, start with two trios.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:38):**  You say, well, I'm living in a suburb or I'm living in the city and I don't have much room.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:44):**  Do you have room for six trees and it may be just six shrubs.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:48):**  You can do trios with shrubs.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:51):**  And so just start, get some trees in, get two trios because two trios work really well.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:58):**  If you just put in three trees, then none of the trees may have the ability to get pollinated  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:04):**  and therefore you'll think, well, it doesn't produce.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:06):**  Well, it doesn't produce because you only have one of each of the trees.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:11):**  So two trios guarantees that you'll have, well, it doesn't guarantee, but it makes it  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:15):**  far more likely that you'll have good pollination and you'll have a good start.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:20):**  And you'll learn just as much with two trios as you would with 200 trees.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:26):**  So that's the key is if you can start, and those of you who are listening who are further  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:31):**  south, you still have a planting season.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:34):**  You may still be able to plant where the ground is totally frozen here and this planting season  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:40):**  is well over, but if you can start this fall, even this weekend, go out and just put in  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:47):**  six trees, start with that and then gradually you'll diversify, add a couple of shrubs for  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:53):**  each tree and fruiting shrubs.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:55):**  So you'll have your collection.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:57):**  And what I like to say is if you start that way, now that's not a huge investment, putting  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:03):**  in six trees and let's say 12 shrubs and company that by some perennials, you may put  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:10):**  in for $500.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:11):**  You say, well, you know, that's a lot of money.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:14):**  Well, $500 is really not a lot of money compared to putting in an orchard of a few hundred  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:20):**  trees.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:22):**  But when you have these six trees going and the shrubs underneath and some perennials  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:29):**  in two years, the plants that really are happy, and I like to say happy because a plant that's  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:34):**  happy will double every year.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:37):**  So in two years, you will probably get to a point where you can multiply your existing  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:44):**  plants by 10.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:47):**  That's where it gets interesting.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:48):**  You say, well, I don't know how to do that.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:49):**  Well, in two years you will have plenty of time to learn how.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:54):**  And so you'll be able to do some propagation.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:57):**  You'll be able to learn about taking cuttings.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:00):**  If you check out my YouTube channel, I got some nice little videos on propagating shrubs  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:05):**  and a couple of easy techniques.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:07):**  And so those are ways that you can get started very relatively inexpensive.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:15):**  And then if you say, well, it'll give you the opportunity to grow.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:20):**  So if you say, well, I only put in two trios.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:23):**  Well, what's 10 times that?  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:25):**  That's 12 trios.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:28):**  And then from there, so 12 trios times six, you're up to 72 trees.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:33):**  And then you can grow by another 10 times in another two years.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:38):**  So it's that kind of multiplication.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:40):**  You say, well, all I have room for is six trees and that's where I want to stay.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:44):**  Well, great.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:45):**  Then you can get started and have your yard producing in just a few years with two trios.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:54):**  So it's really that whole issue of starting.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:57):**  And I know, I mean, I'm talking to you about it, but I know because I had  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:03):**  the dream and the idea of doing it, but I had this monoculture orchard and it really  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:09):**  kept me for quite a few years from starting to replant the orchard the way I wanted.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:15):**  So just start, I should have started years ago with a lot less rather than trying to  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:21):**  put in right away.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:23):**  We put in one acre and then we put in two and three and a half acres.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:30):**  So it's a lot more to think in that scale while you could start much smaller.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:37):**  And then you'll, at least if you start, you'll have the fruit that much earlier.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:43):**  And it's the time element that's really critical because the longer you delay, the longer you  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:49):**  won't get to taste the fruit of your work.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:52):**  And that's where the change really happens.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:54):**  When you start to harvest, then you start to go, oh my gosh, the first year we harvested  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:01):**  a few sweet cherries.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:02):**  I thought, why didn't I put in 50?  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:07):**  Because it takes a few years for them to produce.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:10):**  And then when they did, I thought, wow, one tree, the birds come in, I eat everything.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:15):**  So that's another issue.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:18):**  But yeah, I thought I should have put in more.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:20):**  And so, okay.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:22):**  But at least I learned with that one and now I'm planning to put in more.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:27):**  But that's the progression.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:29):**  Just start is so important to it.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:32):**  But I really love that advice and that methodology.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:35):**  I really have echoed that in some of the things that I've taught through my own courses.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:39):**  And it applies to many other things than just ecosystems as well.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:43):**  Like I talk about starting with very small projects in natural building.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:47):**  And it's a great way of working out some of the difficulties, the learning curve, and  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:51):**  the mistakes that you're going to do on smaller projects with less risk and a lot less to  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:56):**  lose if you get it wrong or if you make some larger mistakes.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:00):**  And like you said, especially with these projects taking longer with the successional models  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:04):**  of perennial plants, not only will it make it much cheaper to propagate and grow your  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:10):**  orchard down the line, but it'll give you the time to learn those skills and make some  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:14):**  of those adjustments as you learn them rather than making a big initial investment and running  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:21):**  the risk of it failing because you're new to the whole system.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:26):**  And if it fails, it's not as big of a financial hit.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:30):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:31):**  I guess for you, you're talking something like use the opportunity to build a little  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:36):**  shed, which you don't need the different permitting.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:40):**  Most places they'll allow you to put in a shed.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:42):**  So if you build a little 8 by 10 shed, well, you don't need permits for that.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:48):**  And you can practice building with whatever, clay, mud, the mud brick or a straw bale or  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:55):**  whatever technique, but you've practiced it and you're, you're getting going.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:59):**  And it's the same thing, just a different scale.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:02):**  When you go to say, well, now I want to build a house that's a 30 by 30.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:07):**  Well, it's not the corners.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:09):**  It's the same detail.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:10):**  The wall, it's the same detail.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:13):**  The work around the door, it's the same detail.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:17):**  And a lot of people find out in the first project that they either do or do not even  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:22):**  really like what they set out to do.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:24):**  You know, it's, it's just something you've got to figure out, like you said, by, by jumping  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:28):**  into it and just getting started.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:30):**  Now, I would even back up one more and say, if you see somebody asking for help and they  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:36):**  want to do a building, jump in on their project.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:41):**  Because as you say, rather than getting through all of that and getting set up to start building  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:46):**  a shed in the back, in your backyard, maybe if you're helping somebody on theirs and you  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:50):**  go, Oh, this isn't exactly what I want to do.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:53):**  Well, that's great.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:55):**  You've learned that you don't even want to embark on maybe that technique.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:59):**  So then jump on another project and, and people can learn.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:03):**  You don't have to do it all in your place.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:07):**  You can help other people and you'll learn, you'll do the process.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:11):**  Especially because you're likely to be working with people with more experience that can  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:14):**  help give you advice that you might not even have come to on your own just for not having  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:19):**  thought through that process for as long as they have.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:21):**  I mean, I've been very fortunate that that's mostly how I learned this stuff.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:24):**  I went to school for totally different things, but I traveled around all over the world,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:28):**  just helping people on their projects and, you know, slowly but surely building a skill  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:32):**  set into these that, that kind of helped me advance without having to take on all of the  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:38):**  risk and the upfront cost.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:41):**  Where are you based, Oliver?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:42):**  So let's get back to the topic.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:43):**  Hold on.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:44):**  I'm from Minnesota right now.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:46):**  Right now I'm in Kuwait.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:47):**  But I'm just visiting family.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:49):**  I am based in Spain, though I'm from Minnesota and I did most of this work and, and really  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:55):**  worked on my first farm in Guatemala.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:57):**  So it's, it's been a huge mess of locations.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:01):**  So just in Spain, are you working or do you have a project planned in the next six months?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:06):**  You have a build there?  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:07):**  So now that I have transitioned away from the farm that I had in Guatemala, I am in  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:12):**  the stage of looking for land.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:14):**  And there's actually a couple of places that my partner and I are looking into more closely.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:19):**  And it's one of the reasons why I'm talking to you now.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:21):**  And I've looked into so many of the resources that you've put out is because starting up  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:25):**  an orchard is one of the things that I think might be most viable for us on a small acreage  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:31):**  and having it integrate with a couple of other enterprises on a small farm.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:35):**  Right.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:36):**  And so here, let's, let's jump back a little bit now to some of your methodology and how  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:42):**  you develop your companion plant polycultures.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:45):**  I really love your NAP system.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:48):**  And could you, first of all, explain a little bit of the NAP methodology and do you have  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:55):**  to wait years to see what grows well together or can you make some educated guesses that  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:00):**  speed up that process?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:02):**  Yeah, first of all, I don't use the NAP anymore.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:07):**  Really, you've transitioned away from that one.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:10):**  Well, I use what I call trios simply because the NAP kind of locked people in the NAP was  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:16):**  NAP and N was the symbol for a nitrogen fixer.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:20):**  So that's fine.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:22):**  And then I would say, AP was apple pear or apple plum.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:26):**  Well, that's fine if you're in my type of climate, but if you're in Kuwait, NAP doesn't  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:32):**  work at all.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:33):**  And that you say, well, apples don't grow here.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:36):**  So now I just keep it as trios and people can understand.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:40):**  Trio, okay, what's a trio?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:41):**  Well, one is a nitrogen fixer and then use two fruit trees or a fruit tree and a nut  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:47):**  or two nuts.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:49):**  So that's the definition really of my trios now.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:53):**  But it's important that those two that aren't the nitrogen fixers not be the same species.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:58):**  Right, right.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:00):**  So that's the basis of trios and yeah, I would say your second part is my understanding and  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:11):**  observation of it is that most plants really want to cooperate.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:16):**  There are very few examples where the plants really don't work well together and it took  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:21):**  10 years to see that.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:23):**  And the example was in Mollison's book.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:26):**  And I saw that and I thought, yeah, but you know, I thought, well, you know, if a tree  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:33):**  is stressed and this is what I did learn is that when a tree is not stressed, it doesn't  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:40):**  need its defense system.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:42):**  Now what's a defense?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:44):**  An example used with walnuts.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:45):**  Right.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:46):**  So Mollison talked about walnuts doesn't go well with apples.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:50):**  And I thought, well, you know, I've had my trees for nine years and they're doing fine  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:55):**  and they're next to each other and there's no problem.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:57):**  Well, when the walnut tree really started to produce, now it's a totally different tree.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:04):**  It's no longer the juvenile that all it's looking to do is grow wood.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:07):**  Now it has to put out nuts.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:10):**  So when the walnut really began and it had begun a few years earlier with a few nuts,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:15):**  but when it really started to produce nuts en masse, then it no longer wanted the apple  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:22):**  next to it and every walnut that was next to an apple tree killed the apple tree that  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:28):**  was right next to it.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:30):**  And that, that extended up to about 50 feet away.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:34):**  So the roots are quite far out and they will affect.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:39):**  So if I had, for example, a walnut as the nut tree and then apple and then a nitrogen  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:45):**  fixer, and then I would have two fruit trees and a nitrogen fixer.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:50):**  If in the second trio, if you can imagine there's a first trio and a second trio, the  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:55):**  apple in the first trio would be killed, but the apple in the second trio so far hasn't  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:00):**  been affected.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:01):**  So there is a distance element that is important because basically the walnut won't go through,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:09):**  let's say five other trees to get to the roots of the second apple.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:13):**  That's too far.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:14):**  And so it did, it did kill all the apple trees and it happened really quite quickly.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:19):**  I was surprised within two years, first you'd see, well, this tree is starting to look a  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:24):**  little affected, like the leaf color would change.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:28):**  And well, by the end of the second year, every one of them were completely dead dry, you  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:34):**  know, firewood.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:36):**  So that is the only example that I have observed of them not getting along.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:41):**  Now I don't know for all climates and all the different species, cause I know that,  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:47):**  you know, I just came back from a tour of Europe and in France, especially the South  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:52):**  of France, the range of fruit trees that you can grow.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:56):**  Wow.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:57):**  It's like, man, or the Southern US, you can grow so many different fruit.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:01):**  I mean, we've got apple, pear, plum, and limited cherries.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:06):**  That's our fruit range.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:07):**  You say, well, no, apricots don't grow well here in the flatlands anyway, in the mountains  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:15):**  they may.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:16):**  And so you're really limited in the range while they're talking much more diversity.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:21):**  So I don't know with all the different combinations, but overall I have seen that plants do well  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:29):**  together.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:32):**  I mean, those are just variables that you have to start to discover when you get to  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:36):**  know your place and your context much better.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:39):**  It's impossible for someone to learn that for the whole world.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:45):**  Let's talk about some of the other methods that you use to reduce the maintenance and  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:50):**  the extra work that you would have to do to take care of these trees.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:54):**  I know you have sort of a controversial method of managing weeds, though I've heard your  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:59):**  defense of plastic mulch and I understand it.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:02):**  Could you explain it a little to our listeners?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:05):**  So I mean, I never set out to put out plastic mulch in the orchard.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:09):**  That wasn't the original intent.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:11):**  We did start with wood chips, the rameo branch fragments, which is chipped small branches.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:20):**  The idea was that you put in a layer of mulch and I had worked on many projects before the  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:26):**  orchard where if we put six inches or about 15 centimeters of these wood chips, they would  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:33):**  last for about three years or they decompose at the rate of about an inch a year.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:39):**  So you would have a good mulch for three years.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:42):**  And I thought, huh, great.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:43):**  You know, so we scrounged around, managed to get about a hundred cubic yards of wood  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:52):**  chips.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:53):**  And that's a tractor trailer load equivalent.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:56):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:58):**  We spread that by hand.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:00):**  I don't know if anybody's ever emptied a tractor trailer load.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:04):**  It's not a small amount.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:05):**  So it's a lot of work.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:07):**  So we put it out, but it was done and it was like, that's great.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:12):**  That was November.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:13):**  And by when the snow melted in late March, early April, and the grass started to green,  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:20):**  it would be green right across the whole field.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:23):**  There was no visible lines of wood chips left.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:29):**  And I thought, well, that's impossible.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:31):**  You know, we put in, I know we have photos.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:35):**  And so I thought, what's going on here?  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:37):**  Well, by June, we were looking for our orchard in the grass, and that's not a good way to  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:43):**  start an orchard.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:44):**  If you can't even see the trees because of the grass, you can't expect the trees to grow.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:51):**  So we were at risk of losing the orchard.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:54):**  And that's a lot of work.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:56):**  I mean, planting is actually the least work.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:59):**  It's getting, we grew all our own trees.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:01):**  So it's growing your trees for basically three years before and starting rootstock and then  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:07):**  grafting and so on.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:09):**  So that was like, we got to do something or we're going to lose the orchard because the  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:13):**  trees are overwhelmed by grass.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:15):**  We could mow.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:18):**  But the thing is, you got to know where your trees are exactly.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:20):**  Because if you don't see them, anyway, it was a lot of work.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:24):**  And we decided we got to do something.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:26):**  Let's try some plastic because we had used plastic in the nursery and it was so, so much  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:31):**  easier that we said, maybe if we could put some of this big thick silage plastic, we  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:37):**  could work underneath the trees.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:40):**  So we did, which is something I would never do again.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:43):**  Not that I don't want to use plastic, but I would never do it the way I show you to  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:47):**  use in the film.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:49):**  So you could see there's some, there's been improvements over the years of how we do things  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:54):**  simply because it would take us four people one week to do one acre of laying plastic  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:00):**  mulch the way we did after we had put the trees in.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:04):**  So the big difference now is I would have somebody come in and they could do 12 acres  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:11):**  in a day with a mulch layer and they could lay down the plastic mulch with drip irrigation  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:17):**  under the plastic.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:19):**  And then you come in and you plant your small, small fruit trees and you're good to go.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:24):**  You got an orchard that is super low maintenance because you don't have to be putting  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:30):**  anything to control grass, which even in organic, because you don't have herbicides, what you  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:36):**  would do is you'd use a, like a cultivator and you would basically weed under the trees  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:42):**  when they're young with that.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:45):**  And I've seen other people use acids to put, like you could use even cider vinegar to put  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:52):**  underneath the trees that will kill the grass and so on.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:55):**  So there's organic techniques that are approved.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:00):**  But we went with plastic.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:01):**  And so I say, you know, don't think of plastic until you've got over 200 trees because you  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:08):**  really could mulch for 200 trees.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:11):**  You really could mulch that.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:13):**  It's it's a big job, but it's doable.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:16):**  Well, when we're talking five acres and we needed to put at least three times more mulch  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:21):**  than we did, which means three tractor loads times five acres.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:25):**  Now you're talking 15 tractor loads.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:28):**  Maybe you can't handle that amount of material by hand.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:31):**  You think, oh, I'm young, I'm strong.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:33):**  Listen, start with one tractor trailer load, unload that.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:37):**  And you tell me if you're good for 15 and you have to do that every year pretty well.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:44):**  Well, not realistic at all.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:46):**  It's a different thing.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:47):**  So one of the things I learned early was my experience was all in garden projects and  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:55):**  yard projects.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:57):**  And I quickly learned the orchard is no longer a garden or yard scale.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:03):**  It is a much bigger scale.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:05):**  And so you have to think in terms of scale, as long as you're leaving it, your orchard  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:10):**  to a yard, then you can do a lot of things very differently from what you would do when  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:16):**  you're talking acres of area.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:22):**  At that scale, the economics of it just changes.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:26):**  And so you've done a really good job about harvesting nature's resources to help you  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:30):**  with a lot of the maintenance and the balance of the ecosystem that you're cultivating.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:35):**  Can you talk a little bit about how you work to attract beneficial predators and insects  
**[0:31:40-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:40):**  and help to keep away some of the hazards and the pests through just smart design?  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:48):**  Well, the biggest is the biodiversity right from the start.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:51):**  So that's an essential.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:54):**  As soon as we did that with not really any other major change from the way the orchard  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:59):**  was before, we got rid of our worst pest, which was a caterpillar.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:05):**  And that was so convincing.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:07):**  When I planted the orchard, I actually didn't say a word about it.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:11):**  I kept my gate closed.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:14):**  I didn't want anybody to come by and visit because the few people who did look and say,  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:20):**  they basically were telling me how crazy it was and how it'll never work.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:24):**  Well, listen, when I planted, I wasn't convinced.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:27):**  I mean, it's one thing to read.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:29):**  And let me let me stop on this.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:32):**  You can read all kinds of stuff and you can watch the film about the permaculture orchard  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:37):**  and say, oh, look at what he did.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:39):**  And all you know is what you see.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:42):**  So there's levels of knowing.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:44):**  You can know because you read about it or you saw it in a video.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:48):**  That's all you do is you know that.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:52):**  But then there is knowing with conviction, which happens only when you've actually tried  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:57):**  it and done it and done it.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:00):**  Even I would say done it at a scale that you want to do it.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:04):**  Then you get a level of conviction that is basically unshakable.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:08):**  Like I can people can say all kinds of things, but I kind of just smile and say, well, thank  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:15):**  you for your your point of view.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:17):**  And right.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:18):**  And it I like to say to people who and there are people who criticize because there will  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:24):**  always be people who criticize and that's just normal.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:27):**  And I'll just say that's that's a good point.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:30):**  I said, how many trees do you have?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:32):**  Right.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:33):**  And that usually stops them dead because some of the people who are most vocal are also  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:38):**  the ones who are armchair gardeners or farmers.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:42):**  And they've read and they've heard and they've listened to Mark Sheppard and they've listened  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:46):**  to what I said and they've listened to other people and they'll have comments.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:50):**  But hey, get off your couch, get out of your chair and get planting, get doing, because  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:56):**  all you know is your telephone effect.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:59):**  And until you actually start doing it and trying it and practicing it, you really don't  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:07):**  know.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:08):**  You just you know, you'll propagate ideas.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:11):**  And that's one of the dangers of seeing books written by people who basically glean information  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:17):**  from others.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:18):**  They're just repeating what others say, but they've never tried it out for themselves.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:23):**  Of course.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:24):**  So in balancing this ecosystem, what are some of the methods that you recommend people do  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:30):**  to really invite a cooperation with nature?  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:34):**  And you know, you started with the diversity of your plantings.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:37):**  Can you create habitat in other ways or incentives for the wildlife that you want to come maybe  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:44):**  even before these plantings are established?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:46):**  Sure.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:47):**  I mean, some of the quick ones, the easiest and we're talking, let's say wildlife.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:52):**  Wildlife have three basic needs, food, cover and water.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:57):**  So food, you could think, well, you know, what can I do?  
**[0:35:01-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:01):**  Well, you could probably add a feeder.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:03):**  So if you're going to put trees, put in a feeder.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:06):**  It's not the same birds exactly that are going to eat your, let's say seed as will eat your  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:12):**  fruit.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:13):**  Or if you're in a more Southern area, you could actually give them fruit and then you'll  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:18):**  get birds who like to eat fruit and they, you could put a fruit feeder and that works  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:22):**  well in the tropics and subtropics.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:26):**  So that's one.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:27):**  So food is a simple, quick, I like to say, you know, do the quick stuff first because  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:31):**  you could do that this weekend.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:33):**  So get out a feeder.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:36):**  The next thing is, is cover.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:38):**  That takes a little longer.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:39):**  You want to give them a place that they feel safe to hide in.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:43):**  If you look at, let's say our orchard, we actually planted this year plantings just  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:49):**  for habitat for cover for the future.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:52):**  And because in the orchard, in the winter time, it's completely stark.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:57):**  Like it's just branches.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:59):**  There's no leaves.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:00):**  All the leaves have fallen.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:01):**  We're in a deciduous climate.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:02):**  There's no evergreen leaves or persistent leaves on the trees.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:07):**  So we started to plant a Cedar tree, which is a evergreen in our climate.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:13):**  And we put in a whole row down the middle, basically where birds will be able to come  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:19):**  into the orchard and in the future, as these trees grow and feel safe there.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:24):**  So that's the importance of cover.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:25):**  And you say, well, that's planting.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:27):**  And that takes a while.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:28):**  So if you're pruning branches, you can make brush piles.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:33):**  And we got hundreds of yards of brush pile all around the orchard.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:38):**  So that's an important one.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:41):**  You can even start with just one pile.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:43):**  And there are some species that will use that.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:46):**  So cover is really, it's often the critical factor.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:50):**  It's what's usually most lacking.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:52):**  And another simple one is water.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:55):**  So a good example, if you've ever had tomatoes and you've had, especially in our climate,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:02):**  we get squirrels eating tomatoes.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:05):**  Well if you have that, that's a sure sign that you just don't have any water around  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:10):**  because a squirrel doesn't prefer tomatoes, but it will drink the liquid or the juice  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:15):**  out of the tomato when it needs water.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:18):**  And it's only doing it to get some water.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:20):**  So you can get cues that way that, oh, you know what?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:24):**  I don't have enough water.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:25):**  We'll put in a bird bath, then maybe put in a pond, a little pond, and then put in a bigger  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:31):**  pond.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:32):**  So these are the kinds of things you can do and it adds to the diversity.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:37):**  And once you've got these key elements, for example, in one of, we have little ponds,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:42):**  we're in totally sandy soil and we have to add water every few days to a little pond  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:48):**  just for it to hold water.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:51):**  But we have one area that's a little more clay because we had a load of rock dust dumped  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:58):**  there and where the rock dust is, it makes like a clay.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:01):**  And because that's a pond and it stays wet and it's basically a clay surface, that's  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:08):**  where all the wasps come that are, that need balls of, it's the mud wasp that need balls  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:14):**  of mud.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:16):**  And we wouldn't have mud wasps if we didn't have that pond.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:19):**  So that's the limiting factor to getting that kind of wasp.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:23):**  And then we can add structures for some of the insects.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:27):**  So we do add logs for bees and pieces of wood, wood holes drill them for bees.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:35):**  And that's a whole range of different species of bees.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:39):**  We have put up biotopes, which are basically little shelters.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:44):**  It's more than an insect hotel because it's for insects, it's for birds, it's for bats,  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:48):**  it's for snakes and frogs and so on.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:53):**  So yeah, that's pushing it because, well, that's my background and I want to see what  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:59):**  we can do.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:00):**  The simplest things that we could do, but that were the most effective.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:03):**  But your two keys, at least in our climate, temperate climate for reducing insects that  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:10):**  will help you a lot is birds and wasps.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:14):**  And if people don't like wasps, well, get over it and get used to it because they are  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:19):**  the single most important insect in the orchard.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:23):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:25):**  And it's one of the things that I love that when you kind of get into this attitude of  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:28):**  working with nature, you don't have to do a lot of the detailed work.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:33):**  Sometimes it's just a matter of getting out of the way or providing the really base tools  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:37):**  or resources.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:39):**  And that's where life takes over.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:40):**  And if they have what they need to survive and thrive, it just starts to compound on  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:44):**  itself as those resources become available.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:48):**  That's a great summary.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:51):**  Let's talk a little bit, another thing that you're very good at is diversifying not only  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:55):**  the ecology that you're working with.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:57):**  So you've moved away from monocultures, you've provided the resources for wildlife and beneficial  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:02):**  insects to come in and start to balance itself out.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:05):**  But you also work with chickens.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:07):**  And I know you have other kind of complementary enterprises on the farm that help with the  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:11):**  fertility, the soil building and all of these.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:14):**  Can you talk about how this fits into the larger plan of the health of the orchard and  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:19):**  even helps with the economics and the resiliency of the farm enterprise?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:24):**  Yeah, I kind of look at agriculture really needs in our, again, I'll say in our climate,  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:33):**  but in a lot of climates, trees are essential.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:37):**  So where trees can grow, trees are really important for the ecosystem, but also for  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:45):**  the system to function well, because it's the habitat and so on.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:49):**  So trees are one and then animals are one.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:52):**  So if you think, well, you know, and I've heard a lot of people who would be a vegan  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:57):**  would say, well, yeah, but I don't want animals because I just want to grow the plants and  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:03):**  that's fine.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:04):**  But it's so much harder because the plants really rely on the animals and the animals  
**[0:41:10-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:10):**  rely on the plants.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:11):**  It is part of the ecosystem.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:13):**  So it's, you can't really get enough wildlife often to do the impact.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:20):**  And so raising animals is a good way to add to the impact and say, well, I don't want  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:28):**  to raise animals.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:29):**  Okay, then keep them as a, you know, have a shelter for animals and keep animals.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:33):**  But the animal impact is really, really important.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:39):**  You can't build soil as quickly as you can with a pulsed system of, especially a mob  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:48):**  grazing.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:49):**  And mob grazing, if you're not familiar with it, look in the words mob grazing.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:54):**  It's far more than for years, the system was encouraged to do rotational grazing or intensive  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:01):**  rotational grazing, or another word is called management intensive grazing.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:06):**  Those are great.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:07):**  And that's, you know, start with that.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:10):**  And then as you progress, you'll learn, wow, we could even take this a big step further  
**[0:42:15-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:15):**  where we're talking mob grazing, which is a very limited time on a small area with a  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:25):**  given amount of animal impact.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:28):**  And that changes it even more.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:30):**  Like some of the practitioners in our area, there's one guy who I think he has the highest  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:35):**  organic matter soils in our part of the country.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:41):**  His soils go from 14% to 24% organic matter.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:45):**  Well, 24% organic matter is like your best vegetable soils kind of thing.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:52):**  And he's got that.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:53):**  Nearly compost at that point.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:55):**  It's incredible.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:56):**  He never has puddles happening because you've got such a huge sponge.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:02):**  So now he's actually looking at, well, maybe we should start doing something to use some  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:07):**  of this.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:08):**  Cause like how far do you want to, you know, compound this amount of organic matter, but  
**[0:43:13-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:13):**  that's what happens when he moves his animals four times a day and he's talking sheep, mostly  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:19):**  cows and sheep.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:22):**  But if you move animals four times a day and they only come back at sometimes of the year  
**[0:43:27-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:27):**  in 60 or 70 days, wow, that, that gives the grass lots of time to recover.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:36):**  And it, it, it really works with the grass.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:39):**  Like this is not something new.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:41):**  The Buffalo did this and the, you know, the wildebeest do this and we really need to,  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:46):**  if we're looking to nature as a, an inspiration, we need to learn what exactly is nature doing  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:53):**  and how exactly, what's the pattern, what animals interact in this system?  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:58):**  Cause it's not just plants, it's a plant animal interaction.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:02):**  And there is a reason why there's a whole group of animals called herbivores and they  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:07):**  eat grass or they eat vegetation.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:10):**  And then it could be browsers as well.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:13):**  But these are really a critical part of this system and we need to try to bring them in  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:21):**  and use them.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:23):**  And that's how, that is a great way to increase the soil, increase the soil carbon, increase  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:29):**  the organic matter, increase the fertility, increase the fungal biomass in the soil.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:35):**  I mean, there's the benefits just keep, it's like a virtuous cycle.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:39):**  Everything just keeps getting better and better and better.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:43):**  And the fact for us, for the orchard of having a diversity of tree species, wow, it, it,  
**[0:44:49-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:49):**  it really is getting to be easier and easier.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:52):**  And the amount of work really goes down.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:55):**  We had our absolute best year ever this year.  
**[0:44:58-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:58):**  We've never had such a crop.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:59):**  Like we, we left, I think 40 or 50 trees loaded with fruit because we didn't even know what  
**[0:45:05-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:05):**  to do with.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:06):**  We'd given away free fruit for two weekends.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:11):**  And it's like, well, everybody who, you know, we've contacted has come and everybody's got  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:18):**  everything they need.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:21):**  So it's a, it's a nice situation when the system starts to respond and really, really  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:27):**  kick in and produce.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:28):**  So it is a virtuous cycle.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:31):**  And if you work with nature rather than working against nature, and I mean anything that,  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:36):**  that responds or relies on killing them, you kind of going a little bit in the wrong direction  
**[0:45:42-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:42):**  there.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:43):**  I don't say we don't kill some things cause we do trap a couple of insects that we aim  
**[0:45:48-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:48):**  to reduce their population.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:50):**  But for the majority of things that were a problem, they're no longer a problem.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:56):**  There's some great points there about, you know, mostly working to balance the ecosystem,  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:00):**  but you mentioned that you do actually come in and interfere a little bit with those insect  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:05):**  populations.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:06):**  Could you talk a little bit about when you decide that it's necessary to take some matters  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:11):**  into your own hands and how you've chosen to do that in the case of insects and things  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:16):**  like blights that can affect your trees?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:18):**  Yeah, well first, certainly insects.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:22):**  Most places, I would say now, at least in the Western world, have some form of a scouting  
**[0:46:29-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:29):**  service.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:31):**  It could be governmental, it could be private.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:34):**  And so the scouting is very useful.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:37):**  They will usually tell you there is a certain insect that has started to be caught in traps  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:45):**  and so we're nearing a threshold.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:48):**  And so that, I use that service in our area in Quebec and I just really want to know when  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:55):**  is an insect starting to be seen?  
**[0:46:58-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:58):**  Cause it's just handy.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:59):**  You can do your own, but they're actually doing that every day.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:04):**  And so once they start trapping a certain insect in my area, then I go ahead and usually  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:12):**  we do trapping.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:13):**  So we trap for coddling moth and we trap for apple maggot fly.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:17):**  So that service gives me a date when I need to have, and I always know the approximate  
**[0:47:23-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:23):**  date, but that can change plus or minus 10 days in a year.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:27):**  And so then I go ahead and we set out traps for those insects.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:32):**  And what kind of traps do you use?  
**[0:47:35-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:35):**  What have you found to be effective?  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:36):**  Well we, we've actually made our own traps.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:39):**  So we have a very simple, it's a recycled oil container that we use to trap coddling  
**[0:47:45-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:45):**  moth and we just drill four holes at the top to allow the moths, adult moths to enter the  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:52):**  trap.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:53):**  And inside we just put a mix of molasses and water, 50-50.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:58):**  So we put about two inches or four or five centimeters inside and that's enough.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:05):**  So once the moth comes in, they'll drown in the trap.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:10):**  And so they've been really effective.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:11):**  We've had as little as 3% damage, which is the acceptable amount for conventional orchards.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:18):**  And so by trapping that that way, it's really nice.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:22):**  We set out one trap per trio or one trap per three trees, and that works really well.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:28):**  We do have to come back in the season and check them.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:32):**  And if there isn't enough liquid, then we'll usually just top it off with water because  
**[0:48:38-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:38):**  it's not the molasses that evaporates.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:40):**  It's just the water.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:42):**  Sure.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:44):**  And you also use a biological spray.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:48):**  I got from the film that you use whey concoction, the byproduct of cheese production to coat  
**[0:48:57-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:57):**  the leaves.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:58):**  Can you tell me how that works in balance with the ecosystem?  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:02):**  Yeah, whey is a great product actually.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:06):**  I love the idea that you can spray something on the trees that you can just stop and have  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:11):**  a drink from.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:13):**  So if you can eat it or you can drink it, then to spray it is pretty safe.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:20):**  The only caveat I'd say is if someone is really intolerant to lactose, there will be some  
**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:25):**  lactose in whey.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:28):**  But that's the only case of any kind of problem we've seen with using whey.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:34):**  It doesn't actually kill anything on the leaves.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:38):**  And the way it works is it just outcompetes the fungal spores for the food that the fungus  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:45):**  need to grow.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:47):**  And so if you spray whey, and usually you'll spray like you would spray for any fungicide,  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:53):**  you spray a couple of days, a day or two before a rain.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:57):**  And the spray in whey, what it does is the bacteria in the whey will go on the leaf as  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:05):**  you spray it, and they will eat up the exudates or the sugars that are naturally found on  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:11):**  the top and the bottom of the leaf.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:13):**  And they'll eat the sugars so that then when the rain falls, a day or two later, and the  
**[0:50:18-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:18):**  spores start to come out, basically think of it as hatching while they hatch and they  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:26):**  are free in the air.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:27):**  And when they land on the leaf, they immediately germinate.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:30):**  They send out a little equivalent of a little rootlet.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:34):**  But as soon as that rootlet goes out and seeks to grow, which is seeking to actually get  
**[0:50:40-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:40):**  established, they don't find any food.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:43):**  There's no sugar left because the bacteria from the whey have eaten all the sugars.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:48):**  And so the spores just die.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:51):**  And so it's nice to know that it actually doesn't kill them, but they do die, but not  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:56):**  from the direct application of the whey.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:00):**  They just die because they have no food left on the leaf surface.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:04):**  So it's nice because we could spray whey and we get a lot of mushroom growth now happening  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:08):**  in the orchard.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:09):**  So as opposed to putting anything that's a fungicide or something that kills fungus,  
**[0:51:15-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:15):**  this doesn't kill it.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:17):**  It actually feeds fungus that are in the soil because there's products in there that the  
**[0:51:24-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:24):**  fungus can feed on without actually feeding the fungus on the leaf.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:31):**  It's so simple.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:35):**  The guy I learned this from said we should actually throw out cheese and drink the whey  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:41):**  because it's where all the nutrition is in the milk after you make cheese.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:46):**  The cheese is just the agglutination or the gathering of all the fats and the whey is  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:51):**  all the protein and the nutrition and the vitamins and minerals.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:55):**  I agree with that.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:57):**  So we used to produce cheese on the farm in Guatemala and we would always save the whey.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:01):**  And what we didn't consume ourselves, we either used to inoculate fermentations for preserving  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:06):**  food or we would put it in our animal feed so that they got more protein and we didn't  
**[0:52:11-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:11):**  have to use nearly as much.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:13):**  There's a million and one uses for that stuff.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:15):**  It's excellent.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:16):**  And there's just one more to add to the tool belt.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:18):**  Yeah, and it's an approved organic product.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:22):**  So anybody who's looking to grow organically, it's not a problem.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:26):**  You can use whey.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:27):**  And there's so much of it.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:30):**  I mean, there is literally more than enough whey to replace all fungicide use in agriculture.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:37):**  Let me say that again.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:39):**  We could replace all the fungicides used in agriculture by using whey.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:44):**  And in fact, I was doing some studies last winter.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:48):**  What's, cause I, we did a study here in Quebec 20, almost 25 years ago on using whey and they  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:55):**  were, they found that it's as effective as using conventional sprays.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:59):**  Wow.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:00):**  That's a little disturbing to, let's say some industries.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:05):**  And so that report never, never was made public.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:09):**  But I did see some more recent research and in Australia in organic grape growing, they've  
**[0:53:16-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:16):**  been using it quite extensively and they were, the quantities they used, I was just, I was  
**[0:53:24-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:24):**  mind boggling.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:25):**  They're using 4% whey, which means the quantity of active, basically of whey and bacteria  
**[0:53:34-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:34):**  is only 4% of the volume of, of liquid sprayed on the orchard.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:41):**  So it's a tiny amount.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:44):**  We use a hundred percent just because, Hey, we can get it for free or just about, we just  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:49):**  pay for the transport.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:52):**  And it is a foliar feed, like you said, the protein and the vitamins, it is good for the  
**[0:53:57-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:57):**  trees.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:59):**  And so the idea of using 4%, so I thought, wow, I mean, even if we use that a hundred  
**[0:54:06-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:06):**  percent, there's enough to replace all fungicide use.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:09):**  And if you dilute it by 50% or 75% or even going to 90, you know, 96% diluted, I thought,  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:19):**  wow, we certainly have enough whey to replace all fungicides and it would be better for  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:24):**  the plants.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:25):**  It's kind of this thing that really needs to get this information out there.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:32):**  Exactly.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:33):**  I'm not holding my breath though, that it will happen because let's just say that it's  
**[0:54:38-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:38):**  a little disturbing for some very profitable, you know, enterprises.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:45):**  It's just so wonderful for the people in the know and the fact that it's cheap or free  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:49):**  like that is incredible.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:51):**  Now look, Stefan, there's one more thing that I really want to cover that I was blown away  
**[0:54:55-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:55):**  by as I've watched your YouTube videos and the other information you've put out.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:59):**  And that's the way that you market your products and make a better return on selling basically  
**[0:55:06-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:06):**  wholesale produce like this and the various other products that you go to.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:10):**  I realized that that's one of the big sticking points for a lot of people who get into farming  
**[0:55:13-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:13):**  is it can be pretty dismal, the returns that you get when you're selling through to middlemen  
**[0:55:20-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:20):**  who are just putting it out in the grocery stores.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:22):**  So could you talk a little bit about the marketing methods and the way that you get your hands  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:26):**  directly into the consumers who want this higher quality product?  
**[0:55:31-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:31):**  Yeah, actually I would recommend people, if you want the whole presentation, I gave a  
**[0:55:38-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:38):**  presentation in New Zealand.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:41):**  It's called membership marketing.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:43):**  If you just type in membership marketing on YouTube, James Samuel recorded the video when  
**[0:55:51-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:51):**  we did it.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:52):**  And it's a really good summary of how it works.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:54):**  So it's basically, it's not my idea.  
**[0:55:56-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:56):**  It's not my technique.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:57):**  It was put out by a gentleman called Booker T. Watley in the 70s or early 80s.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:04):**  He wrote a book, How to Make $120,000 on 25 Acres.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:10):**  And he basically outlined his formula, which is basically a membership marketing.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:16):**  So you're not selling to stores.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:20):**  You're not picking.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:22):**  Most importantly, you're not picking.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:24):**  You get people coming as a U-pick, but on top of being a U-pick, they actually join  
**[0:56:32-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:32):**  as members for the year.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:34):**  So pay you a fee early in the year, and then they come and pick and pay whatever the going  
**[0:56:39-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:39):**  price that you set for them to pick.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:43):**  So I aim to be priced at about a conventional grocery store price.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:49):**  And so people who are used to conventional stores, they think, well, you know, it's not  
**[0:56:53-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:53):**  really an advantage shopping here because I have to pick it on top of it.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:58):**  But anybody who's used to buying organic, they go, wow, like you could get easily half  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:03):**  price or less on some of the things.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:07):**  So there is a big difference.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:09):**  And the biggest difference is we don't have to do the majority of the harvest, which if  
**[0:57:15-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:15):**  you look at the economics of most crops, 40% of the cost of production is harvest and packaging.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:22):**  And people always underestimate packaging.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:26):**  So it's a great way, but there are caveats.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:28):**  Like you have to be within 30 minutes of 30,000 people.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:34):**  And we're really not, our farm is not ideally situated for the model.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:39):**  We're pretty well known.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:40):**  So we do get people, but we're still not, we're not overloaded with people joining as  
**[0:57:47-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:47):**  members most years.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:49):**  Some years we refuse people because if we don't have enough crop, we use the ability  
**[0:57:54-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:54):**  to balance our supply demand with the number of members we accept.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:00):**  So it's ranged from 25 families to a hundred families.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:05):**  And that's how we use to kind of balance out how much, how many people we allow to come  
**[0:58:12-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:12):**  pick is just using that.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:14):**  So that's, it's worked pretty well.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:17):**  It's a nice, it's a really nice model if you're in that range.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:23):**  And when I, yeah.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:26):**  Well and it seems like it solves one of the major problems that a lot of farms have, especially  
**[0:58:30-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:30):**  in their beginning, which is cash flowing early on.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:32):**  A lot of times you have to wait until a harvest comes in and then slowly try and reinvest  
**[0:58:37-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:37):**  that while kind of budgeting out until you get that another cash injection from the next  
**[0:58:42-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:42):**  harvest.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:43):**  And especially with longer, which are in perennial systems like this, that can be difficult,  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:47):**  but this way at least you get some cash upfront in the membership configuration that you can  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:52):**  use to kind of improve the system as you go, no?  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:57):**  Yes.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:58):**  And I do recommend that people who are looking to put in an orchard or any agroforestry,  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:03):**  anytime you're talking trees, you're talking a longer timeframe before harvesting.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:08):**  So I recommend that you start at the same time or in the same year, or even in the first  
**[0:59:14-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:14):**  year, you start with annual productions of either vegetables and or animals.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:21):**  And so if you buy, for example, chicks in the spring and sell them later in the summer  
**[0:59:25-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:25):**  or the fall as raised birds, that's a great way to get a nice cash flow.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:32):**  And I recommend people look up Joel Salton's system for growing, for example, broilers  
**[0:59:37-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:37):**  or turkeys or ducks and so on.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:40):**  So yes, combining the annual with the perennial because the perennial will take time and basically  
**[0:59:48-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:48):**  you will be creating your market for your perennial production by your annual crops.  
**[0:59:54-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:54):**  So I say, if you're good at selling and ideally if you're, let's say a couple of people and  
**[1:00:00-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:00):**  one person is great on production and one great on selling, I'd say you have a great  
**[1:00:05-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:05):**  combination, especially if you're in that, I like to say, just look around.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:10):**  Does your nearby town have a McDonald's?  
**[1:00:13-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:13):**  And if it does, then you know you're within the, you're in the range because McDonald's  
**[1:00:19-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:19):**  will not put a restaurant if they don't have a big enough population close by.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:26):**  So if there is a McDonald's, then you're good to go.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:29):**  You say, yeah, there's a McDonald's in town.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:31):**  Well, great.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:32):**  Your farm will have enough people to really go well, to work well in that model.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:38):**  But the big thing is you're no longer selling a commodity.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:42):**  You're actually selling, you know, it's, it's, it's not, you're not competing with whatever's  
**[1:00:48-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:48):**  in the store.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:49):**  People are going to be buying you, your brand and your farm.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:54):**  And that's a huge difference going from to retail compared to, you know, basically trying  
**[1:01:00-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:00):**  to sell on price, which is terrible.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:02):**  It's a terrible model to sell on price.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:05):**  You become a price maker rather than a price taker.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:08):**  And for agriculture, that's all the difference.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:11):**  Yeah, man, there's so many good things here to unpack.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:14):**  And I know we've only been able to go through kind of a brief overview of it.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:18):**  And so do you have resources and links and ways for people to get in contact who want  
**[1:01:24-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:24):**  to know more and dig in deeper to all of the great educational resources that you've been  
**[1:01:29-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:29):**  putting out?  
**[1:01:30-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:30):**  Yeah, I would say depending on what stage you're at.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:35):**  Certainly one of the easiest, if you're just interested and you want to find out more,  
**[1:01:40-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:40):**  get the film, the Permaculture Orchard Beyond Organic.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:43):**  So you can download a version depending which version you get, it's around 10 bucks.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:51):**  Start with that in two hours or a little more than two hours, you'll really, you won't be  
**[1:01:57-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:57):**  able to digest it all one go.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:00):**  I guarantee you there's so much in there, but you will have an idea of where you're  
**[1:02:05-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:05):**  going if you wanted to do that.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:08):**  If you're, that's if you're really looking to start out or if you've already started  
**[1:02:14-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:14):**  and you want some details.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:16):**  Otherwise, if you've already got trees put in, or you want to see how you can have it  
**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:22):**  diversified, we've actually kind of gone film plus and updated all the newest information  
**[1:02:29-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:29):**  we know in our virtual tour.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:33):**  And if you want to do, get specific on pruning, so we got a course put out called the Pruning  
**[1:02:39-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:39):**  Course.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:40):**  You can find that at pruningcourse.com and you can take the virtual tour of Miracle Farms  
**[1:02:46-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:46):**  and the Permaculture Orchard at miracle.farm.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:52):**  So fantastic.  
**[1:02:54-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:54):**  I would just say the last one would be some of the most recent, as it happens kind of  
**[1:02:59-1:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:59):**  information, is just on check out the YouTube channel under my name, Stefan Sapkowiak, or  
**[1:03:07-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:07):**  Instagram and Facebook.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:09):**  So those are kind of the places where I park whatever I'm learning or seeing or learning  
**[1:03:14-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:14):**  about and a good place to start.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:17):**  Nice.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:18):**  Yeah, I highly recommend those resources for anyone listening.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:21):**  And I'll be sure to put the links to all of those things that you've mentioned in the  
**[1:03:24-1:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:24):**  show notes for this podcast.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:26):**  So Stefan, it's been such a pleasure finally getting to talk to you.  
**[1:03:30-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:30):**  I'm a big fan of your work.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:31):**  I really look forward to seeing what else you put out here in the future.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:35):**  And thank you so much for making the time.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:36):**  I hope we can catch up again in the future.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:39):**  I hope so too.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:40):**  It would be great.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:41):**  Thanks for the opportunity, Oliver, and all the best on your project.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:44):**  Thanks so much.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:45):**  All right, you take care.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:46):**  Bye bye.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:47):**  Bye.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:48):**  All right, that wraps things up for this week's episode.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:52):**  If you enjoyed this interview and want to find more like it, as well as articles and

**[1:04:01-1:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:01):**  The best part is that you can search by topic rather than wading through more than 100 interviews  
**[1:04:06-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:06):**  by typing in any keyword or topic that you're looking for in the search function on the  
**[1:04:10-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:10):**  podcast page.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:12):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from  
**[1:04:15-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:15):**  natural materials, to beekeeping, vermicompost, permaculture design, philosophy, and so much  
**[1:04:21-1:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:21):**  more.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:23):**  Thank you so much to those of you who've taken the time to reach out via comments and emails.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:27):**  Your contributions helped me to make this the conversation that it's intended to be  
**[1:04:31-1:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:31):**  and helps me create more of the content around the topics that you're interested in.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:35):**  If you have any insights, advice, questions, or suggestions, be sure to send them to me  
**[1:04:39-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:39):**  at info at abundantedge.com, and I'll look forward to being in touch.  
**[1:04:44-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:04:44):**  New episodes come out every Friday like clockwork, so I'll catch you on next week's show.

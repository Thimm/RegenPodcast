### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:00):**  Alright hello everybody and welcome to the first of the monthly panel discussions!  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:15):**  Moving forward, each month I'll work with the Regenerative Skills community to explore  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:19):**  an aspect of Earth and life regeneration by speaking to the most influential voices on  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:24):**  a given subject.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:26):**  Like everything else on this show, this will be a collaborative effort.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:29):**  Now if you're among the members who participate in the discussions on our Discord chatroom,  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:34):**  you can help me decide not only the topics to explore, but help me to nominate the panelists  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:39):**  and questions during the discussion.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:42):**  Now if you're a subscribing Patreon member, you'll also be invited to the live events  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:46):**  and the open Q&A after the panel.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:49):**  Now in this first panel, I was invited to host a discussion on regenerative agriculture  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:54):**  with my friends and colleagues at Climate Farmers, which is a non-profit organization  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:00:58):**  working to advance regenerative ag in Europe.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:01):**  Through their launch event back in November of last year, I had the pleasure of speaking  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:04):**  with Richard Perkins in Sweden, who is the co-owner and director of Rydgdale Permaculture  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:09):**  and the leading expert and educator on small-scale regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:14):**  Patrick Worms from Belgium, the Senior Science Policy Advisor at World Agroforestry, President  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:20):**  of the European Agroforestry Federation and Trustee of the International Union of Agroforestry.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:26):**  And the third panelist, Benedict Büzel from Germany, the Managing Director of GUT and  
**[0:01:30-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:30):**  Büzel, Board Member of Soil Alliance, Chairman of the AgTech platform Bundesverband Deutsch  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:38):**  Startup EV.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:39):**  I hope I pronounced that right, I have no idea.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:42):**  In this episode, we discuss each of their visions for a regenerative agriculture future,  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:47):**  and just as importantly, how they think it could be actualized.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:51):**  From there we break down the current obstacles to those visions, the essential steps forward,  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:01:56):**  and how everyone can participate in advancing regenerative farming practices wherever they  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:00):**  live.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:01):**  The best part about these panels, for me at least, is that it's not just about me getting  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:05):**  my own questions answered, but I get to see what these people speak about amongst themselves  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:10):**  and how they relate their ideas between one another.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:14):**  Now remember, if you want to be involved in these chats in the future, the Discord chat  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:18):**  room that I host will always be free, and all you need to do to participate is to follow  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:22):**  the links at regenerativeskills.com.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:27):**  So with that out of the way, let's get things started.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:30):**  All right, welcome gentlemen, it's great to speak with each of you again.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:34):**  Now to start our discussion today, I'd like to understand what could a regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:39):**  future look like specifically for Europe?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:42):**  And what's the vision that you have that you would hope to see realized in the near future?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:49):**  If we could start out with Richard.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:50):**  Okay, hey, Oliver, nice to see you again.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:55):**  Hi, everyone.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:02:56):**  For me, I guess what I'm interested in and what got me interested in this whole thing  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:01):**  is to see communities that are supported by small farms.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:07):**  And this idea, something I really took from Keyline Design, which has been a big influence  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:11):**  on my career, is the idea of farm independence of water.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:17):**  And we see all around the world, these big mega dams supported by the IMF and the World  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:22):**  Bank and often displacing hundreds of thousands, up to a million people in one go, with the  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:29):**  promise of water access and relocation to other lands, and then never actually getting  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:34):**  those things.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:35):**  But we don't need those big mega dams, we need 1000s of small water resources governing  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:44):**  the living populations.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:46):**  And I see farms in the same light as that we need 100 or 1000 small farms around the  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:52):**  city producing its food and reintegrating the resource base around the people that are  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:03:59):**  gathered in that watershed, hopefully.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:02):**  One of my great ambitions was to write a book in a kind of wistful way about a keyline plan  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:09):**  for the whole of the United Kingdom.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:11):**  That was going to be like my parting gift to the world.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:16):**  But this kind of thinking of like how to section up the land and resource base to the population  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:23):**  centres and that's how I'd like to see the future.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:26):**  The future I'd like my kids to grow up in is real food security where farms around the  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:31):**  population base are supplying the majority of the food needs for those places, rather  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:38):**  than big mega industrial farms providing commodities on a very abstract global market and there's  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:45):**  no real food security there.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:48):**  So that's my yeah, that's what I would like to see is lots more small farms taking and  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:04:54):**  working together interdependently, you know, not trying to be an isolated island, but starting  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:00):**  to communicate and to work together in a different way.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:03):**  And I think that's the next step for these small regenerative farms is how do we work  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:08):**  together in a much more cohesive way.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:11):**  Benedict would you like to build upon that statement?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:14):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:15):**  First of all, thanks for the invitation and hi to everybody.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:20):**  I think you know what we really have to take into consideration instead of the context  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:26):**  and location specifically of farming, right, because the needs and the situations are just  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:33):**  so fundamentally different from place to place, not only from the sort of soil and climate  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:39):**  factors, but also from the kind of values that you have, the kind of machinery that  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:44):**  you have, the kind of risk return profiles you have and so forth.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:47):**  And I think this is something that we really have to keep in mind.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:50):**  And I think in addition to that, of course, we have to talk about somehow forms of support  
**[0:05:57-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:05:57):**  so some sort of subsidization programs and I think my ideal, let's say vision of agriculture  
**[0:06:06-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:06):**  in Europe would be to not only, let's say, monitor and monetize the true cost of the  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:13):**  production, but also think about the real values that are already being created by different  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:18):**  farming methods, because I think this will bring a natural energy and movement towards  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:24):**  farming methodologies that actually do carry account of the soil and the biodiversity and  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:29):**  the nutrient density of food and so forth.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:31):**  And I think technology brings in such an amazing potential to really overcome some of the things  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:38):**  that we weren't at all possible to monitor.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:42):**  And I think technology, if it's not being developed out of an expletive understanding  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:48):**  of ecosystems, it can actually help us immensely in finding ways and helping farmers to really  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:06:54):**  to find their context and location specific ways of agriculture that, let's say, as the  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:00):**  least common denominator can, you know, at least build soil.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:07):**  And then of course, you have the differences of it, which go more into biodiversity, but  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:11):**  always in relation to, you know, the potential that you have on your specific areas.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:17):**  Very well said.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:18):**  And we do have Patrick here now.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:20):**  So Patrick, since you joined us a little late, let me repeat the question that we had.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:24):**  Which was, we're discussing what could a regenerative agriculture future in Europe look like?  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:31):**  And what vision do you have to see it realized?  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:36):**  Thanks Oliver, and sorry for being late.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:39):**  I think that I'm not interested in the vision of what the future will look like, because  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:46):**  we don't know enough to understand what a perfectly regenerative landscape management  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:52):**  system that provides us with the food and the fiber and the timber we need while respecting  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:07:57):**  planetary boundaries will actually look like.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:00):**  But what we do know is the general direction of travel.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:04):**  And so what's interesting for me is the journey of how we get from where we are today to where  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:09):**  we need to be.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:10):**  And there is two aspects to that journey.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:13):**  The first aspect to the journey is one that most of us are probably concerned about.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:18):**  And this is an aspect to the journey of what I would call specialty farming.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:23):**  Horticulture, fruits, livestock, eggs, milk, making cheese, that sort of thing.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:33):**  That kind of farming is easier to transform because it has more value added.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:38):**  It's easier to make money from that.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:40):**  But where the real problem lies is in the vast tracts of the landscapes across Europe  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:45):**  and North America and Ukraine and elsewhere that are covered with these giant fields of  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:49):**  monoclonal cereals and rapeseed and corn and whatever.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:55):**  And there I'd just like to share a story.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:08:56):**  A few years ago I was cycling, I live in Brussels, I was cycling from Brussels to visit friends  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:00):**  in Normandy and we crossed an area of France called the Artois.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:05):**  It's south of the Belgian border, between the Belgian border and Normandy.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:10):**  Vast landscapes of really, really rich soil.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:14):**  And that soil was a curse of the entire area because that area had become death personified.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:20):**  First the First World War went through.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:22):**  So all the buildings, all the villages were rebuilt in the 1920s with the cheapest materials  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:27):**  available back then.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:28):**  It doesn't look great.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:29):**  Second, all the farms died and were replaced by giant fields with very few farmers because  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:36):**  with modern farming it's easy to manage enormous tracts of land with machinery and one individual.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:43):**  And what that means is that society collapsed because the minimum density of people in that  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:48):**  landscape dropped too low for things like schools or shops or cafes or churches to survive.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:55):**  So the villages died.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:09:57):**  And so now the people are leaving because no person of your generation will want to  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:02):**  stay in that landscape to farm your father's land simply because it will be impossible  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:08):**  for you to settle down and have a family.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:09):**  There are no shops, there are no schools.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:11):**  It's like living on the bloody moon.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:13):**  And so all the young people are leaving and the old people are staying and they're getting  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:17):**  cancers and they're dying.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:19):**  And when they die, their land goes to giant corporations who don't care that the landscape  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:23):**  looks like a desert because they are managing hundreds of thousands of hectares like that  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:28):**  in one go from the comfort of an office in a city.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:31):**  That is a much more difficult problem to solve than the first kind of problem.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:35):**  So you asked me, what does the future look like?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:38):**  That I don't know.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:39):**  But I know one thing.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:40):**  I know that the journey has to start with the lived experience of the farmer.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:45):**  And that right now the farmers who are suffering the most, the farmers whose suicide rates  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:50):**  are the highest, the farmers who are those farmers who we all love to hate, the farmers  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:10:57):**  on the big farms in the empty landscapes who for the last 20 years have gone down the wrong  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:02):**  road of becoming ever more efficient, getting ever bigger machinery, depending ever more  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:08):**  on the cleverness that is to be found in some engineered seed or a bag of fertilizer.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:13):**  If we can find a way of making the troubles that these farmers are facing our own, if  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:20):**  we can find a way of helping these farmers change their farming practices so that again  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:25):**  more people want to live in that landscape, so that again the young want to take over  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:28):**  the businesses of their parents, so that again you can get jobs and schools, then perhaps  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:34):**  we will be moving in the right direction because an ancillary impact of that is that those  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:38):**  soils will also have more carbon.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:40):**  There will also be more biodiversity in those landscapes.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:43):**  There is also going to be better management of water and nutrition flows in those landscapes.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:48):**  So that's how I look at it.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:49):**  I look at it as a sociological problem rather than as a purely biophysical problem.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:54):**  Yeah, certainly there are a lot of different ways that you can come at this and it's a  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:11:58):**  great story that illustrates that the assets that are on the land are not necessarily going  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:05):**  to create healthy communities and industries out of them.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:09):**  It seems to me that there are a lot of strange incentives in the market right now.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:13):**  I used to work in farming, though I've been removed from it for a couple of years.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:17):**  Both Richard and Benedict, you are currently working in farming directly and I'm wondering  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:24):**  what are some of the incentives that are keeping farmers from going into regenerative practices  
**[0:12:30-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:30):**  even when many of them want to work with nature and improve the fertility and the biodiversity  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:38):**  on their landscape.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:40):**  There are many different reasons why that's not very practical for a lot of farmers at  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:45):**  the moment.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:46):**  Benedict, perhaps starting with you, could you speak on some of those strange incentives  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:50):**  that are keeping people from doing what they're trying to accomplish?  
**[0:12:53-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:12:53):**  Sure, I mean, I'll try to give you my view on things but then also, you know, I don't  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:01):**  know anyone's situation.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:03):**  I can only speak for myself and tell you what I observe and this might be part of the truth  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:08):**  but never the full picture.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:11):**  So a situation that most farmers in our area is in is that they are fighting for their  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:16):**  lives, right?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:17):**  So, Falkert-Engelsmann, the CEO of Maoster, always says you cannot think green if your  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:23):**  figures are red, right?  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:24):**  So if you have low precipitation and sandy soil and you're not very profitable as a farming  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:30):**  company, you know, you cannot expect them to change suddenly all out of it just because  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:35):**  they understand that, you know, we have to do more for animal welfare.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:40):**  And this is, you know, a lot of farmers around the world, I think.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:43):**  And you have a different group, they have, or they seem to have very good soil and just  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:50):**  the right amount of water.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:52):**  So they are actually quite, you know, they are earning quite a lot of money and they  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:56):**  get subsidies on top of that.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:13:58):**  So they don't really feel the need nor the interest in changing their practices, right?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:05):**  And then I think you have, and this is probably the biggest group, the big, the group in between  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:11):**  and irrespective of whatever system they're running, be it ecologically or conventional,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:16):**  I think they have realized and they understand that so much is changing, not only, let's  
**[0:14:22-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:22):**  say the climatic situation, but also people's wishes and needs with regard to food and how  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:30):**  we treat the planet and animals and so forth.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:34):**  But they have been brought and this over the last 20 years into a system where they are  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:40):**  supposed to be compatible on the world market.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:44):**  And that has meant investment, investment, investment in technology, specialization,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:51):**  they have built stables, whatever.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:54):**  And so that means many of them, if not most, are already incredibly in debt.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:14:59):**  And the bank doesn't care if you suddenly want to become more ecologically, let's say  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:05):**  viable in a sense that you change your operation, but you know, they are going to ask the end  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:10):**  of the community on a quarterly basis.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:12):**  And if you have operating costs that are that high, you are just stuck in the system.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:17):**  And, you know, I think even conventional farmers are far, far beyond what we from the media  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:26):**  always seem to think, because they're already testing biological alternatives.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:30):**  They're already trying nurse crops, cover crops and so forth, because none of them,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:36):**  you know, is doing things to actively wanting to harm the animals or the planet.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:41):**  They have been, they're doing the best that they can in their respective situations.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:45):**  And I think one thing that you shouldn't, I always tend to remind myself of is that,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:52):**  you know, they, and I mean, the average age of farmers, I think in Germany is about 50  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:15:58):**  in America, and it's over 60.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:00):**  You know, they have grown up to large parts having to help as 80 year old kids on the  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:06):**  field of their parents doing hay.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:08):**  And they do hold the hay in a sense where they had things in, on the grassland, which  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:18):**  actually hurt their fingers a lot, right?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:21):**  And then suddenly there was something that made them not having to do this anymore.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:25):**  So there was some herbicide, for example, or there was some other technological advances  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:31):**  that for them in that sort of phase was an incredible movement forwards, right?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:36):**  I mean, now looking back, it was always a way of fighting the symptoms.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:40):**  And we're doing this today with digitalization in many forms as well.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:44):**  But I think you always have to think about how we actually came from.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:49):**  And if we acknowledge that they have always trying to do the best they can, the question  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:53):**  today is not saying, well, the farmers are doing it wrong, and they should be doing this  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:56):**  and they should be doing that.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:16:58):**  No, it's more like what can we as society and this includes politicians, science, includes  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:04):**  us as people who eat and buy, what can we do for farmers, what can we do to help farmers  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:11):**  actually transition into a farming methodologies where we actually accept the plants' boundaries?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:17):**  I very much agree with that statement.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:20):**  I hope that throughout this entire thing, we give the impression that we're here to  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:26):**  try and help and support the people who are making these transitions and those who desire  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:30):**  to as well.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:31):**  I completely agree that farmers are very hard working up against quite a lot of barriers.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:37):**  Richard, could you explain a little bit more from your perspective?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:40):**  Because I know one of the things that you've taught from a lot is understanding the unique  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:46):**  context that anybody might be working from and using that as a basis for application  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:52):**  for development of farms and the economies that support them.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:55):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:17:56):**  I guess my response touches on many things that have been said already and that we will  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:03):**  speak more about, no doubt.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:05):**  But to contextualize my context, I'm not in the business of talking to people who aren't  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:15):**  coming to me, as it were.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:17):**  I wouldn't recommend anyone trying to convince someone else how to do something.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:23):**  I think that's quite important because everyone's out there doing their best in their context.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:32):**  Having said that, educational literacy around ecosystem processes and managing complexity  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:41):**  is perhaps the biggest weakness I see across the farming community.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:46):**  Farmers are not trained to make decisions in the face of complexity.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:52):**  And my experience of agriculture school is that the sons and daughters of farmers are  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:18:57):**  essentially learning how to maintain machinery and application rates and things like this.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:04):**  And that's not farming.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:06):**  That's the work of a technician.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:08):**  That's not even farming.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:10):**  And so education is obviously a big thing.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:14):**  But I learned very early in my consulting career not to, you know, I'm not out to try  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:19):**  and convince anyone to do anything differently.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:21):**  I think that's smacking your head against a wall and taking aspirin to deal with a headache.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:27):**  It's a flawed approach.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:29):**  I think like extending on what Patrick was saying a bit, like we're dealing with the  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:35):**  climate of the mind and that's the hardest bit to shift.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:40):**  And I think pride and arrogance is a big part of it.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:43):**  Like pride and arrogance.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:45):**  My grandfather did it like this.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:47):**  My father did it like this.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:48):**  And that's why we do it like this.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:50):**  You know, there's so many disastrous farming practices that are just based on lack of knowledge.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:19:59):**  And I think that, yeah, education is a big part of my own pathway.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:06):**  But I think it's, it needs to be very carefully tuned to time, place and circumstance.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:17):**  And I don't know how you address that on a society wide scale, because it doesn't work  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:22):**  like that.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:23):**  And that's the problem with our institutions also, which by nature and through history,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:27):**  are only moving with public opinion.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:30):**  And you know, the leaders in this field are generally not coming out of institutions,  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:35):**  all of the farmers that inspire me didn't go to agricultural schools.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:41):**  And that says, you know, there's a lot to reflect on there.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:45):**  But from an economic climatic perspective, I have quite a different view to Benedict.  
**[0:20:51-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:20:51):**  I think, you know, there's a lot to be said for the hustling spirit of entrepreneurship,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:00):**  you know.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:01):**  If you're a commodity farmer producing a commodity crop, then you know, you're setting yourself  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:07):**  up for bad business, essentially.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:10):**  I mean, I always think about this dairy farm that set up the same month we set up our farm  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:16):**  about four kilometres down the road, and they are a typical modern dairy, they've invested  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:22):**  10 million euros.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:24):**  It's a robotic, fully modern dairy where animals are not outside and forage is bought to the  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:30):**  animals and they win awards for the highest production per cow.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:34):**  And from a banking, modern banking perspective, it's a good business because they turn over  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:38):**  a huge amount of money, but it costs them such a high amount to produce a commodity  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:44):**  that they have no control over the price over.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:47):**  And now a small little farm that started the same year is far, far more profitable from  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:53):**  any economic standpoint.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:55):**  It just doesn't look good from a banking perspective, because we're not in debt to anyone.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:21:59):**  OK, so I'm you know, I'm representing small farmers, but I'm interested in that interface  
**[0:22:07-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:22:07):**  between small scale regenerative agriculture and interfacing with commodity farmers, because  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:22:16):**  they're two different worlds, essentially.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:22:19):**  And you know, farmers are renowned for victim mentality, and I think subsidies and looking  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:22:31):**  at these sort of things is this is where I disagree with Benedict a bit.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:22:36):**  It's like, I don't know if I want to see funding and subsidies for good farming, because I  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:22:42):**  think there's a lot to be said for a new breed of farmers that are hustling, that are entrepreneurs.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:22:49):**  And we've demonstrated this and hundreds of other people are demonstrating this, that  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:22:54):**  it's almost like you disadvantage yourself if you don't have to make strategic business  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:00):**  decisions.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:02):**  And this is the problem with mainstream commercial commodity farming is when you subsidize farmers,  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:08):**  you take away their responsibility.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:10):**  And I'm speaking very simply and very plainly about it.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:13):**  But it's it's the quickest way you could force people to make responsible decisions is stop  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:21):**  subsidizing farmers.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:23):**  Now, it's obviously not that simple, but that would be the quickest route to change because  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:28):**  people can't afford to run businesses that don't work.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:32):**  And let's face it, most modern agriculture does not work.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:36):**  It's as simple as that.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:37):**  It does not work.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:39):**  And so what are the models that do work?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:41):**  And we have plenty of them.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:43):**  And how do we scale and replicate those?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:45):**  And ultimately, it looks like a lot more small farms.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:50):**  But I don't know if I want to see small farms getting funding.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:53):**  I've been reflecting on the points that I hope we talk about this evening, which for  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:23:57):**  me, the things that need to be addressed for the wider engagement of regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:04):**  education, access to land, dealing with regulations that are archaic and written for industrial  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:10):**  processing and finance is another thing.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:14):**  But I'm really not up for financing farming.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:19):**  I think people need to design businesses that work.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:22):**  And if they can't, they shouldn't be farming.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:24):**  They shouldn't be in control of that land.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:27):**  That might be, you know.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:29):**  Yeah, I guess that's going a bit upstream.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:31):**  But that's that's how I feel about it.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:34):**  And I hope we can unpack those things a bit.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:38):**  If I may, I think Richard's put his finger on two very important things here.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:41):**  The first is the current subsidy regime is an absolute nightmare.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:46):**  It is a nightmare because it keeps a lot of farmers suckling at a public teat, where they  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:53):**  are unable to take strategic decisions.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:55):**  But it is even more of a nightmare because the rules and regulations attached to that  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:24:59):**  to those subsidies are so complicated and prevents farmers from truly innovating.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:02):**  Right.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:03):**  So we're the president of the European Anglophoristry Federation.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:06):**  We know we've got the science.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:07):**  We've got decades of studies to prove that you can completely revolutionize your farming  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:11):**  systems, make it more resilient, more efficient, better for the planet, whatever you like.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:15):**  If you simply start mixing it up with trees, but you might lose your pillar one payments.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:21):**  And so people don't do it.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:22):**  So in an ideal world, I think we would all agree it would be much better if they win  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:26):**  with subsidies.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:27):**  But we do not live in an ideal world.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:28):**  We live in a world in which subsidies are going to continue being paid.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:31):**  And so right now, the good farmers are competing against bad farmers whose lack of good farming  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:38):**  is subsidized.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:40):**  And I would much rather have the subsidies flow into the pockets of the good farmers  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:43):**  than flow into the pockets of the bad farmers.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:46):**  And there we reach the second problem that you alluded to earlier in your talk, which  
**[0:25:51-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:51):**  is that right now, farming as an idea is completely controlled by the only part of the farming  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:25:59):**  value chain that is making money hand over fist.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:03):**  And that part are the seed breeders, the fertilizer makers, the pesticides and herbicide sellers.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:09):**  It's an oligopoly of less than a dozen companies worldwide that are selling to every commercial  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:14):**  farmer around the world.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:15):**  The profits are measured in tens of billions of dollars a year.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:19):**  And a significant proportion of these profits are used to ensure, one, that the profits  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:24):**  keep flowing, which means an enormous amount of lobbying, which means writing legislation,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:28):**  which means convincing leaders in parliament and in government that this is the only way  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:35):**  to farm.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:36):**  And the way you do that is not even by lying.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:39):**  The way you do that is simply by controlling the discourse.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:42):**  When you have that much money, your controller gets taught in the universities.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:45):**  Your controller appears in the farming magazines.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:48):**  Hell, in a number of European countries, the farming cooperatives, the bodies supposed  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:52):**  to represent farmers are selling this stuff and have in effect become part of that machinery.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:26:58):**  We know the agroforestors, the permaculturists, the holistic grazers, all the regenerative  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:03):**  agriculturalists, these hundreds of different kinds of farming that are being trialled across  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:09):**  our continent and worldwide, that these things work better.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:14):**  They generate more resilience.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:17):**  They cost much less to put in place.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:19):**  As Richard said, you end up being more profitable, even though you invest a lot less money.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:24):**  But getting that message out in an environment which is completely controlled by an industry  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:28):**  that has an interest in getting farmers to borrow 10 million euros to put in place a  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:34):**  robotic dairy shed in which the cows never go out is always going to be difficult.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:40):**  So the question is not which farming system is better or worse.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:43):**  The question is, how do you get the message out into a landscape in which subsidies encourage  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:49):**  you to farm badly and in which the discourse is controlled by an industry that encourages  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:27:54):**  you to feed badly in order to get more farmers to dip their toes in the pool and try to do  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:01):**  things a little bit differently?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:02):**  That to me is a fundamental question.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:06):**  Before we move on to another topic, Benedict, would you like to respond to some of those  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:09):**  statements?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:10):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:11):**  I mean, I don't think necessarily that, you know, my opinion is that different to Richard's  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:21):**  with regard to, you know, in a perfect world, I'm not a fan of subsidies at all.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:26):**  But we have to acknowledge that we live in the system that we live in.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:30):**  And we have to acknowledge that the farmers that are in that system, they are caught in  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:35):**  the system, and they cannot just simply switch that.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:39):**  And it takes new knowledge, it takes new forms of investment, it takes new forms of being  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:45):**  able to talk about the products that you produce.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:49):**  And it just requires a huge new set of skills, like a new skill set.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:28:57):**  And if you've been doing this for many years, there's also an emotional factor in thinking,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:04):**  rethinking the way that you see what you're doing.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:07):**  Because if you suddenly change or your knowledge to change out of your system, this in line  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:13):**  or in a sense means that you are saying, well, you know, this what my grandfather or my father  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:20):**  or me have been doing for 20, 25 years, it wasn't that good.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:25):**  And this is something that on a personal individual perspective, I don't think many of us here  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:31):**  in this round, I would be very happy to do so, right.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:34):**  So there is a huge emotional aspect to it also.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:38):**  And I think, you know, it is a challenging world that we've kind of navigated ourselves  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:45):**  into.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:46):**  And I always think, you know, the question is not like, how do we, you know, how do we  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:54):**  convince other people?  
**[0:29:55-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:29:55):**  It's how what are sort of the tools that we can use in order to basically build a narrative  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:03):**  that draws them into the right direction.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:06):**  And I think the subsidy program is not something that is perfect, but it could be rigged in  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:10):**  certain areas that will help us moving into a direction because we would pay for certain  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:16):**  things that we believe are a good thing to pay for.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:20):**  And I mean, to keep it simple, I mean, we are a big farm.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:24):**  But what I have been doing or what our team is doing, you know, we are investing, but  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:29):**  we are investing in soil, in trees and animals and in humans.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:34):**  And I think this is our way of becoming, you know, a farm that becomes more resilient with  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:39):**  regards to not only the climatic situation, but also with regards to more products being  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:45):**  more diverse, increasing biodiversity and so forth and using nature in the sense that  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:50):**  it will always help us.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:30:52):**  But I think, you know, we just need to have more of the different, let's say, data points.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:00):**  We need more sort of the scientific community because we have huge structural problems.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:06):**  It's not only the farmers, it's the scientific community that today is mostly either, let's  
**[0:31:13-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:13):**  say, looked at through English citations or citations in English speaking journals, or  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:20):**  they are sort of valued by looking at how many capital they source from third parties.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:28):**  And that capital doesn't come from, in most parts, doesn't come from a family farm in  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:34):**  Obama-gal, but it comes from the industry.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:37):**  So there's a huge area of, let's say, the whole structural farming world that we are  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:45):**  in and we have to change all of it at the same time, if possible.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:50):**  And the question is which step to go first.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:54):**  I wonder Oliver, can I say a few things Sam?  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:57):**  Yeah, go ahead.  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:58):**  By all means.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:31:59):**  Thanks.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:00):**  Yeah, I feel like I can totally resonate with what both Benedict and Patrick are saying.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:06):**  I think it needs a bit of systems thinking approach to try and organise the network of  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:14):**  who are the right people for the right job, because we need people empowered at every  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:20):**  level of this.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:21):**  Like, my role is very specifically with getting particularly young people into small scale  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:28):**  profitable farming.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:30):**  That's my job and I'm not so interested in sitting on the board and talking to people  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:35):**  that write regulations.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:36):**  That's not my role.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:38):**  I see the need for it, of course, but there's a need to organise our wider network to position  
**[0:32:47-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:47):**  the right people for the right tasks in those places because it strikes me that a lot of  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:55):**  these things are more malleable than they might appear.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:32:59):**  And I'd like to just bring up a few examples of that, specifically around regulations.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:06):**  And I find it really interesting to see how simple and yet frustratingly difficult those  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:16):**  things are to move.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:18):**  But let me speak of a few examples and I hope that that will bring some hope to folks.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:24):**  You know, I know a lot of people, especially Germans, have got incredibly hard regulations  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:29):**  to deal with.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:31):**  But when I moved to Sweden, I set up enterprises that are quite common in the States and other  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:37):**  places.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:38):**  But Sweden, I would say, is 20 years behind the rest of Europe.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:42):**  And so the pastured poultry enterprises we ran here had not been run.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:46):**  No one had even played around with those ideas.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:50):**  And when we set up eggmobiles, for example, there's been a whole lot of issues that different  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:33:55):**  people around Europe have had copying that model and pushing up against regulations specifically  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:03):**  around scratching space under their eggmobiles.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:06):**  And I know Germans particularly have an issue with this.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:09):**  But this year we had a training around passive poultry where 15 Swedish producers came and  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:18):**  we got to sit down and really talk about the nuances of regulations.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:22):**  And what transpired is that Sweden is now changing its regulations around the supposed  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:29):**  scratch space on the eggmobiles that are totally unnecessary.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:33):**  They're needed in industrial barn settings, but they're totally unnecessary in an eggmobile  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:38):**  setting where birds are outside all day and come in to sleep.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:42):**  For example, you have to have food and water in their shelters.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:46):**  But in reality, our birds only go inside when they're asleep.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:49):**  So they have no need for water or food.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:51):**  That's just totally nonsense.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:54):**  You know, they're not eating or drinking at night.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:34:57):**  And what's happened is that they've actually started rewriting the regulations.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:04):**  And last month and the month before they've updated their policies.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:09):**  And that has only come about because we moved here, set up eggmobiles and 50 other people  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:14):**  copied that.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:15):**  Right.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:16):**  So that regulation is shifting and that's not nothing.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:21):**  And then another story from this summer talking with a lady that runs an organic meat distribution  
**[0:35:27-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:27):**  company who sits on the board for like organic farmers who does who they talk to the government  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:36):**  and bodies.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:37):**  They had an interesting story where here in Sweden, obviously, it's very cold in the winter,  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:42):**  long, deep snows.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:44):**  And we have a regulation.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:47):**  We have EU regulations and then we have Swedish regulations on top of it.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:50):**  But we have a rule that all animals must have access to indoor spaces all year round.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:57):**  Which is totally nonsense.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:35:59):**  And we have hardy species here that actually don't want to be inside.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:03):**  So we have hardy native pigs, cows, sheep that choose to be outside the whole year.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:08):**  And if you give them a shelter, they never even use it.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:12):**  So this has been something that the organic farming bodies have been trying to push against  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:18):**  governments to say, hey, we need to change this.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:21):**  And interestingly, the all the parties in Swedish government said, yeah, we'll change  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:29):**  this except one who only got the notes for the meeting the night before voting.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:34):**  And so they just they stood against it because they hadn't read it.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:40):**  And that just shows how fickle sometimes these processes are.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:45):**  And I could say the same about the slaughter we built on our farm, which is Europe's cheapest  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:50):**  approved slaughter facilities that's opened up the doors for dozens of other farms to  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:56):**  do that.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:36:57):**  And the reason I'm saying this is that some of these regulatory things are very malleable  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:03):**  and it needs people on the ground changing and actually just doing it.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:08):**  And people that are smarter than their inspectors who are willing to treat their regulators  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:14):**  and inspectors like colleagues and part of their community.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:19):**  When I set up our farm, I knew there were two routes.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:22):**  We could follow the Joel Steller and American route and try and work around regulations.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:28):**  Or we could say, hey, these are people that are in our community and they're part of our  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:32):**  world and we can treat them with the respect of we treat anyone.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:36):**  And that's proven to be a better way to build a business and more successfully socially  
**[0:37:44-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:44):**  too.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:45):**  But likewise, I think that's the layer and level that I'm working on and that's needed  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:50):**  too.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:51):**  And then we need that at the people sitting at the board level talking in between farmers  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:57):**  and government, et cetera.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:37:59):**  We need people at all those levels.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:01):**  We need one or the other.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:03):**  We need all of it.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:04):**  And that's something important to think about, I think.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:07):**  It's a very good point.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:08):**  And it kind of brings me to what I was going to ask, which is with so many different factors  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:14):**  influencing the farming community and the farming industry.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:18):**  We talked about larger agribusiness, commodity crop prices, regulation from governments.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:24):**  It starts to become sort of a chicken or the egg question as to what influences what first  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:29):**  or what can start the ball rolling in order to influence the culture of farming and the  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:33):**  industry at large into shifting into something that is much more ecologically sustainable  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:38):**  or ideally regenerative.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:41):**  Perhaps Patrick, could you give us some insight onto what you think is the starting point  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:45):**  or what is the linchpin that needs to begin to move in order to see larger change within  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:50):**  the culture?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:51):**  It's an interesting one.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:54):**  It's really a chicken and egg question.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:38:58):**  I would say almost always it starts with understanding and knowledge.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:02):**  What Richard pointed out is that he came to Sweden and he introduced his egg mobiles,  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:06):**  which nobody had ever seen before, because they're obviously a great idea and they work.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:10):**  People started copying it at the same time he was talking to regulators to change the  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:13):**  regulations to authorise his new method of production in that context.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:18):**  The key here is that you had a farmer, Richard, that was already equipped with the right degree  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:23):**  of knowledge and who also had the social skills to socialise that knowledge amongst other  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:27):**  producers in his landscape.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:29):**  And I would say very often that that is what is missing.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:31):**  Benedict made that point, Richard made that point that right now when you go to agricultural  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:37):**  college, you are basically being trained to be a glorified technician that knows how to  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:41):**  fix a tractor, which is great.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:42):**  You do need to know how to fix a tractor, but there's a lot more to farming than that,  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:46):**  right?  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:47):**  And this bit, there is a lot more to farming than that is what is usually missing.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:51):**  So I would very much encourage the people with an influence on the educational system  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:39:59):**  to ensure that much more space is made in the curricula at agricultural schools, agricultural  
**[0:40:05-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:05):**  colleges and indeed universities to study the way ecosystems function, the way agro  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:12):**  ecosystems have to be managed, the way that different components of agro ecosystems interact  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:18):**  with one another and the way they do so dynamically, not only across the seasons, but also in the  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:23):**  changing climates.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:24):**  You need to equip people with the knowledge tools they need to be able to read their land  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:30):**  so that their first reaction is not to reach for the machine or reach for the sprayer,  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:36):**  but their first reaction is to try to understand what's going on and how they could tweak their  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:40):**  system and what is happening on their land to minimize the need for further intervention.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:46):**  If you start with that educational component, you will have everybody having at least a  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:50):**  basic understanding in the landscape of what agroecological approaches actually mean in  
**[0:40:55-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:40:55):**  practice and then you end up in the situation where you will, as usual, have a bell curve  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:03):**  with some farmers who are more entrepreneurial and other farmers who are less entrepreneurial  
**[0:41:07-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:07):**  and those who are more entrepreneurial are going to give it a go.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:10):**  Those who are more entrepreneurial are going to start playing with the agmobiles and all  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:13):**  the rest of it and they are going to encourage those that surround them.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:20):**  If you do that and if that happens at scale, then the inspectors, the regulators, the private  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:26):**  sector buyers, the value chain actors will begin to understand that these are techniques  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:30):**  that are promising and they will stop standing in the way and they will start becoming partners.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:35):**  Now obviously I'm painting an idealized picture of what needs to happen, but a lot of the  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:41):**  work that we do professionally is actually in poorer countries, in Africa and Asia, and  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:47):**  paradoxically the advantages that you have there is the fact that there are no subsidies  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:52):**  and that very often there are no regulations.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:41:54):**  So farmers can be a lot more innovative than they are in Europe in terms of trying out  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:00):**  something.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:01):**  And what we find is that once you have some farmers in the landscape that know what they  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:05):**  are doing and that do it well, then through processes of social diffusion surrounding  
**[0:42:10-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:10):**  producers start adopting these techniques and try to copy them.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:13):**  The same thing can happen in Europe if you make sure that this knowledge spreads and  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:17):**  I'm glad to see that we're 85 participants today, but if European farming realized how  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:23):**  important this debate was, it wouldn't be 85 participants tonight, it would be 85,000  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:29):**  participants tonight.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:30):**  I don't know if we have the bandwidth for that, but we'll try to get there.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:36):**  Benedict, what about you?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:37):**  Can you tell us about some of the factors that you've seen that could help to move this  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:42):**  initiative along that perhaps not everybody else is thinking about or are not as large  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:49):**  a part of the discussion?  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:50):**  I think the one thing that I observe on a very regular basis is, you know, I think the  
**[0:42:57-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:42:57):**  most important part is how do we get producers or farmers out of their head race, right?  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:06):**  Like how can you find a space where they actually have the emotional freedom to take a step  
**[0:43:12-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:12):**  back and think about what they're doing and the profitability of it and where they have  
**[0:43:19-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:19):**  the potential to change that thing?  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:21):**  Because this is a phenomenon that we see in every industry.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:25):**  Why is one more innovative than the other?  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:29):**  Because they understand that doing nothing could mean you become much more productive,  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:34):**  that doing nothing would mean you can actually think about what you're really doing.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:38):**  And I think one aspect of that is having places, having farms all around the world in the different  
**[0:43:48-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:48):**  climatic situations with different sort of, let's say, different foci of production that  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:43:55):**  you can use for farmers to come and feel and touch and understand and actually emotionally  
**[0:44:02-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:02):**  live through and then see it.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:04):**  Because I think you have to sort of have that emotional inspiration that you can say, all  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:11):**  right, okay, I understand it.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:13):**  This makes complete sense.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:14):**  And this is the funny thing.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:15):**  The farmers that come to our place, for example, once they start seeing it, they're like, oh,  
**[0:44:20-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:20):**  wow, yeah, okay, right?  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:21):**  And I think that is really important.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:23):**  The best example is we have Anantiketan, some of the climate farmers here are aware of,  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:29):**  which we gave land to.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:30):**  And they are a couple that haven't been in farming beforehand, but they started doing  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:35):**  a market gardening on 2.4 hectares of all land.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:40):**  And it's incredible what they have done.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:43):**  It is beautiful what they have achieved and what they have built and the produce that  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:47):**  me and my family get.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:48):**  It has such an incredible value.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:52):**  Economically wise, it doesn't make that much sense for us as a farm, but that's just a  
**[0:44:56-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:56):**  side argument.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:44:58):**  But the interesting thing is that they have been looking for land for three years around  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:02):**  Berlin and they couldn't find anything.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:03):**  And then we met and actually it continued in a sense that we now work together.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:08):**  And now I have farmers, the same farmers that told them, no, I'm not giving you any land.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:13):**  And they come, they see it and they're like, oh, that's beautiful.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:16):**  Can you do this at my place?  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:17):**  Do you have any friends who can do it at my place?  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:19):**  And it's just this one moment, one second, taking them out of their actual thinking and  
**[0:45:24-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:24):**  showing them something new.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:25):**  And they're like, oh yeah, it makes total sense.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:26):**  So I think that experiencing and emotional going through that process is a key thing.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:32):**  And then of course, and this shouldn't be underestimated as well.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:36):**  We just need more sort of average calculations, average sort of in Germany, we have this company  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:44):**  called Quatorium Führer, whatever, Bauwissen.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:47):**  It just has basically averages of any form of production you can possibly think of.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:52):**  So if I'm doing agroforestry system with plums and pears, and I don't know, something which  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:45:56):**  is between what kind of hours do I have to calculate having to collect the seeds in order  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:01):**  to plant the seeds?  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:03):**  How many meters do I need?  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:05):**  How many people, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:06):**  So you can actually, when you plan and you think about it, you actually have some real  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:11):**  values you can work with.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:12):**  You can sort of use in order to find the concept for your area.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:17):**  Because as of today, especially in Germany, it's such a leap of faith.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:21):**  You not only have to basically be able to not wanting to take the subsidies, but you  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:28):**  also have to basically do research and development because there's not that much there yet available  
**[0:46:34-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:34):**  in the German context.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:35):**  And I think this is going to be crucial as well.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:37):**  So it's the average values and average calculation basis on one side, and it's like finding that  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:44):**  space, that emotional freedom where they actually can emotionally live through some examples  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:49):**  of what you can actually do.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:53):**  Now I know all of you have played a big role in helping to disseminate some of this information  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:46:58):**  and educate others on the potential of what can happen to your farm business in adopting  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:04):**  these ecological practices.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:06):**  Perhaps starting with Richard, because you've been so prominent in this role as an educator  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:09):**  through your Farm Like a Hero experience, which I've been on as well and got a lot out  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:14):**  of.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:15):**  Can you talk about what it means to communicate the potential of regenerative farming and  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:21):**  running this as a community service business that makes a meaningful income for the people  
**[0:47:28-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:28):**  who practice it?  
**[0:47:30-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:30):**  I think that comes out mostly in the smaller spheres of the people we interact with.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:36):**  I think it's why I've always focused on the numbers and the books I've written have been  
**[0:47:40-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:40):**  so detailed in time, emotion studies and financials, because it's, you know, certainly interacting  
**[0:47:50-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:50):**  with the youth of today.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:52):**  I mean, I still feel like a kid, but when I meet people 10, 15 years younger than me,  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:47:58):**  I see that they're growing up in a very, very different world to what I grew up in.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:04):**  And indeed, the skills required to farm successfully today are a million miles away from a generation.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:10):**  They go, you know, and I think that the point that I hit on very early on was that I need  
**[0:48:20-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:20):**  to demonstrate viable economy to young people or why the hell would they want to take on  
**[0:48:28-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:28):**  a decrepit piece of land and business?  
**[0:48:31-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:31):**  We need to be the rock stars in our communities.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:33):**  We need to be the ones that are like elevated because we're providing the food security.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:41):**  And I don't mean that in any ridiculous way.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:42):**  I just mean like we need to, you know, farming, as Patrick said, it's got one of the highest  
**[0:48:47-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:47):**  suicide rates of any profession on the planet.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:49):**  It used to be the most noble profession of all.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:53):**  And so I'm very interested in, well, how do you restore that?  
**[0:48:56-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:56):**  And it comes to these three legs.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:48:58):**  It's got to be regenerating land.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:01):**  It's got to be good for the customers and providing something better than they can find  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:07):**  in any shop or restaurant.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:08):**  And it's got to be financially good for me.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:11):**  I need a white collar salary because I'm working probably harder than they are.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:18):**  And I'm focused on that.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:19):**  And I'm just thinking about, well, look, the enterprises I've demonstrated in our cultural  
**[0:49:28-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:28):**  and economic climate are things that average between 50 and 200 thousand euros a hectare.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:35):**  So what about this for an idea for land access?  
**[0:49:38-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:38):**  Why don't we take, you know, in England where I grew up, there used to be there was a paper  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:45):**  put together by allotments.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:47):**  So everyone know an allotment like a small family space to garden your vegetables, right?  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:49:55):**  And all the allotments in the UK got filled up and then people died and there was no one  
**[0:50:00-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:00):**  helping manage them.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:01):**  So then it would take years to get that space freed up for someone else.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:05):**  So some people put I can't remember the name for people to look this up, but some people  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:09):**  work together to put together a paper that you could take to a farmer to get a lease  
**[0:50:15-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:15):**  on their land.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:17):**  And it provided all the legal and financial basis for this.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:21):**  So you could, you know, a group of 10 of you could go to a farm and give them a better  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:25):**  price than they would get for the crops they're growing to have access securely to a piece  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:29):**  of land.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:30):**  And I think this is an interesting idea.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:32):**  It's like the current average per hectare of European farmers is appalling.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:39):**  Like it's not even business.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:41):**  You know, they're basically losing money and getting it through subsidies.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:46):**  That's not business.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:47):**  That's shitty business.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:49):**  Right.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:50):**  So what I would like to see is more innovative land access schemes based around entrepreneurship  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:50:56):**  and business, not funding young people to farm, because if you haven't got that hustle  
**[0:51:01-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:01):**  and you don't put that work in, you're not going to have that same drive that I see in  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:07):**  the colleagues of ours that are successful.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:10):**  It's like we all started with nothing and we hustled.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:13):**  And that's a big part of the psychology of success, I think.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:17):**  So there's something important in there.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:19):**  And I think that that's how I would like to see land transition away from bigger land  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:26):**  holders.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:27):**  It's like the way to go circling back to your question is like how to influence them.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:34):**  Well, through my lifestyle and through the way I live.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:37):**  That's the way to influence them.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:39):**  Talking doesn't do anything.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:40):**  Not interested in it.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:42):**  It's like when they can see the best food.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:44):**  I eat a whole human diet for my farm and I have plenty of downtime.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:49):**  I have a beautiful family life with my kids around me all day.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:53):**  When they can see tangible things that are beneficial to them, that's when they start  
**[0:51:57-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:57):**  asking questions.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:51:59):**  And there's no discussion before then.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:01):**  But at the same time, to influence that further, what about innovative land access schemes  
**[0:52:06-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:06):**  where I can, where someone who has a better brain for legalities and legalese could put  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:12):**  together country specific forms where I can go to a farmer and guarantee them a better  
**[0:52:18-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:18):**  rate?  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:19):**  Because the enterprises are proven, they're given, they're all over Europe.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:24):**  We know how to farm these things.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:26):**  We know how to set up markets.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:28):**  I mean, I'm in as rural a market as you could get.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:31):**  So it's replicable all over the place.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:34):**  Obviously it's dependent on particular nuances to culture and time, place and circumstance.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:39):**  But anyone with half a wit about them can work that out.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:43):**  And I think that we could be taking over underutilized farmland and resource bases.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:51):**  And that's a way that we could put more land into innovative farming and at the same time  
**[0:52:57-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:52:57):**  rub off more directly and influence our direct spheres, which is ultimately the only people  
**[0:53:03-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:03):**  we can really interact with on that intimate level.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:07):**  I don't know if I was very clear in that point, but that's something I'd like to explore more.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:12):**  Indeed.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:13):**  Unfortunately, we just have limited time.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:15):**  There's so many things I would love to explore with all of you here and even be able to open  
**[0:53:19-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:19):**  it up more to the guests.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:20):**  But as we're starting to run down on time, perhaps we could talk a little about what  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:26):**  those of us who are not actively managing land or farming can do to help in this transition,  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:33):**  especially from the perspective of those of you who are in farming and Patrick, who has  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:37):**  a better idea of things at the governmental level, the European Union, perhaps starting  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:43):**  with Patrick.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:48):**  You know that there was for centuries, people were distrustful of democracy because they  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:54):**  confused it with mob rule.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:53:57):**  And they idealized something that was first formulated by Plato, the Greek philosopher,  
**[0:54:02-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:02):**  as a rule by experts.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:04):**  We actually have something like that happening in Europe right now.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:08):**  These experts are people sitting in the European Commission.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:11):**  When I interact with people in the director generals for agriculture, for environment,  
**[0:54:15-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:15):**  for climate, for research, by and large, I am dealing with extremely well educated, extremely  
**[0:54:21-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:21):**  clever multilingual people who do not have a personal interest in pushing A or B, but  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:27):**  who are generally interested in trying to find the right way forward.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:32):**  It's between that and reality that the sausage factory sits, Churchill's sausage factory,  
**[0:54:39-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:39):**  and that politics intervenes.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:40):**  And you have a classical example happening right now, where the European Commission put  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:44):**  some decent proposals on the table called the European Green Deal, the biodiversity  
**[0:54:48-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:48):**  strategy, the farm to fork strategy, and the politicians in the European Parliament and  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:53):**  the member states just immediately routed all that right back to ensure that the status  
**[0:54:58-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:54:58):**  quo, business as usual, input intensive agriculture would not be threatened.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:02):**  So how do you help the experts prevail over the politicians is in effect a question you're  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:09):**  asking me here.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:10):**  And there's two ways you can do that.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:11):**  The very first is to ensure that Richard's main argument becomes very widely socialized.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:18):**  This is not about making farmers poorer, it is about making farmers richer.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:22):**  It is about giving them a better lifestyle.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:25):**  It is about giving them more income, more resilience, better security, including financial  
**[0:55:30-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:30):**  security.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:31):**  That is absolutely fundamental and that message has to be pumped out time and time again.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:36):**  The second thing is that all of us as eaters, as simple consumers, have to take the time  
**[0:55:42-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:42):**  every week, be it only for 10 or 15 minutes, to sign the bloody petitions, to write letters  
**[0:55:48-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:48):**  to MPs and our MEPs, to make sure that the politicians understand that there is a large  
**[0:55:54-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:54):**  number of people out there who feel passionately enough about this that they are willing to  
**[0:55:58-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:55:58):**  spend some time interacting about it, even if it is not something that affects their  
**[0:56:03-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:03):**  direct livelihoods because they are not farmers themselves.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:07):**  Those two things would provide a countervailing force to the arguments for the status quonus  
**[0:56:14-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:14):**  of things.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:15):**  And those two things can work.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:17):**  For example, you find that in Europe, landowners are a very powerful group, both the new corporate  
**[0:56:25-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:25):**  landowners and also the old aristocratic landowners that control most of the land on this continent.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:32):**  Now what is interesting about this group is that they tend to have longer timeframes,  
**[0:56:36-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:36):**  longer time horizons, than people who are merely operating in the financial economy.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:42):**  They are not just interesting in what is happening next quarter, they are interesting in what  
**[0:56:46-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:46):**  is happening 10 years down the road.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:47):**  In the case of family-run businesses, they are interested in leaving good land and good  
**[0:56:51-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:51):**  condition to their children and grandchildren.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:54):**  And that is the third axis on which we can work.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:56:59):**  We can work with landowners to get them to understand that farming regeneratively is  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:05):**  about protecting their capital base, not only to ensure their own income today, but also  
**[0:57:10-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:10):**  to ensure the income of their children and grandchildren far into the future.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:14):**  So three things.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:15):**  First, emphasize time and time again that regenerative agriculture is a way of making  
**[0:57:20-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:20):**  farmers more comfortable, better off, more resilient, richer.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:23):**  It doesn't matter how you describe it, as long as the idea is you are better off than  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:26):**  being a conventional farmer.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:28):**  Second, ensure that the politicians understand that this is important and do it through the  
**[0:57:33-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:33):**  usual tools that the modern digital economy allows us, the petitions, the emails, the  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:40):**  sharing stuffs on Instagram, on Snapchat and Facebook and what have you.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:45):**  And third, I've forgotten what the third was.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:48):**  There you go.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:49):**  I'm forgetting my own summary.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:50):**  Oh, God, I hate being 55 years old.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:52):**  Your memory goes.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:53):**  Don't worry, we can hand it back to you if you remember in a minute.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:57:59):**  Benedict, would you like to say a few words on the topic?  
**[0:58:01-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:01):**  Yeah, I think Patrick summed it up beautifully.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:06):**  I think the only thing that I would maybe add is, you know, showing a general interest  
**[0:58:14-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:14):**  in the topic and basically being more critical also with regards to many of the things that  
**[0:58:23-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:23):**  we today get from media.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:25):**  If I think about, let's say, the whole vegan movement, for example, which I'm very aware  
**[0:58:33-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:33):**  that we of course have to cut down on the consumption of meat and especially with regards  
**[0:58:37-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:37):**  to where that meat comes from.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:39):**  But we live in a really complex and difficult ecosystem or thousands of ecosystems in that  
**[0:58:45-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:45):**  case.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:46):**  But we have to be more aware of, you know, there is no right and wrong answer in many  
**[0:58:51-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:51):**  of those situations.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:53):**  And, you know, having actually an opinion, I think you should also start looking into  
**[0:58:59-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:58:59):**  those kind of things and not just follow the hype, so to say.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:04):**  So I think there's a lot on the side of actually getting involved and actually informing yourself  
**[0:59:12-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:12):**  in a sense.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:13):**  And I think another aspect is bringing that knowledge base, but also the inspiration of  
**[0:59:25-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:25):**  what is out there with regards to different agroforestry methods, the centropic agricultural  
**[0:59:30-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:30):**  grazing, all of it, market gardening, of course, to the universities, for example, through  
**[0:59:36-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:36):**  having people do internships at your place, by having people involved that not usually  
**[0:59:42-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:42):**  have that much strong contact to the farming sector, to the farming world, by inviting  
**[0:59:47-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:47):**  them over for any kind of events and letting them partake in those processes.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:52):**  And then they bring that knowledge and not the knowledge necessarily, but they bring  
**[0:59:57-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=0:59:57):**  that interest into the universities and suddenly that you have in the university from the bottom  
**[1:00:02-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:02):**  up, so to say, you have a drive towards those kind of topics, which beforehand weren't that  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:07):**  interesting, right?  
**[1:00:08-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:08):**  So I think there's a lot about the whole sort of using technology and information in the  
**[1:00:13-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:13):**  sense of spreading the word, but at the same time trying to inform you as well as you can.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:20):**  And Richard, do you have anything you'd like to add for active steps that listeners can  
**[1:00:24-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:24):**  take from their part to help to move this forward?  
**[1:00:28-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:28):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:29):**  And I think that, like obviously the way people consume is very important.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:36):**  Social media today has massive impact and people all have access and influence on that.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:43):**  And I want to say actually that this stuff is already way more mainstream than people  
**[1:00:50-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:50):**  perhaps realize.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:53):**  And I want to say, as I mentioned before, like I don't hold faith in institutions leading  
**[1:00:58-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:00:58):**  the way in this because historically they never have.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:01):**  And that's certainly in the last 400 years of history that I can, you know, by my estimation,  
**[1:01:08-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:08):**  and I figure that, you know, it's public opinion that drives institutions.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:13):**  And when you look at Netflix, when you listen to podcasts like Joe Rogan or some of the  
**[1:01:18-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:18):**  biggest influential channels on the planet, regenerative agriculture is mentioned weekly.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:23):**  Like this is happening.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:25):**  It's already going mainstream.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:26):**  And so I just think that the more people make noise about that, that's what will drive our  
**[1:01:32-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:32):**  institutions.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:33):**  Not a few people sitting somewhere remotely from this.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:36):**  That's not where the change is going to come from.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:39):**  So thanks again to the three panelists, Richard, Patrick and Benedict, who are all working  
**[1:01:44-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:44):**  tirelessly to create a healthier and more equitable food system in Europe and around  
**[1:01:48-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:48):**  the world.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:49):**  And a special thanks to the team at Climate Farmers for organizing the event and to all  
**[1:01:54-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:54):**  the incredible people who showed up and supported the launch.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:01:57):**  Now as great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that  
**[1:02:01-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:01):**  we covered in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and  
**[1:02:06-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:06):**  viewpoints that are out there.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:08):**  And that's why I'm inviting you to join the growing community building regenerative skills  
**[1:02:12-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:12):**  to use in your daily lives.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:14):**  Now it'll always be free to join.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:16):**  All you have to do is follow the links on the homepage of the regenerative skills website.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:20):**  And the benefit of joining through the Discord channel is that unlike social media platforms  
**[1:02:24-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:24):**  that mine your personal data and manipulate your feeds based on algorithms just to sell  
**[1:02:29-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:29):**  you more junk, I founded these channels purely for knowledge, skill and story exchange between  
**[1:02:35-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:35):**  the people who care to make their worlds better for everyone.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:39):**  This week's question is, what do you envision as a regenerative food future for the world?  
**[1:02:44-1:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:44):**  How will we steward our food sheds, distribute the yields equitably, manage waste or surplus,  
**[1:02:51-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:51):**  and return health and nutrients to the land?  
**[1:02:54-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:54):**  There are so many ways to approach this vision and I can't wait to hear about yours.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:02:58):**  And don't forget, you can also help to guide the panel discussions that I've got planned  
**[1:03:01-1:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:03:01):**  for the future.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:03:03):**  So there it is, that's our show for this week.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-future-of-regenerative-agriculture-expert-panel/#t=1:03:05):**  Until the next episode, I'll catch you on the forums.

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright, now today's episode is very important in that there's a limited window of time  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:21):**  for those of you, especially in the USA, who care about natural building and want to see  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:26):**  COB and other natural building materials legalized and approved by building authorities to help  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:32):**  this to happen.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:33):**  An incredible opportunity is coming up in the last week of October, which is just over  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:37):**  a week from now, when members of the COB Research Institute, some of whom you'll hear interviewed  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:42):**  in a minute, will present a proposal for COB to be included in the ICC IRC Code.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:48):**  Now that's the International Code Council International Residential Code, the governing  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:53):**  body for building standards across the whole country.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:57):**  So to gain approval, the proposal will need to be voted on, and this is where you come  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:01):**  in.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:02):**  This is your chance to call your local fire marshal or building inspector and voice your  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:06):**  support that they vote to approve this measure, which would allow legal, permitted COB buildings  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:11):**  in the USA.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:13):**  Now you might be new to natural building, or you might think that you'd never want  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:17):**  a COB house yourself, but if this proposal passes, it's likely to have a ripple effect  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:23):**  for the approval of other earthen building materials and alternative building methods  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:27):**  in the future for everyone.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:29):**  The guys from the CRI will give more details about how you can help to support this initiative,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:34):**  but if this is all you have time to listen to, just know that you can go to COBCODE.ORG  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:39):**  and get specific instructions on how to contact your local building official directly, or  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:44):**  to put them in contact with the CRI to help get out the vote on this potentially historic  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:48):**  advancement for earthen and natural building.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:52):**  So don't hesitate, like I mentioned, the vote will take place during the last week  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:55):**  of October, this month, 2019.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:59):**  So in this interview I got to speak with John Fordyce, Martin Hammer, and Anthony Dente,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:04):**  who have been working for years to compile the data and engineering properties of COB  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:09):**  in order to better understand the material and write the proposal to have it approved  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:13):**  as a legal building material in the US.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:17):**  Between them they answered a lot of questions about the advantages and limitations of COB,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:21):**  the tests and simulations they've done to get proper measurements of its performance,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:26):**  and what they recommend to builders who are considering using COB to build their homes.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:30):**  It was such a pleasure for a natural building nerd like me to get to talk to these guys  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:35):**  who've worked so hard to get verifiable information on the material that got me to  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:39):**  fall in love with earthen building in the first place.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:42):**  So from here I'll hand it over to the team from the COB Research Institute.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:48):**  Gentlemen thank you all for being with me today.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:50):**  It's such a pleasure to have three of you representing the COB Research Institute all  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:54):**  at once.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:55):**  We've got a lot of material to get through today as there's an important date approaching.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:01):**  So before we jump into the questions, why don't we give a quick introduction to everybody  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:06):**  sitting with us here and a little bit about your background and your position with the  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:10):**  COB Research Institute, starting with John Fordyce.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:14):**  Yes.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:15):**  Hi, Oliver.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:17):**  This is John Fordyce and I'm basically the director of the COB Research Institute.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:25):**  My history is I'm an architect and experienced cobbler and those two professional things  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:35):**  led me to the creation of the COB Research Institute.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:41):**  Marvelous Martin, why don't you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:44):**  background.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:45):**  Thanks, Oliver.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:46):**  I'm an architect with the private practice in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 30  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:53):**  years.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:54):**  And I've been involved in sustainable construction for my entire career, with an emphasis on  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:02):**  straw bale construction.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:03):**  And that got me into code development about 20, almost 20 years ago now.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:10):**  So I've been lead author or co-author of a number of appendices in national model building  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:21):**  codes, including this most recent proposal on cob construction.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:26):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:27):**  Thank you, Martin.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:28):**  And I'm an advisor to the COB Research Institute, specifically around the code development.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:35):**  Great.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:36):**  And Anthony, tell us a little bit about yourself and your background.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:40):**  Hello, my name is Anthony Dente.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:41):**  I'm a licensed civil engineer in the state of California.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:44):**  I'm a principal and owner of urgent structural engineers and I'm a board member on the COB  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:50):**  Research Institute and the lead engineer for the organization.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:53):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:54):**  Well, gentlemen, thank you all for taking the time to be with me today.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:58):**  And we're here gathered kind of for a specific purpose this time around.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:03):**  There's an important date approaching, as I mentioned earlier, and there are some proposed  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:08):**  changes to the COB code that could go into effect based on the activity and the votes  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:15):**  of people in the area of California.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:17):**  And before we get into more detail about this important date and what listeners can do to  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:22):**  help make this happen, let's start with the very beginning and get people sort of comfortable  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:29):**  with this material that we're talking about so that they understand what the importance  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:34):**  is to begin with.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:36):**  So let's start by asking, what is COB?  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:39):**  I've written articles about this myself, which are posted on the website, but straight from  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:44):**  the people who have worked with it as a building material and its engineering properties.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:51):**  John, could you start by telling us what is COB?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:54):**  What can it be done for buildings and sort of what advantages it has over other more  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:59):**  conventional building materials?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:01):**  Sure, Oliver.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:04):**  Basically COB is a mixture of earth, sand, and straw with water, which is used to create  
**[0:07:12-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:12):**  a plastic earth and mixture that is then used to build walls.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:20):**  And the advantages of that is that it's a highly sustainable way of building and it  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:29):**  uses locally sourced materials.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:35):**  The mixture is like Adobe, but we don't make bricks.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:39):**  We just stack it up in layers on top of a foundation and a stem wall to create the walls.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:52):**  The layers are interpenetrated so that we actually achieve a monolithic construction  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:03):**  rather than mortar bricks like Adobe.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:07):**  And it's just done as a sequence of stacking up the layers, letting them dry, and then  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:11):**  adding more layers as the building progresses in height.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:15):**  And as I mentioned, the wall is protected from ground moisture by a stem wall and a  
**[0:08:21-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:21):**  foundation and those are either concrete or stone, mortared stone or broken concrete urbanite.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:32):**  And then in the construction of the wall, originally it did not include reinforcing  
**[0:08:41-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:41):**  that was provided by the straw, but now for what we've been doing, we've actually included  
**[0:08:49-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:49):**  actual reinforcing in the wall because it's needed for seismic strength.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:57):**  And the rest of the building is basically standard construction that is in the roof  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:03):**  as wood and all the other elements are basically standard.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:08):**  And the advantages of Cobb is that it's low cost, low material cost, got a low carbon  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:15):**  footprint.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:17):**  The technique is very simple and it's really friendly to owner builders and that can remove  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:25):**  with owner builder, remove the labor costs, which can be as much as two thirds of the  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:30):**  cost of a building.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:33):**  And the beauty of it is that it allows non-rectilinear designs.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:40):**  And for me personally, this is a cure to what I call Cartesian madness where we live in  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:51):**  a world that is basically dominated by rectilinear construction and that affects our thinking  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:58):**  and cultural habits and so Cobb makes possible a change from that.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:05):**  So those are the advantages.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:08):**  Could you also tell us a brief history about how this became used as a building material  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:13):**  and especially in the western United States where its implementation is fairly recent?  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:21):**  Well, the earliest evidence of Cobb is lost in antiquity because it erodes.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:28):**  And so the most recent archeological evidence is the 11th century in Africa.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:38):**  And then we know that it's been used in Europe since about the 12th century and there are  
**[0:10:44-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:44):**  many forms in Europe, the Middle East and Asia and that by the 15th century, it was  
**[0:10:53-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:53):**  a normal part of construction in the UK, United Kingdom, England and then it was widely used  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:06):**  by the 19th century.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:10):**  The use of Cobb declined with the 1800s industrial and transportation revolution and then with  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:20):**  the development of building codes in the 1800s, Cobb was not included and so its use became  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:26):**  prevented.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:28):**  And the traditions then for construction died out.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:34):**  Then there's been a resurgence of it in the 1900s in the United Kingdom and in about the  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:42):**  1990s, an organization called the Cobb Cottage Company brought Cobb to North America and  
**[0:11:48-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:48):**  they developed the early Oregon Cobb techniques and which is the basis of what we're using  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:59):**  in the code.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:02):**  And I guess that aside from the development of the Cobb Oregon techniques, Cobb got spread  
**[0:12:11-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:11):**  in North America by Cobb Cottage Company workshops and it gained popularity due to low cost and  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:20):**  owner builder appeal.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:23):**  But because there is no code for Cobb in North America or the United States, it resulted  
**[0:12:30-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:30):**  in outlaw building and that's where we are now.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:38):**  We're attempting to solve this by creating a Cobb code to make it possible for Cobb to  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:44):**  be built legally where otherwise it stopped.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:47):**  Yeah, it's remarkable for me to hear the history of this building material kind of summed up  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:53):**  because especially the last part of what you were talking about, about how the Cobb Cottage  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:57):**  Company sort of revived a version of this building material recently is pretty close  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:03):**  to my own experience since that's the company and those are the people who I apprenticed  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:08):**  with to start learning natural building myself and have since taken it to a lot of other  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:12):**  places around the world.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:14):**  You know, though it seems like such an ideal building material for many different applications,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:20):**  it's like you said, still not legal to build this way within the United States.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:25):**  Martin, could you talk a little bit about the current state of Cobb in the United States  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:30):**  and sort of how it's regarded or classified in the building world?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:34):**  Thanks Oliver.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:36):**  Well as John and you just described, when Cobb as a material and building system was  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:45):**  brought to the US, it came from primarily the area of the UK and other parts of Europe  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:53):**  that are not subject to earthquakes.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:57):**  So that transition created some problems because those centuries of use and the building systems  
**[0:14:11-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:11):**  developed there didn't have to, weren't confronted with these what are called lateral loads,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:20):**  lateral forces that are imposed on buildings from earthquakes.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:26):**  And the material and system when it came to North America was primarily used in some of  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:32):**  the western states, especially Oregon and parts of Northern California.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:38):**  So that was terrific that this really wonderful material and system migrated to the west coast  
**[0:14:48-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:48):**  of the United States, but there were some inadvertent consequences of that, which is  
**[0:14:56-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:56):**  there was incomplete or very well an absence of understanding of how this material and  
**[0:15:05-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:05):**  this building system performs when subject to moderate to high earthquake loads.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:14):**  Building in what we believe are some unsafe buildings in the western United States.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:24):**  We don't know the extent of that right now because there haven't been very few moderate  
**[0:15:34-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:34):**  or high magnitude earthquakes in these buildings that have been subjected to.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:44):**  So what we're going to find out eventually, because in the western states we know that  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:57):**  high magnitude earthquakes will occur eventually.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:01):**  But we in testing, there's a lot of the Cobb Research Institute has facilitated testing  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:12):**  for this exact purpose to understand the capacity of Cobb wall systems with different types  
**[0:16:17-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:17):**  of reinforcing, including no steel reinforcing, just using the straw itself as the reinforcing  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:26):**  in the wall, but also with steel reinforcing and Anthony Dentis will talk a little bit  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:31):**  more about this later.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:33):**  But as John mentioned, because there is no Cobb code, not only in the west coast of the  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:42):**  US, but anywhere in the United States, one of a few things happen.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:48):**  People when they find out about that and the difficulty, not impossibility because there  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:54):**  have been some permitted buildings, permitted Cobb buildings, just a few, and Anthony has  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:59):**  been involved in those.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:02):**  But when they find out the difficulty and at the time and cost involved in getting a  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:09):**  permitted Cobb building constructed, they do one of a couple of things.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:16):**  They don't build with Cobb or as John mentioned, they'll build an unpermitted building that  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:25):**  could be unsafe because there's no inspection process or plan review.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:32):**  And then sometimes if buildings are built without a permit, that building is discovered  
**[0:17:39-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:39):**  later on by a building official or a neighbor and that causes a huge problem for the building  
**[0:17:48-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:48):**  owner because in one case in particular, in the San Francisco area where an unpermitted  
**[0:17:56-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:56):**  Cobb building was discovered and that owner had to go through very challenging process  
**[0:18:04-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:04):**  of having the building made seismically safe as a retrofit.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:12):**  So that's for all those reasons, having a Cobb code is very important for anyone who's  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:22):**  interested in building with this earthen building system.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:30):**  And I also want to mention one other, earlier John was talking about, you asked and John  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:37):**  was talking about the advantages of Cobb.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:40):**  One important advantage that he didn't mention is that Cobb as an earthen building system  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:46):**  is highly fire resistant.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:49):**  It's been used for centuries in kilns and ovens.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:54):**  That's a testament to how well it performs in fire.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:00):**  It contains fire in kilns and ovens.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:04):**  And that's especially important in western states in the U.S. that have been subject  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:12):**  to increased intensity and frequency of wildfires.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:16):**  So rather than building with wood frame, which is the predominant residential method of construction  
**[0:19:23-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:23):**  in the U.S., especially after a wildfire, some which have decimated entire cities in  
**[0:19:35-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:35):**  California in particular, that rather than build with wood again, a highly combustible  
**[0:19:44-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:44):**  material and system using an earthen system like Cobb makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:53):**  So along those lines, I know you mentioned that people would either be deterred from  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:57):**  building with Cobb at all, or perhaps just build unpermitted structures.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:03):**  And I'm wondering if, since so many people have gone ahead and built without permits,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:08):**  I've been involved in some of those projects myself during my education and workshops along  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:12):**  this.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:13):**  And it seems like there's sort of a counterculture that tends to use this material at the moment  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:20):**  and may not want to have this come into government hands where there would be tight regulations  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:27):**  and dictations about how they can or cannot continue to construct with earthen materials.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:34):**  What would be the incentive for those people who are kind of on the fringes of what's allowed  
**[0:20:39-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:39):**  by building already to get involved with perhaps a more oversight of their projects?  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:49):**  That's a good question, Oliver.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:51):**  And there are pros and cons, one could say, about a building system or material being  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:58):**  governed by building codes.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:00):**  But in my experience, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages of having a code-approved  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:10):**  building system.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:12):**  For one, in code development, the codes are vetted through a process, through an open  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:21):**  process, and there's input from many knowledgeable design and building professionals.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:28):**  So it ensures that safe construction will occur.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:33):**  So I mentioned that earlier that we know of or are fairly sure there are a number of what  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:41):**  we would consider unsafe buildings that have been built and have dotted the landscape.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:47):**  So that's one important advantage.  
**[0:21:52-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:52):**  There are others, well, people, if you're building a structure to know that it's unpermitted  
**[0:22:00-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:00):**  and maybe if you want to use the term illegal, but let's say at least unpermitted, just the  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:12):**  anxiety that that may cause an owner, that the building may be discovered and have to  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:18):**  be torn down.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:19):**  There are buildings that have been discovered and were required, forced to be removed.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:25):**  So just removing that anxiety from a homeowner.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:30):**  But there are other important issues too, like insurance or potentially if a home loan  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:45):**  was required.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:47):**  So the lending industry and the insurance industry are very averse to the construction  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:56):**  of non-permitted and non-code approved buildings.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:59):**  Anthony, do you have something you'd like to add to that?  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:03):**  Yeah, I have a lot of experience of performing structural observations and assessments of  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:09):**  existing structures, non-permitted cob structures.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:12):**  And there's two points that I think are important to the question you asked.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:18):**  One is that it's easy to look at the building codes as a quote unquote bad guy or a bureaucratic  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:26):**  system trying to rain down and tamp good ideas.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:32):**  Though there are, as Martin said, a lot of benefits to the building code and oversight  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:41):**  on all aspects of construction is one of them.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:44):**  One thing I find the most is that these unpermitted cob buildings are often built by high quality  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:50):**  cob practitioners in many cases.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:54):**  Though because the craft of these builders tends to be cob, they aren't as educated in  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:02):**  foundation, roof connection, roof diaphragm, which is the earthquake system that helps  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:08):**  connect the top of the building together.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:14):**  Building these aspects of the building can be quite simple and not that expensive.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:21):**  But when you're not kind of forced to look at the literature on those topics, you can  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:30):**  easily miss one step or two steps.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:32):**  And in structural engineering, we talk constantly about load path.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:36):**  And when one link in the chain of load path is disconnected, that load's not going to  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:40):**  make it down to the ground where you want it to rest.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:43):**  And I think the other important point to your question is that just because there may be  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:48):**  a building code for a material, it doesn't mean that people who maybe would have gotten  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:54):**  away with building without a permit before can't still attempt to take that route.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:00):**  It's illegal in most places around where I practice, but people still build illegal or  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:09):**  unpermitted wood structures or other materials.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:13):**  So this wouldn't stop people from doing that.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:16):**  It would just make a widely open the door for those who are prohibited from building,  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:24):**  whether it's insurance or whether it's legality or just concern for safety.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:30):**  And I would imagine too that having COB just as a general building material, not having  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:36):**  a way to or a path towards legalization or permitting is probably holding it back quite  
**[0:25:42-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:42):**  a bit from innovation and continuing to improve because much like medical marijuana was a  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:50):**  handful of years ago, for a lack of access, not only for use, but also for study, is going  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:57):**  to hold it back from advancing along with the rest of the technologies that we use for  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:02):**  building.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:03):**  And as a couple of you have mentioned already, the applications are extremely relevant to  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:08):**  the context, especially where you guys are in California with seismic issues, with forest  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:15):**  fire issues.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:16):**  And the fact that this could potentially perform much better than what is already on the books  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:21):**  means that there's a lot of potential for where this could go if legalized.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:27):**  Now along those lines, let's switch gears for just a second and talk about how the COB  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:33):**  Research Institute comes in and the type of work that you have done collectively, because  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:38):**  I know there's a larger team behind this as well, in order to try and study this material  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:43):**  in order to get the engineering specs and the information needed to bring it to the  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:49):**  coding and permitting bodies.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:50):**  John do you want to take it from here?  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:53):**  That's a big question.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:58):**  Basically what we've been able to accomplish so far, once we learned to function as an  
**[0:27:03-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:03):**  organization, we have been conducting tests.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:12):**  We did tests with the Santa Clara University, with Quail Springs in permaculture, and that  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:22):**  was Anthony doing out of plane testing.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:26):**  And then we did some thermal testing to establish the R-value.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:30):**  So all of these tests have given us enough information to begin to write the code, and  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:40):**  once we get the code accepted, then we will have accomplished a great deal of what we  
**[0:27:45-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:45):**  need to do, but we won't be stopping there because one of the things that we've discovered  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:53):**  in the process of writing the code is that there's a lot of information that we still  
**[0:27:58-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:58):**  don't know, and so there's going to be additional research that is needed.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:07):**  So we're part way there, but we have a long ways to go still.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:13):**  So like you said, this is a much larger topic because so many different tests and analysis  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:19):**  need to be done on this material, and many of which are still to come.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:24):**  Tell me a little bit about the necessities of the material to be accepted, starting with  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:29):**  the structural necessity, how it can bear weight.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:34):**  How have you been able to test the structural stability of COP?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:40):**  We've had the opportunity to work with a number of different universities, and there's also  
**[0:28:46-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:46):**  testing bodies and university members, graduate students beyond CRI that are doing and have  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:55):**  done quality testing, though the total volume is still quite low.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:59):**  It's not a proprietary product or it's quite difficult to make into a proprietary product,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:04):**  so the funding for research is low, and therefore there is a small amount of it because of that.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:12):**  And though we've had a great opportunity to work with the University of San Francisco,  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:19):**  the University of Santa Clara, Cal Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo, California,  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:25):**  and we've conducted both small-scale batch tests and also full-scale in-plane, out-of-plane  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:33):**  loading tests.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:36):**  To answer your question specifically about gravity loads, this is the material's strongest  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:42):**  suit.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:43):**  It's a compression-based material quite akin to concrete, and its strength is in compression  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:50):**  and there is a reinforcement mechanism added to it to increase its tensile strength to  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:56):**  allow it to bend and move in other ways.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:00):**  Though we find consistently that it's almost difficult to reach – slenderness is an issue,  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:10):**  and we could get quite involved in talking about the slenderness limitations of COB,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:17):**  though right now, the way the research stands, we strongly recommend four-foot wall sections  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:25):**  and minimum thickness based on height, which is contained in the code, though if – once  
**[0:30:33-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:33):**  you're – those recommendations are not just involved with compression loading.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:41):**  There's lateral loading consideration in those recommendations as well.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:45):**  And it's normally when you're considering all the actions of the building, compression  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:50):**  is not where the material is tending to fail.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:54):**  It's because it's compression-based, it's bending capabilities that are limiting it  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:58):**  – limiting its function.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:02):**  So what is that addition that is being put in the walls to increase the tensile strength  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:06):**  of the material?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:08):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:11):**  Marty spoke to this, and so did John a little bit earlier, but the natural form of the material,  
**[0:31:17-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:17):**  the base form of the material, uses straw as a biofiber micro-reinforcing system, and  
**[0:31:24-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:24):**  the concrete – codified concrete construction has a microfiber reinforcing option.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:33):**  They typically use metal microfibers.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:38):**  Here we're obviously using a agricultural product as the microfiber, but as we all know,  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:45):**  straw has tensile capability, and as some of us know but others may not know, clay is  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:50):**  a magical material that wicks water away from most other things it's in contact with.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:55):**  So we've had the privilege of being present when 100-plus-year-old cob buildings have  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:02):**  been opened up for various reasons, and you see the straw looks like it was picked the  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:06):**  day prior.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:08):**  It keeps its material integrity, and so that tensile micro-reinforcing capacity that it's  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:14):**  offering stays present throughout the building's life because of that function.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:19):**  That being said, we have found, especially in high-seismic zones, that a stronger reinforcing  
**[0:32:25-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:25):**  system is required in most locations that we design in on the western states, and so  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:35):**  other forms of reinforcing, steel reinforcing, we're finding that mesh reinforcing systems  
**[0:32:40-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:40):**  mimic the distribution matrix of the straw and the general low strength of the material.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:49):**  Cob is low strength, but the walls are large, so when we use steel meshes, they interact  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:56):**  the best, and whether that's horizontal or vertical mesh, depending on what your objective  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:00):**  is or what your primary problem is for the shape of your building and its location, we're  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:06):**  finding that you get a lot of bang for your buck when you make simple steps of adding  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:12):**  the right kind of reinforcing, non-straw steel or other forms of reinforcing.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:19):**  Like you said, this is probably key in areas with bigger seismic loads or the danger of  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:24):**  really hard shearing winds.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:26):**  Let's talk about some of the other properties that have been noted as an advantage to cob  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:30):**  as well, specifically its inability to burn as a non-combustible material.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:35):**  Tell me where that comes in and how you've been able to measure that.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:39):**  So yes, as I mentioned earlier, and you also, Oliver, that is one of cob's strengths, it's  
**[0:33:48-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:48):**  high resistance to fire, and there have been tests in different parts of the world, some  
**[0:33:58-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:58):**  in Australia come to mind, on either cob or similar materials like adobe or other earthen  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:09):**  materials.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:12):**  So there's, well, and there's lots of anecdotal evidence.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:16):**  There was a, there have been many bushfires in central Australia over recent decades,  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:27):**  catastrophic fires, not unlike some of the ones that have been experienced in the western  
**[0:34:31-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:31):**  US recently, where all buildings have been destroyed, all wood buildings have been destroyed,  
**[0:34:40-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:40):**  but where a cob or more often an adobe structure, other earthen structure has been subjected  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:48):**  to the same fire, it's the only building or building element that is left standing.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:55):**  Everything else is incinerated.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:57):**  So we have anecdotal evidence such as the performance in actual fires and some testing,  
**[0:35:05-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:05):**  some done to rigorous testing standards, but there hasn't been a complete fire test for  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:19):**  a cob wall that any of us are aware of, we don't think it exists.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:26):**  And in the process of developing or going through the code development process, there  
**[0:35:35-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:35):**  are some, there are rigorous or explicit standards or testing standards that are required in  
**[0:35:43-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:43):**  order to assign, for example, what's known as a fire resistance rating.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:50):**  So there are different lengths of time, one hour, two hour, four hour, for example, where  
**[0:35:56-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:56):**  the assembly, the wall assembly passes a certain test.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:04):**  And so because that test hasn't been performed and that test, that type of test is quite  
**[0:36:12-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:12):**  expensive, in the code proposal that CRI recently submitted in the International Code Council  
**[0:36:21-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:21):**  process, we proposed a one hour fire resistance rating for a cob wall, which is very conservative  
**[0:36:35-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:35):**  to what we expect or know from other, from some of the partial testing, I'll call it.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:44):**  And that was, an analysis was performed by a fire science engineer and university professor.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:54):**  So we had it quite well analyzed and made what we thought was a reasonable proposal,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:02):**  but because of the strictness of the code requirements for the testing, that assigned  
**[0:37:17-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:17):**  fire resistance rating was either the primary or maybe even the sole reason that our code  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:27):**  proposal in May was recently disapproved.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:33):**  There's another code hearing coming up at the end of the month, which you alluded to  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:39):**  in the beginning of the program.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:42):**  And that's, so we've made revisions to the code proposal to remove that one hour fire  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:51):**  resistance rating.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:52):**  So it's, so we expect with that change, there's a good chance that the code proposal will  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:59):**  be approved.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:03):**  And even without that fire resistance rating, the COB code that's been considered is still  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:11):**  very useful because in most residential construction, there is no fire resistance rating required.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:17):**  It's only when a building is very close to the property line, for example.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:22):**  So it's still a very valid proposal, but it's also ironic that we, this revised proposal  
**[0:38:29-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:29):**  includes no fire resistance rating for a wall system that we know is highly fire resistant.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:37):**  And so, but that is something that we plan, that CRI plans to do in the near future to  
**[0:38:43-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:43):**  subject a cob wall to one of these ASTM is the testing body or underwriter's laboratory  
**[0:38:53-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:53):**  is another one that we could do, but subject it to a test, subject to us obtaining the  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:01):**  funding for it and find out exactly how fire resistant a cob wall is.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:07):**  But we're expecting a very high rating, probably at least a four hour rating, which is quite  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:13):**  high.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:14):**  And it's not, it wouldn't be surprising because it's a non combustible wall system, but it  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:25):**  is a part of the test is also it being subjected to a fire hose, but has to withstand that  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:31):**  impact.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:35):**  And that's why these tests are required because we all want to be sure that these building  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:42):**  systems are safe in these conditions.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:45):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:47):**  It's funny though, that the area in which it's likely to perform the best is the one  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:52):**  that has held it back.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:54):**  When there are other things that, you know, are a little bit more difficult to test.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:59):**  Like you said, these are all made of non combustible materials, so it should perform just fine.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:05):**  Now let's talk about one of the areas in which it gets a little bit more complicated.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:10):**  In the regions that we've been talking about the seismic danger, the fire danger are prevalent.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:15):**  But for example, where I grew up in Minnesota, it's much more of an issue of thermal or insulative  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:22):**  properties of the wall system.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:25):**  Now John, would you like to talk a little bit about how cob performs as a thermal structure?  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:32):**  Because it's not as simple as many people are familiar thinking about it as insulation.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:38):**  It works as a thermal mass and that comes with its own complications.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:42):**  Could you explain that a little?  
**[0:40:44-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:44):**  So thermal performance is a function of two things, mass and thermal resistance.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:53):**  So cob is terrific in terms of its mass.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:57):**  It's a high mass wall system.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:00):**  It's not very good in terms of thermal resistance for the same reason.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:05):**  It's a very dense material.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:06):**  It does have straw in it, which has good resistance actually.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:13):**  Straw bales walls, for example, are highly of great thermal resistance.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:20):**  But overall, the matrix is dominated by the mass and so it's challenging in terms of being  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:32):**  a good thermal resistant wall system.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:35):**  And it's challenged in meeting building code requirements, existing building code requirements  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:41):**  in virtually every state, especially in the colder climates.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:46):**  You mentioned Minnesota, where the mass is more important in hotter climates.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:54):**  It does have some value in colder climates as well, but it's thermal resistance that's  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:58):**  most important in the colder climates.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:00):**  So in the code proposal, the cob wall is designated as what's called a mass wall system and that's  
**[0:42:11-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:11):**  good because it thereby has lower thermal resistance requirements.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:19):**  But it's still challenging.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:22):**  Other mass wall systems have a similar challenge.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:27):**  Historic wall systems are concrete or concrete block.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:31):**  Even log homes are considered mass wall system.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:36):**  They all have the same challenge or other earthen wall systems like rammed earth or  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:42):**  Adobe or earth bag.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:46):**  So one solution is to add insulation to the exterior of the building.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:51):**  And even wood frame buildings, that's being done quite a bit recently to improve the thermal  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:56):**  resistance of a wood frame structure.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:59):**  And there are different ways to do that.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:01):**  And there are some materials that would be especially appropriate for a cob wall that  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:08):**  are more environmentally friendly.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:12):**  So there's rock wall insulation.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:17):**  Or there's some cellulose-based insulation.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:21):**  A new generation of insulation boards that are not petrochemical products.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:29):**  So there are possibilities.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:30):**  But that's something we're just getting into exploring.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:36):**  And that is allowed in the way the code proposal is written.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:41):**  That type of solution is allowed.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:45):**  Another possibility is to change the mix of the cob itself.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:52):**  So maybe more straw.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:55):**  Or to change the aggregate.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:56):**  So instead of sand, use other types of aggregates that have better insulating value like lava  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:03):**  rock or pumice or perlite.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:07):**  So John, maybe John, if you could speak to that a little bit.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:15):**  You've been working with that very recently.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:19):**  Yeah, well, I just started some samples to be used with various mixtures.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:27):**  The materials you just mentioned, lighter weight aggregates to basically lower the density  
**[0:44:39-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:39):**  of the cob and thereby improve the thermal resistance.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:47):**  And as is the case with the other tests such as thermal, this testing is pretty expensive.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:56):**  And so we're kind of on hold with it at the moment because we just don't have the funding  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:02):**  to pursue it.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:05):**  I know that there is in England, the University of Plymouth has been doing experiments with  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:15):**  a project called Cob Barge.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:20):**  Barge being the French word for cob and to increase thermal resistance of cob walls.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:30):**  And I'm looking forward to seeing what they're going to propose or will have come up with  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:39):**  their testing to see if there's any of that stuff that we can use in future work with  
**[0:45:46-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:46):**  the RCRI code work.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:54):**  We just have to wait and see at the moment.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:56):**  Fair enough.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:57):**  And I was actually wondering because you guys have done some great work and research along  
**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:00):**  these lines, but I've also seen some advancements from other organizations.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:04):**  I'm glad you brought up Cob Barge.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:07):**  I've seen a lot of the experiments that they've done in controlled environments, the data  
**[0:46:11-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:11):**  that they've been getting from there.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:13):**  I know that certain seismic tests were done on a small cob building up in Vancouver, Canada  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:19):**  a while ago.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:20):**  Do you get this kind of information from a wide variety of sources or do you try and  
**[0:46:25-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:25):**  just simulate some of these tests in house in order to comply to what is needed by these  
**[0:46:33-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:33):**  coding bodies?  
**[0:46:34-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:34):**  Yes, we do our best to cast as wide a net as possible when gathering information.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:41):**  Any testing that's been done worldwide on the material is valuable to us.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:47):**  We find because there's a lot of complications with testing this material.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:53):**  The samples appear to prefer to be slightly larger than concrete samples.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:59):**  The full-scale samples can be incredibly heavy.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:02):**  A seven by seven wall system can be between 5,000, 7,000 pounds.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:07):**  Moving that around in a university setting or a testing lab setting can be very difficult.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:13):**  Bringing quality practitioners to the site to build a material that only is lifted eight  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:18):**  inches per day can be quite difficult.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:21):**  I bring up these complications because most tests of the less than 20 major structural  
**[0:47:29-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:29):**  tests that we've collected, you mentioned the British Columbia tests that they ran.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:35):**  Unfortunately they never produced a report for that.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:38):**  In Sydney, Australia, they ran another shake table test, though unfortunately the shake  
**[0:47:44-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:44):**  table was not able to shake to the magnitude of failure.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:54):**  As we learn as a community, a global community about testing COB, we learn learning what  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:01):**  not to do is as important as getting values.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:05):**  There's a lot of that too.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:06):**  Though John, I don't know if he wants to speak to this, but conducted a very wide search  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:11):**  for information all across the globe in an attempt to write a white paper on the current  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:16):**  state of all research on all topics.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:19):**  That proved to be very, very helpful.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:22):**  That was over, I don't know, the past four or five years that went on.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:27):**  Yeah, that's an ongoing project.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:30):**  I have a whole list of papers that I still need to go through.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:37):**  As Anthony said, we did gain a lot of information from the original part of the COB technical  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:44):**  white paper research, but it is still ongoing.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:48):**  And so with all of this information as it's being presented to the permitting bodies,  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:54):**  what would change for people who have either built with COB in the past or learned it through  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:00):**  sort of informal methods, much like I have?  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:03):**  I know, Anthony, you had mentioned changes into what is recommended, things like perhaps  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:10):**  four foot wall sections.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:11):**  I couldn't understand if that was a thickness rating or if that was a general size that  
**[0:49:16-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:16):**  you had used for testing.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:18):**  How does this differ from perhaps what the prevailing knowledge around COB building currently  
**[0:49:24-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:24):**  is?  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:25):**  Yes, I'm happy to speak to that.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:27):**  The prevailing knowledge on COB building varies quite widely.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:34):**  In New Zealand, they have what we consider the most robust earthen building standards  
**[0:49:40-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:40):**  nationally recognized.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:41):**  They're also a seismically active country and English speaking, which is beneficial  
**[0:49:45-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:45):**  to us in the Western United States.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:49):**  There's also been an ASTM standard written on earthen wall construction, which mostly  
**[0:49:55-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:55):**  followed a lot of the same guidelines as the New Zealand code.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:59):**  And then there are many, many, some permitted but mostly unpermitted structures across the  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:07):**  Western United States and across the globe.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:13):**  Though I bring up all three of those because you will find every shape, size, format of  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:22):**  wall lineup, of wall sizing, of window spacing.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:27):**  Having very large window cavities with very thin columns of straw only COB is not advisable.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:40):**  This is something that you do see in practice and that is a detail that the code and people  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:50):**  with current knowledge of testing and of building standards with the material would highly recommend  
**[0:50:56-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:56):**  against in any environment, but especially in seismic environments and high wind environments.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:07):**  Foundations are another part of the structure that are often built not to current code standards.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:13):**  I believe there's a lot of potential for research on this topic of exploring ways to make moisture  
**[0:51:24-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:24):**  proof environmentally sustaining foundation isolating basis for COB structures.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:31):**  Though currently in the United States, the prevailing permittable foundation system is  
**[0:51:39-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:39):**  a concrete foundation system.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:41):**  We work closely with trying to intensely decrease carbon input into our concrete mixes here  
**[0:51:49-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:49):**  at our office.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:52):**  As you know, concrete can be quite carbon intensive.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:56):**  And there's a number of other little bells and whistles, connections to roof diaphragms.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:01):**  How are you anchoring to the top of your wall?  
**[0:52:04-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:04):**  How is that connected to your roof rafters?  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:07):**  Metal clips, just metal clips connecting those pieces together can add a continuity to the  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:13):**  building that keeps one side of the building far more securely attached to the other side  
**[0:52:19-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:19):**  of the building.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:20):**  And that can be really helpful, but not always done in practice.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:26):**  And Oliver, this is Martin.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:30):**  Very good description from Anthony.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:32):**  And I'm glad he mentioned the New Zealand standards for earthen construction, which  
**[0:52:37-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:37):**  have been really important in informing our proposed, CRI's proposed COB code.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:44):**  But there's another answer that I want to elaborate just a little bit.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:54):**  It was really important when we did the testing, the structural testing at Santa Clara University  
**[0:53:01-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:01):**  to include what we came to call the common practice wall.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:09):**  Essentially the wall that's most, the COB wall that's most commonly built or has been  
**[0:53:14-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:14):**  built over the last couple of decades, especially in the Western United States and in other  
**[0:53:21-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:21):**  parts of the country.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:25):**  So the reinforcing was straw only.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:28):**  Well, the foundation was, we simulated a stone, a stone, or a mortared stone foundation with  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:39):**  an irregular top to it.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:44):**  And then a straw only reinforcement.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:48):**  So a friction connection at the bottom where the COB wall meets the foundation.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:54):**  And then at the top of the wall, there were anchors into the bond beam that we felt that  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:01):**  that was necessary to get a fair result.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:05):**  So that wall was tested and it does have some capacity.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:09):**  It actually exceeded our expectations, but the capacity is still limited and would have  
**[0:54:17-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:17):**  very, would be very challenging to use that type of a wall in a high seismic zone.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:24):**  Or if it were used in a high seismic zone, you would need a long length of wall.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:30):**  So there's the capacity of the wall, its strength per foot, you can think of it that way.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:36):**  And then depending on the situation, you may need more or less length of that wall and  
**[0:54:41-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:41):**  then distribute it in a balanced manner in the building.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:48):**  But also, well, so that what we're calling this common practice wall would have fairly  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:55):**  high applicability in almost all of the United States, because most of the United States  
**[0:55:02-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:02):**  is a lower seismic, lower seismic risks, lower seismic risk.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:09):**  So we, what's called their categories A through E essentially, with A and B being the lowest  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:16):**  seismic design category.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:17):**  And most of the US is in those two categories.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:24):**  So that's important to understand, but also that it's not only the Western states that  
**[0:55:33-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:33):**  are subject to earthquakes.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:36):**  Of course, there's Hawaii, it's not part of the contiguous 48 in Alaska.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:43):**  But there are other areas such as the St. Louis area, St. Louis, Memphis, it's known  
**[0:55:49-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:49):**  to be vulnerable to earthquakes.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:52):**  There are coastal parts of the Southeast have some seismic vulnerability.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:59):**  And over recent years, earthquakes have been known to occur in places that just haven't  
**[0:56:07-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:07):**  experienced them in recorded history.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:10):**  So things are changing.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:12):**  Although it's still California, Oregon, Washington, especially that are, and Idaho is another  
**[0:56:19-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:19):**  state that's subjected to, that is subject to high seismic risks.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:24):**  So I just wanted to lay that out geographically for the listener about expectations about  
**[0:56:32-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:32):**  the different wall systems and then relative to seismic risk.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:38):**  But also, and I think you mentioned it earlier, Oliver, there's high wind regions of the country  
**[0:56:45-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:45):**  in the Rockies, Rocky Mountains, of course, any area of the United States that's vulnerable  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:54):**  to tornadoes or certainly hurricanes.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:59):**  So the high wind loads impose lateral loads, not in the same way exactly as earthquakes  
**[0:57:09-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:09):**  do, but the effect on the building can be much the same where it needs to resist these  
**[0:57:15-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:15):**  lateral loads that 99% of the time, 99.9% of the time, the building does not experience  
**[0:57:21-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:21):**  them.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:22):**  But when the building does experience those loads, they need to be able to resist them.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:28):**  Okay.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:29):**  So with all of these changes to the proposed code based on the information that you've  
**[0:57:34-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:34):**  been gathering and the collaboration with other organizations around the world, this  
**[0:57:39-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:39):**  is a lot of information for people to navigate, especially because COD has up until now mostly  
**[0:57:45-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:45):**  been worked with by owner builders and designers and people without perhaps the professional  
**[0:57:51-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:51):**  certifications to navigate these types of codes.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:54):**  Anthony, could you give us a bit of a summary of what is recommended in these documents  
**[0:58:00-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:00):**  for people looking to build and still be compliant to the proposed codes that are ahead?  
**[0:58:07-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:07):**  Yeah, I'm happy to.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:11):**  In a simple statement, it's best when buildings have good boots and a good hat.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:20):**  Brief foundation and appropriate connection and quality roofing system and diaphragm and  
**[0:58:27-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:27):**  appropriate connection.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:29):**  That likely means anchorage of some sort and aspect ratios of wall thicknesses to heights  
**[0:58:40-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:40):**  and wall lengths to heights are important.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:42):**  And we've worked hard at laying out guidelines on recommended wall system makeups.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:51):**  And that is in the proposed code appendix, which is a public document and it's on cobcode.org,  
**[0:58:58-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:58):**  which is CRI's website.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:00):**  And I highly recommend, you know, it's a code document, not all of it's an easy read, but  
**[0:59:07-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:07):**  there are the charts that contain at least the wall makeups that are very accessible  
**[0:59:14-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:14):**  to understand the general options that seem to be the main prevailing tested wall systems  
**[0:59:21-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:21):**  that we have confidence in.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:23):**  Nice.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:24):**  And I know that you talked about anchorage to the foundations and then anchorage up to  
**[0:59:29-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:29):**  the roof as well, kind of being the two most key aspects for structural stability with  
**[0:59:35-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:35):**  this material.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:36):**  I know that getting it to anchor to the foundation is probably the less difficult of those two  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:42):**  things.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:43):**  What kind of anchored system would you recommend to hold strongly to the roof in general?  
**[0:59:48-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:48):**  I realize that there are going to be variables with what people have access to as far as  
**[0:59:52-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:52):**  materials and techniques.  
**[0:59:54-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:54):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:56):**  I actually wouldn't agree that it's more difficult to anchor to your roof system.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:02):**  Most cob wall systems that we've been designing with commonly have wood as their top plates,  
**[1:00:09-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:09):**  which offers a flat wood system for a wood roof framing system to connect to.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:17):**  And then your roof framing is a standard wood construction.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:22):**  There are many other material options, but just they all can go off this analog where  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:27):**  if you have a wood top plate, which is the term for the wood beam that would rest on  
**[1:00:32-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:32):**  top of a wall, you would have anchors sticking down from that top plate, anchor bolts, just  
**[1:00:40-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:40):**  standard bolts that folks would recognize, a half inch, 5-8 inch.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:46):**  And these would be hanging down.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:48):**  You would likely build a shoring system.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:50):**  You don't need to.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:51):**  You could put it up in various ways, but ideally you would build your cob wall up around these  
**[1:00:56-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:56):**  bolts and then your top plate would be placed on top and cinched down then with a nut.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:03):**  And that's the most ideal way to connect a top plate or roofing system to the top of  
**[1:01:09-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:09):**  your wall.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:10):**  In terms of compliance with the proposed cob code, if it, well, I'm not going to say if,  
**[1:01:20-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:20):**  but when, when it's approved and ultimately adopted, the structural compliance with the  
**[1:01:29-1:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:29):**  structural aspects that Anthony talked a bit about is very important.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:36):**  It's central to a safe cob building is that it be safe structurally.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:43):**  And so there are these requirements when cob is used as a structural material that are  
**[1:01:50-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:50):**  contained in the proposed cob code.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:56):**  But to expand from that, this proposed cob appendix, it's a proposed appendix in the  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:05):**  international residential code, which is the national model code for the United States  
**[1:02:10-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:10):**  and can be used anywhere really in the world.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:13):**  Thus its name is with the word international as part of the name.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:19):**  But so this proposed appendix requires that cob buildings comply with everything else  
**[1:02:28-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:28):**  that's in the international residential code unless it's stated otherwise in this appendix.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:37):**  So this, the appendix, it is prime, well, it is about the use of cob as a wall system.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:47):**  All other parts of the building, so the roof system, the foundation, windows and doors,  
**[1:02:54-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:54):**  electrical, plumbing, all those things would need to comply with the what's elsewhere in  
**[1:03:01-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:01):**  the residential code.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:05):**  And so I just to frame it that way is important to understand.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:12):**  Yeah, certainly.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:14):**  It's one of the things that I've tried to impress upon the people that I've taught in  
**[1:03:18-1:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:18):**  cob building.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:19):**  And since I come as well from a conventional building background and got into natural building  
**[1:03:25-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:25):**  later, I think it's very important to know that the same standards of building for safety  
**[1:03:30-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:30):**  and general, yeah, just general standards for how things are installed and the way that  
**[1:03:37-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:37):**  they function is not that different.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:39):**  Really the only thing that changes a bit is the primary material that you're using to  
**[1:03:43-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:43):**  build.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:44):**  But the rest of those safety guidelines are there for very good reason and applied just  
**[1:03:49-1:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:49):**  as much to natural buildings as they do to conventional or industrial ones.  
**[1:03:54-1:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:54):**  Now, so with all of these things outlined and a good sort of summary of what people  
**[1:04:00-1:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:00):**  can expect to look at when building with this material once it gets approved, can you talk  
**[1:04:06-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:06):**  to our listeners about how they can get involved?  
**[1:04:08-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:08):**  Because it is not yet legal or on the books to build with cob, but we're at a crucial  
**[1:04:13-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:13):**  moment here where it very soon could be.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:16):**  John or Martin, would you like to tell us about what the upcoming steps are?  
**[1:04:22-1:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:22):**  So this proposed appendix that our CRI team has put together for the international residential  
**[1:04:30-1:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:30):**  code.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:31):**  And in saying that, I want to mention that this proposal has had input from over 30 people,  
**[1:04:40-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:40):**  design and building professionals who have experience with cob.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:43):**  So it's not only the CRI team, there are people that are directly members of CRI, but many  
**[1:04:52-1:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:52):**  other design and building professionals have had input.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:58):**  And we welcome input in the future because regardless of what happens right now with  
**[1:05:06-1:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:06):**  this code proposal, building codes are living documents and they change over time.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:12):**  So we're really interested to hear input from all sources.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:19):**  But this current proposal, as I mentioned earlier, was unfortunately disapproved.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:26):**  That's the, was disapproved in May at the first code hearings.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:34):**  And we think it was, well, we know it was primarily, if not entirely because of the  
**[1:05:41-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:41):**  fire resistance rating that I mentioned earlier.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:44):**  But we've made adjustments in this next step of the process, which is the second and final  
**[1:05:51-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:51):**  code hearings at the end of this month.  
**[1:05:54-1:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:54):**  We expect those hearings to occur on October 26th.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:01):**  And the location is in Las Vegas.  
**[1:06:06-1:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:06):**  I will be there, Anthony Dente will be there, and a few others to testify in support of  
**[1:06:12-1:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:12):**  the proposal.  
**[1:06:14-1:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:14):**  And in this second step, the decision about approval or disapproval is made by building  
**[1:06:22-1:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:22):**  and fire officials.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:24):**  And that, this is where listeners can help.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:31):**  There will be a vote in the room at the hearings itself, a preliminary vote, I'll call it.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:41):**  There might be somewhere between two and 500 people in the room there voting on the proposal.  
**[1:06:52-1:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:52):**  But more importantly for listeners is there is, will be a subsequent online vote approximately  
**[1:07:01-1:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:01):**  the second two weeks of November.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:04):**  And building officials, building fire officials from all over the country will vote on these,  
**[1:07:10-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:10):**  not only this code proposal, but all of the code proposals that are on the table.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:16):**  So our CRI team has reached out to building officials that we know, and there's a campaign  
**[1:07:24-1:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:24):**  to get out the vote, get out the building official vote for the COB code proposal.  
**[1:07:31-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:31):**  The best way for listener to do that is to go to the CRI's website.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:39):**  So cobcode.org and front and center on the homepage, you'll see a campaign, a link regarding  
**[1:07:50-1:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:50):**  this campaign to get out the vote.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:53):**  And there's lots of information there on how to do that, how to help.  
**[1:07:58-1:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:58):**  And it boils down to mostly people who feel this is an important proposal to them or others  
**[1:08:07-1:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:07):**  that they know to contact their local building official and encourage them to vote for the  
**[1:08:16-1:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:16):**  COB code proposal.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:19):**  They can, or the listener can contact CRI through the website and give us the name and  
**[1:08:31-1:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:31):**  contact information of their building official.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:34):**  They can basically hand it over to CRI and we can take it from there, or they can encourage  
**[1:08:41-1:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:41):**  the building official directly on their own.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:44):**  And how many votes are needed for this to get passed or to be heard?  
**[1:08:49-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:49):**  At this stage in the process, a two thirds majority is required.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:54):**  So that can be challenging, but it is achievable.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:59):**  There are about 30,000 building officials across the United States, building of fire  
**[1:09:05-1:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:05):**  officials, very large number.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:07):**  In practice, not a small percentage of them actually vote on these COB proposals.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:15):**  They're very busy people and they have a lot on their minds.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:19):**  So there are certain ones who are particularly focused on building code development and those  
**[1:09:26-1:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:26):**  are the ones who tend to vote.  
**[1:09:28-1:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:28):**  But any virtually any building or fire official can vote, has the authority to vote.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:40):**  So that's where reaching out to your local building official could cause a building official  
**[1:09:48-1:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:48):**  who, or fire official who may not otherwise vote to do that.  
**[1:09:52-1:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:52):**  If they hear that someone in their community is really interested in this, they're likely  
**[1:09:58-1:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:58):**  to follow through and maybe cast a vote that they wouldn't have otherwise.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:05):**  And in terms of the number of votes, even historically as few as 150 votes can cause  
**[1:10:16-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:16):**  a proposal to pass, to be approved.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:20):**  So you compare that to 30,000, which is a very formidable number, but in practice as  
**[1:10:31-1:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:31):**  few as 100, 150 can make the difference.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:34):**  Wow.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:35):**  Well, that's a definitely positive message and likelihood for this.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:40):**  Tell me about why someone who perhaps either hasn't built with COB or hasn't even thought  
**[1:10:45-1:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:45):**  about it up until now might be interested in making sure that this kind of advancement  
**[1:10:51-1:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:51):**  to the code happens.  
**[1:10:52-1:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:52):**  Well, why would anybody want to have this become a reality?  
**[1:10:58-1:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:58):**  And it's basically because my experience with the CRI has since I got involved has been  
**[1:11:06-1:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:06):**  that because it's become known that I'm involved, people would contact me and say, I want to  
**[1:11:15-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:15):**  build a COB house and I live here and what am I going to do?  
**[1:11:20-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:20):**  And so my response would be basically until there is a COB code, if you're in any place  
**[1:11:27-1:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:27):**  where there's permits required, your options are very limited and you can either build  
**[1:11:35-1:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:35):**  through the alternate materials and methods procedure, which requires engineering and  
**[1:11:41-1:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:41):**  architectural drawings and the attendant expenses and a period of needing to educate your building  
**[1:11:49-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:49):**  department as to what you want to do is actually meets the intent of the code.  
**[1:11:54-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:54):**  It's a big, long drawn out process and requires resources and patience.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:00):**  And this would basically pretty much go away once the IRC COB construction appendix is  
**[1:12:10-1:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:10):**  approved and adopted because at that point, anybody that's in a jurisdiction, a location  
**[1:12:18-1:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:18):**  that requires building permits would be able to go in and say that I want to build a COB  
**[1:12:23-1:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:23):**  building and here's the code I'm going to use.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:27):**  And that would actually make it quite possible for them to then build in their location,  
**[1:12:34-1:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:34):**  which now does not happen.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:36):**  And why is this important is because it means that COB buildings will get built, whereas  
**[1:12:44-1:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:44):**  now they get stopped except for people who are willing to build outside the code realm.  
**[1:12:51-1:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:51):**  And basically we call that outlaw building and all the attendant problems that we've  
**[1:12:56-1:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:56):**  just discussed earlier as far as lack of standards, improper building, poor building.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:06):**  So these are all things that the code is aimed at solving.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:13):**  That's why it's really important.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:16):**  And Oliver, this is Martin.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:19):**  Martin outlined the many good reasons for specific to COB, why it's important that this  
**[1:13:27-1:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:27):**  proposed appendix be approved.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:29):**  And I want to also add some broader reasons for anyone who is interested in what are sometimes  
**[1:13:41-1:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:41):**  called natural building methods and environmentally responsible ways of building that are more  
**[1:13:48-1:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:48):**  responsible than conventional ways of building.  
**[1:13:51-1:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:51):**  The COB code proposal is important because this, by getting COB into the building code,  
**[1:13:59-1:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:59):**  it will pave the way for other natural building systems to follow, including especially other  
**[1:14:05-1:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:05):**  earthen building systems, such as Adobe.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:07):**  Well, Adobe is already in the international building code, but there's even there, there's  
**[1:14:11-1:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:11):**  struggles to correct a lot of deficiencies in that.  
**[1:14:16-1:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:16):**  But Adobe more broadly, rammed earth, earth bag, compressed earth blocks, all those earthen  
**[1:14:21-1:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:21):**  building systems and other natural building systems, along with others, managed to get  
**[1:14:30-1:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:30):**  straw bale construction as an appendix to the international residential code about six  
**[1:14:34-1:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:34):**  years ago.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:36):**  And that helped pave the way for straw clay to enter the building code.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:42):**  So they all help each other.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:45):**  And it's important for that reason, for that reason alone.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:52):**  Also just so people understand, the international residential code, which applies to one and  
**[1:14:57-1:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:57):**  two family dwellings and townhouses, it is the national model code for the United States.  
**[1:15:04-1:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:04):**  So getting anything into that code has broad effect.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:15):**  It's used as the basis for the residential code in virtually every jurisdiction in the  
**[1:15:20-1:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:20):**  United States.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:21):**  And it can be used internationally as well.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:25):**  Marvelous.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:26):**  Now, I mean, this is something that I personally feel very passionate about as a natural builder  
**[1:15:32-1:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:32):**  who's worked around different places in the United States and around the world.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:36):**  Like you said, this has the potential to have ripple effects across the ability to work  
**[1:15:43-1:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:43):**  with any kind of material, not just cob moving out towards in the future, but especially  
**[1:15:48-1:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:48):**  for those earthen materials that have so much potential for the future of building in our  
**[1:15:54-1:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:54):**  country and all of the advantages that they bring with them, especially because they've  
**[1:15:58-1:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:58):**  been proven for much longer periods of time than most of the industrial materials that  
**[1:16:03-1:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:03):**  have come up since then.  
**[1:16:04-1:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:04):**  Now, I don't live in the United States anymore, but I definitely am going to be reaching out  
**[1:16:09-1:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:09):**  to a lot of natural building friends that I have in my network.  
**[1:16:12-1:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:12):**  Could you just remind our audience one more time what they can do to actively help this  
**[1:16:18-1:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:18):**  along and which dates are important to remember?  
**[1:16:22-1:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:22):**  Well, to contact their local building official or fire official and make them aware of this  
**[1:16:29-1:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:29):**  proposal and the importance that cob building has to them, that they want it as a choice  
**[1:16:37-1:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:37):**  in their community.  
**[1:16:41-1:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:41):**  And they can go to CRI's website, cobcode.org, and there's information there about how to  
**[1:16:52-1:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:52):**  proceed.  
**[1:16:55-1:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:55):**  And if you want, you can hand this off to CRI and we can take it from there.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:04):**  One more thing I need to add is that, yeah, one big, really important thing that the listeners  
**[1:17:10-1:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:10):**  can do is to support CRI.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:14):**  We're hampered by funding and we have a crowdfunding campaign, which has been in effect for a while  
**[1:17:21-1:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:21):**  and has brought us in some of the money that we need to pay for all of the work that we're  
**[1:17:29-1:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:29):**  doing, but we definitely need more support.  
**[1:17:32-1:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:32):**  And so I encourage all the listeners who care about seeing this become a reality to log  
**[1:17:42-1:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:42):**  onto our website and go to the crowdfunding campaign and donate to CRI.  
**[1:17:53-1:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:53):**  That would be incredibly appreciated and will go a long ways towards helping us cover costs  
**[1:18:01-1:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:01):**  we've already incurred for this work and to help us pay for all of our needed future testing.  
**[1:18:14-1:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:14):**  Very important.  
**[1:18:15-1:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:15):**  So please support CRI.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:17):**  Donate.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:18):**  Certainly.  
**[1:18:19-1:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:19):**  Well, thank you so much, John.  
**[1:18:20-1:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:20):**  Martin, I really appreciate the time.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:23):**  Anthony had to run off to another meeting and I know that there are others helping in  
**[1:18:27-1:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:27):**  this effort and members of the CRI that have helped to bring about this potential change  
**[1:18:33-1:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:33):**  that could improve the possibilities for so many people, especially owner builders like  
**[1:18:38-1:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:38):**  myself and others who are listening.  
**[1:18:40-1:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:40):**  So again, thank you so much for your time.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:42):**  Let's stay in touch.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:43):**  I look forward to seeing the results of this as it comes up at the end of the month and  
**[1:18:49-1:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:49):**  more advancements for owner building and alternative building practices in general.  
**[1:18:54-1:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:54):**  Thank you so much for making this interview possible.  
**[1:18:58-1:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:58):**  Very much appreciated.  
**[1:18:59-1:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:59):**  Thank you.  
**[1:19:00-1:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:19:00):**  All right.  
**[1:19:01-1:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:19:01):**  That wraps things up for this week's episode.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:19:04):**  If you enjoyed this interview and want to find more like it, as well as articles and

**[1:19:14-1:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:19:14):**  The best part is that you can search by topic rather than wading through more than 100 interviews  
**[1:19:18-1:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:19:18):**  by typing in any keyword or topic that you're looking for in the search function on the  
**[1:19:22-1:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:19:22):**  podcast page.  
**[1:19:23-1:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:19:23):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from

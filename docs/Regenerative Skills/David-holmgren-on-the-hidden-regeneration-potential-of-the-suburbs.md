**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:00:12):**  So I know there's a lot of buzz and interest around agroforestry and food forest these  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:00:18):**  days, but do you really know what the difference is between an orchard and a food forest?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:00:23):**  Or how to choose the right species for your climate and soil conditions?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:00:26):**  How about companion plants and the various strata of a forest?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:00:30):**  And if you're looking to make money and sell products, how can you make a business  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:00:33):**  plan and calculate expenses and profit from a system that could take years to mature?

**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:01):**  works.

**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:06):**  Welcome back everybody!  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:07):**  Now, I've had the privilege of being able to travel to many places around the world  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:11):**  to design and manage projects for organizations and clients, and one of the constants that  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:16):**  I find, whether it's getting a natural home off the ground, planting an agroforestry plantation,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:21):**  or even remotely consulting with someone on their dream project, is that the community  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:26):**  element is often the most overlooked.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:29):**  Now time and time again I've seen projects stall or move backwards because they think  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:33):**  they just don't have the monetary or material resources to continue, when in fact it's  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:38):**  their social capital which is lacking.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:41):**  On the other side, I've seen the power of collaboration overcome shortages of money  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:45):**  and institutional support as neighbors and friends offer their creativity, expertise,  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:49):**  or even just emotional support to get past the inevitable hurdles that come up.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:54):**  Despite this though, there are far fewer resources and courses in the regenerative fields on  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:02:57):**  how to build social capital, involve and connect your community, or how to even apply patterns  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:02):**  of nature to organize people and our institutions.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:05):**  So today we're going to continue with this series by going into the source of permaculture  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:10):**  study by speaking to the co-originator of permaculture, David Holmgren.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:15):**  So back in 1978, he and Bill Mollison published Permaculture One, starting the global permaculture  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:22):**  movement.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:23):**  And since then, David has developed three properties, consulted and supervised on urban  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:27):**  and rural projects, written eight more books, and presented lectures, workshops, and courses  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:31):**  on Australia and around the world.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:34):**  His writings over these three decades span a diversity of subjects and issues, whilst  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:38):**  always illuminating aspects of permaculture thinking and living.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:42):**  While there are endless things that I could ask David about, in this interview, we focus  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:46):**  on his newest book, Retro Suburbia, The Downshifters Guide to a Resilient Future, his 592 page  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:53):**  manual showing how Australians can downshift and retrofit their homes, gardens, and selves  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:03:59):**  for resilience into an uncertain future.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:02):**  In this episode, we talk about why he chose to focus on the suburbs when many people are  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:07):**  now looking to abandon them and move to more rural areas.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:10):**  We explore the potential that there is in retrofitting the infrastructure of peri-urban  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:14):**  environments that were poorly designed and the source of much wasteful energy and material  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:19):**  use.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:20):**  This is a wide-ranging conversation that explores the evolution of permaculture, various cohabitation  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:25):**  arrangements, getting around strict regulations, and so much more.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:28):**  And I've been excited about this interview for a long time.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:32):**  So with all of this out of the way, here's David Holmgren.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:36):**  David, thank you so much for taking time to be here.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:39):**  I am really excited to talk about this for a lot of things that we just talked about  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:42):**  for a second earlier.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:45):**  Looking at a lot of these aspects of lifestyle design, landscape design, and home design  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:52):**  that are quite frequently overlooked because they're not the easy to point to patterns  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:04:58):**  in nature that are often used to illustrate permaculture principles, but clearly have  
**[0:05:02-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:02):**  a lot of untapped potential to be leveraged for the type of holistic or sustainable living  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:11):**  that so many people aspire to.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:13):**  And so I first wanted to ask you why you chose to focus your most recent book on the suburbs,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:21):**  because this is where everybody's trying to flee from right now.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:24):**  It's where people think that there's not really much hope of fixing or obtaining the type  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:30):**  of lifestyle that they aspire to from permaculture teachings.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:33):**  What caused you to focus on that?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:35):**  Yeah, well, I suppose going back historically, there's no doubt that in the 1970s and 1980s  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:45):**  in Australia, the early phases of permaculture involved a strong connection to the back to  
**[0:05:51-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:05:51):**  the land movement and that shift to rural design and often on clean slate sites, you  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:01):**  know, green fields design sites, blank slates.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:05):**  But it was also a huge sort of uptake, especially early on before the Thatcherite, Reaganite  
**[0:06:12-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:12):**  sort of economic and social revolution in the 80s made it much more unfavourable in  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:20):**  the suburbs.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:21):**  But in Australia, there was this huge interest in permaculture in the suburbs.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:26):**  And I always saw suburban scale as potentially a sweet point between the density and connectivity  
**[0:06:37-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:37):**  that we associate with cities, but also enough space and capacity to modify and control one's  
**[0:06:47-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:47):**  immediate living environment and space to grow food, space to store and fabricate materials,  
**[0:06:57-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:06:57):**  small household scale, non monetary economy that we associate with rural areas and rural  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:07:07):**  capacities and lifestyles.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:07:10):**  And that the potential to retrofit suburbs, even though they weren't designed for a regenerative  
**[0:07:19-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:07:19):**  future with challenging conditions like climate emergency and resource depletion and all of  
**[0:07:27-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:07:27):**  the other threats that are unfolding around us, that they had that potential for incremental  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:07:36):**  householder led retrofit.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:07:39):**  Whereas what I saw in the inner cities at higher density, there was a lot more stakeholders,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:07:46):**  it was a lot more technically complex to retrofit high density residential and other infrastructure.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:07:55):**  And you have to wait till society is more on board with this common sense, in some cases  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:01):**  before you can even start.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:04):**  And then in terms of rural environments, the idea of a mass migration to rural areas before  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:13):**  we were already deep in these, the limits to growth crises that are unfolding around  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:20):**  us was unrealistic.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:21):**  People were going to largely adapt in situ, short of catastrophic failures of, you know,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:30):**  collapses of infrastructure and supply chains, the sort of fleeing from the city en masse  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:36):**  isn't going to happen.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:38):**  And so people are going to sort of adapt in situ.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:42):**  And a lot of that daption will be around the built environment and the biological gardening,  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:51):**  but it very powerfully it's around the behavioral and living arrangements, because that's where  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:08:57):**  the great flexibility is.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:00):**  And then in that you tap into the knowledge and the skill that people have the connections  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:07):**  in their communities, rather than having to start afresh.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:11):**  And I suppose over the decades, seeing so many people do the move to the country, I've  
**[0:09:17-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:17):**  known lots of people who said, wow, actually, my suburban garden was more productive than  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:25):**  where I moved to in the bush battling the wildlife and often actually more infertile  
**[0:09:31-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:31):**  soils and, and all of the complexities of rural self-reliance that require us to not  
**[0:09:39-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:39):**  just maybe large projects of building houses, but also water infrastructure and dealing  
**[0:09:47-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:47):**  with natural hazards like in Australia, bushfire or other hazards that we have to sort of be  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:57):**  do more for ourselves.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:09:59):**  And that shift, although it can be incredibly empowering for some people, it can be incredibly  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:06):**  challenging and difficult because there can be so many learning curves that the people  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:12):**  are having to navigate.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:14):**  So there's some of the reasons why the reemergence of my focus on the suburbs over the last 20  
**[0:10:27-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:27):**  years in the work leading up to the publication of Retro-Suburbia in 2018.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:36):**  For sure.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:37):**  And before we start talking about the specific potentials of different types of retrofits  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:42):**  and where there are kind of leverage points to make real change, let's focus in on some  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:49):**  of the real challenges.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:50):**  And we're still focusing on the suburban configuration of Australia and to a similar state, the United  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:10:58):**  States, Canada, and other places that have mostly developed their infrastructure since  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:02):**  the proliferation of cars, right?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:05):**  The larger scale that people can access due to rapid personal transit, right?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:11):**  Where are the real hurdles, the things that are preventing us from living a more sustainable  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:18):**  and connected life in these configurations?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:21):**  Well, I think the first would not be actually around infrastructure, but it's actually around  
**[0:11:28-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:28):**  debt because that drives the cycle of often in a household, you know, two partners often  
**[0:11:37-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:37):**  as parents of children, both working away to pay the mortgage.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:45):**  And that locks people in to an extent on commuting and takes them away from the ability to navigate  
**[0:11:57-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:11:57):**  the day to day intimate requirements of the sort of home non-military economy and whether  
**[0:12:06-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:12:06):**  that's looking after children or, you know, feeding the chickens or watering the garden  
**[0:12:15-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:12:15):**  or doing little things that can work in with a working day when you have a home-based lifestyle,  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:12:24):**  but that absence and that commuting lifestyle.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:12:26):**  And of course that is often then locking people into car dependence.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:12:32):**  So I suppose I have been very aware that for more than two decades, that information and  
**[0:12:39-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:12:39):**  technology was one of the positive wildcards in our modern situation, that the commute  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:12:48):**  was not actually essential for huge numbers of people, but it took until the pandemic  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:12:54):**  to sort of break this spell that everyone was under, all institutions and businesses  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:01):**  that know everyone's got to come into the office.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:04):**  And obviously that made us aware of the divide between those who could work digitally and  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:12):**  those who couldn't.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:15):**  But I still think there's huge capacities for home-based lifestyles.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:21):**  For example, the miniaturization and reduced cost of tools, say for carpentry or metal  
**[0:13:29-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:29):**  working means that a lot of people in a suburban garage even have, if maybe poor quality, then  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:37):**  professional quality tools that would in a poorer country would support someone in a  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:44):**  garage-based home manufacturing or repair business.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:50):**  Whereas 50 or let alone a hundred years ago, the sort of scale of tools, you know, the  
**[0:13:56-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:13:56):**  large cast iron thickness for turning rough sawn timber into milled timber compared with  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:05):**  modern small amazingly cheap machines, even when you actually look at the higher quality  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:11):**  professional components.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:13):**  So this miniaturization of tool manufacturing, let alone, you know, people talking about  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:19):**  3D printers and all the latest iteration of manufacturing potential.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:27):**  So the possibilities of one-off small scale, both manufacturing and repair, especially  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:35):**  repair and retrofit activities.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:37):**  So there's possibility that a lot of livelihoods could be more home-based, can overcome those  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:46):**  impediments to the need to commute.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:51):**  But the challenges of course, of people on that treadmill of debt, which is related to  
**[0:14:57-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:14:57):**  the bubble economies of ridiculously perpetually inflating, apparently real estate values,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:07):**  which is a sort of a curious thing that sort of appears to defy the laws of gravity, which  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:15):**  is of course another larger contextual issue in which people are working.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:20):**  Yeah, we really seem to be in the throes of it once again, kind of brought on by the pandemic  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:26):**  where everyone's looking to move out of urban centers now, seeing them as more of a risk  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:31):**  than they used to be.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:32):**  And also the commoditization of real estate, it becoming more of a financial instrument  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:38):**  than a place where you live and tend.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:41):**  And that has really changed the way that especially people of lower income and young families  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:48):**  can access their own property.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:50):**  And I know for myself in the past, it has been a real barrier for feeling that I can  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:15:55):**  do any sort of retrofits or make any changes to the place because I don't have decision-making  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:00):**  power.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:01):**  Right.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:02):**  And that goes back to what you were saying about debt being one of the biggest inhibitors  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:07):**  for the transformation of these areas that have so much potential.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:12):**  And where do you see the opportunities to move away from that?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:18):**  Because I know you write a lot about different living configurations in the same space that  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:23):**  we used to have just maybe a couple of people.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:25):**  Yeah, well, I think the first one is the recognition historically that in tough times, depressions  
**[0:16:34-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:34):**  and other challenges, average household size tends to increase, more people living together,  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:43):**  sharing for because of the efficiencies of economies of scale, and in some cases for  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:48):**  just household security in difficult times.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:52):**  And most of those larger households tend to be extended family.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:16:58):**  But there's all sorts of other configurations.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:00):**  And my understanding that especially in the United States, since the global financial  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:06):**  crisis, there's been in some areas, this reversal of household size getting smaller and smaller  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:12):**  to it actually going back the other way.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:14):**  And this is actually one of those measures of difficulty.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:18):**  And you could say that historically leads to crowding and all of the other disadvantages.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:24):**  But because we have the largest buildings, the largest residential space in history,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:30):**  in terms of number of square meters per person, there is a lot of if you like fat in the system,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:36):**  and opportunities for more people to share, or more people to be using their spaces more  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:45):**  effectively.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:46):**  So that what I mentioned previously, of breaking the commuting spell, and being a home more  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:52):**  home based lifestyle, massively increases the number of hours of occupancy.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:17:57):**  So effective, efficient use of those buildings.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:02):**  And that means also reduced costs of living because it's not so many people on the run  
**[0:18:09-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:09):**  eating takeaway food and traveling costs, and also not so exposed to the lures of consumption  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:19):**  that are constantly there in the in the mobile city lifestyle.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:25):**  But I think the relationships when people are not owners, to building creative relationships  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:31):**  with those who do own.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:33):**  And that's, of course, one of those things, one of those patterns is the people taking  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:38):**  in a household border, taking in someone who's actually sharing house with you, who is not  
**[0:18:45-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:45):**  family, and not an owner and navigating that asymmetric power relationships that are inevitably  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:18:55):**  there, but they're also relatively intimate relations.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:00):**  And I think that there's been a reluctance both on the part of mostly young people who  
**[0:19:07-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:07):**  are not owners, and older people who are owners to sort of accept the things they need to  
**[0:19:15-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:15):**  sort of give up a bit for, you know, older owners give up some of the sense of privacy  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:23):**  and complete control over one's space.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:29):**  And except the issue that there can be conflicts, and that you can navigate those.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:37):**  And the confidence that you as an owner are in actually a very powerful position, that  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:42):**  you need to get over the distaste that most so many middle class people, especially in  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:48):**  societies like Australia, feel, oh, we're all equal, aren't we?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:53):**  No, we're not.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:19:54):**  And having to sort of deal with look at the end of your tenancy, I would like you to leave  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:00):**  this is not working out for me.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:02):**  That is very distasteful of actually having to exercise power over someone you actually  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:07):**  know very well.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:09):**  And so but that is reality.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:12):**  That is the economic reality.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:14):**  And we should, you know, face that reality and deal with it at personal level.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:19):**  At the other level, young people often are no, I can't do anything, because I don't own  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:25):**  it.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:26):**  And what I used to say to people when I was young, when they said, Why do you do all this  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:30):**  work on different projects, you know, people, other people's property, and I'd say, Look,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:36):**  what I take away in my head from the experience of doing things is more valuable than the  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:42):**  asset improvement that I've left behind.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:46):**  So that thing of engaging with others.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:50):**  And what that means is whether that's in a sort of more intimate relationship in a household,  
**[0:20:56-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:20:56):**  or whether it's actually where you as a renter, know personally, the owner, and you deal with  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:05):**  the owner without the middleman without the real estate agent, because the function of  
**[0:21:10-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:10):**  the real estate agent is to keep the parties apart and in fear of one another.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:19):**  And exercise that control in the middle.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:22):**  Now that's not universal for all real estate agents, but it seems to me, it's the pattern  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:27):**  of the industry.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:30):**  So that it's actually that holding that central space that Oh, no, you can't dig up the lawn  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:37):**  and put a garden in there.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:40):**  Because I've told the owner that it will actually reduce the value of their property.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:46):**  You know, whereas if you actually have a direct relationship with an owner, often, sometimes  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:21:53):**  those things can be navigated, because there are people who actually do want something  
**[0:22:00-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:00):**  sort of different and finding those direct connections between owners and occupiers,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:08):**  I think is is some of the huge opportunities to get past some of these blockages.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:17):**  That makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:18):**  And it's played out a few times in my life, I've traveled around the world and lived in  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:21):**  a lot of different configurations.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:23):**  And much like you said, especially for younger people, we find ourselves in a tenant role,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:28):**  whether in a co housing situation, renting a room, or you know, there are a lot of different  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:33):**  configurations that people are trying out these days, some with more access to influence  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:38):**  the living environment and some with less.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:41):**  And do you see that there's much potential in breaking this cycle of everybody coming  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:46):**  back together and realizing the necessity of connection only in times of scarcity.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:52):**  And then as soon as they start to have more resources, more power and more flexibility,  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:22:58):**  they quickly forget that again and start to separate.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:01):**  Are there ways of holding on to this connection, even as we enter into times of flourishing  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:07):**  as well?  
**[0:23:08-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:08):**  Yeah, well, let's I, I see historically, that is a fairly strong pattern.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:19):**  For example, I mean, the greatest intentional community movement in the world was really  
**[0:23:26-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:26):**  probably the kibbutz movement, you know, which really ended up founding a nation state.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:33):**  But by the 1970s, you know, although the kibbutzniks were the elite of Israeli society, the lure  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:42):**  of the city and once the country felt more comfortable and not under immediate threat  
**[0:23:49-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:49):**  of being demolished by its neighbors, the flight of people from the collective life  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:23:58):**  of the kibbutz to the more autonomous life of the city was sort of, you know, very hard  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:05):**  to resist.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:08):**  Maybe it was in 1970, the kibbutz got television and they started to see Dallas and other things.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:16):**  You know, so there's a very interesting historical example there of obviously Israel became a  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:23):**  more powerful and affluent country and that need for the sort of collective living sort  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:31):**  of attenuated.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:32):**  I suppose I see the future is not so much one of likely material and energetic abundance,  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:45):**  but we will have to learn community abundance and spiritual abundance, if you like, non  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:52):**  material.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:24:53):**  And, I mean, these are some of the oldest lessons in history that the challenges will  
**[0:25:00-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:00):**  allow us to develop a rich life, but that will be dependent on the quality of our relationships  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:09):**  at the individual level, at the household level, at the neighborhood level and in a  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:15):**  larger community sense.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:18):**  And that will keep us in that glue of interdependence where I need to resolve difficult things with  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:28):**  people because I am interdependent.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:31):**  We are interdependent on each other rather than I am a completely autonomous person apparently  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:40):**  in the bubble of the technosphere that provides all my needs, which of course is what has  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:46):**  led to the atomization in society where, you know, we can get all our needs through monetary  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:25:53):**  and digital interactions and that don't actually really apparently depend on any other person.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:26:01):**  Well I think the future, whatever its form, will require more and more interdependence  
**[0:26:09-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:26:09):**  between people and that has the potential to reverse the catastrophic levels of loneliness  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:26:21):**  and depression and other things that are clearly symptoms of that, but it will also require  
**[0:26:28-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:26:28):**  us to navigate a lot of better skills in communication, conflict resolution and all of those things.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:26:38):**  Yeah and it seems to be the type of skill set that if you develop at an early age out  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:26:44):**  of necessity or just because that was the culture around you, it's much easier to bring

**[0:27:20-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:27:20):**  Exactly and that is an asset you know and it's one of the downsides of what's happened

**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:28:42):**  was exactly the configuration that we kind of moved around in until we moved to the United

**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:28:57):**  and in the suburbs which we eventually moved to and I see a lot of people especially depending  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:29:03):**  on their political leanings idealizing that lifestyle but when they don't have reference

**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:29:36):**  of understanding communication skills and patience that's required to live a more intimate  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:29:42):**  and communally focused lifestyle?  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:29:45):**  Yeah well there's no doubt that the intentional communities movement has thrown up a lot of  
**[0:29:50-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:29:50):**  experience, wisdom and processes for dealing with decision making, collective decision

**[0:30:08-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:30:08):**  of the people who we've worked closely with over the years such as Glen Ochre who was  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:30:18):**  the common ground community that we were quite strongly involved with and her lineage of  
**[0:30:24-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:30:24):**  work and other people connected to the intentional communities movement but I think there's also  
**[0:30:34-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:30:34):**  many examples of where just the inspiration that we see in a lot of certainly in Anglo-American  
**[0:30:46-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:30:46):**  societies of different ethnic groups which are actually much more familiar and comfortable  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:30:55):**  with extended family interactions and relationships with multi-generational families but it's  
**[0:31:03-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:03):**  interesting the cover of retro suburbia as an example that's two sisters and their husbands  
**[0:31:11-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:11):**  and their kids in a two bedroom house in Melbourne that they don't have much debt on and live  
**[0:31:20-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:20):**  home based lifestyle.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:24):**  Well the woman in the front she works as an integrated pest management expert actually  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:29):**  so she works away from home.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:33):**  The cargo bike is actually a thing that's manufactured in a workshop in the backyard  
**[0:31:39-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:39):**  and the other guy's a plotter and the other sister is a full-time mum at home and that  
**[0:31:47-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:47):**  synergies at Hibby Farm was a sort of an incredible example when we met them of what retro suburbia  
**[0:31:58-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:31:58):**  is about and I suppose that sometimes something like that where there's you know a couple  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:32:06):**  sisters or brothers who are actually very close and they're you know then forming relationships  
**[0:32:12-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:32:12):**  around that sort of existing cell rather than the usual idea that okay there's two partners  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:32:20):**  who've come together and then a household sort of clusters around that and whether that's  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:32:26):**  you know friends or part-time people.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:32:30):**  I suppose we've had patterns over the years with our own immediate family and volunteers  
**[0:32:39-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:32:39):**  and interns and then a home office where you know the people who work in this office you  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:32:49):**  know two days a week are actually at meals with us so there's these different things  
**[0:32:55-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:32:55):**  about the way the number of people who might live together but also how much the house  
**[0:33:04-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:33:04):**  and the property is a centre for other activity because that then can create community which  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:33:13):**  is not actually completely the living under one roof together and so that brings in that  
**[0:33:19-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:33:19):**  whole neighbourhood and network community where there's more things being done at that  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:33:28):**  space rather than necessarily say in the public domain so people are used to navigating and  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:33:36):**  in some ways it's just like you know having lots of people to dinner or for a barbecue  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:33:42):**  or kids coming and doing stuff and kids in the neighbourhood self-organising that of  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:33:48):**  course is some of the things that we're trying to stimulate in retro suburbia but whether  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:33:53):**  it's taking down the fences between the backyards or just psychologically opening up that space  
**[0:34:00-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:00):**  so people recolonise the street and the neighbourhood and of course children let free range as they  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:09):**  were in previous generations naturally do that gluing together a community as well by  
**[0:34:16-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:16):**  their own less regulated activities in the public space and that then draws in what might  
**[0:34:25-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:25):**  be more separate busy household adults into that greater connection.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:34):**  Yeah and all of these things that you're talking about are really revolutionary for the way  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:41):**  that suburbs were designed and sort of intended from inception but I'm sure you've seen  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:46):**  from your travels as I have from mine that this is not at all uncommon in most parts  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:51):**  of the world I mean the example that you used of having two couples and all of their kids  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:34:55):**  in a two bedroom house I've seen that configuration and a lot tighter like single room houses  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:01):**  with extended family grandparents and aunts and that not being strange at all and not  
**[0:35:07-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:07):**  even necessarily only related to poverty either I can think of like in Morocco where even  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:15):**  in larger houses with multiple rooms oftentimes everybody would sleep in the living room the  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:20):**  family room together and the way that their houses are designed there's actually couches  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:25):**  built into the walls all the way along and grandparents and grandkids or you know the  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:31):**  whole configuration often will spend time just in that room in order to interact and  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:36):**  the all of the different tasks that come to you know what was often broken down to home  
**[0:35:43-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:43):**  economics in a schooling sense is just a regular part of life and taken as the baseline way  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:51):**  of interacting and supporting oneself so that all of these tasks are not outsourced especially  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:35:57):**  to people outside of this sphere of trust and confidence and I'm wondering do you have  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:36:03):**  any other specific examples that you have highlighted in the book or that you've drawn  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:36:07):**  inspiration from places outside of the suburbs that we're talking about now?  
**[0:36:13-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:36:13):**  Yeah well I think the that's very true in in terms of the the life in in other parts  
**[0:36:24-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:36:24):**  of the world but I suppose I've introduced that through the migration story to you know  
**[0:36:32-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:36:32):**  the affluent immigrant countries like United States and very much like Australia and I've  
**[0:36:41-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:36:41):**  interpreted that through storytelling so before the retro suburbia book for a decade or more  
**[0:36:49-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:36:49):**  I was telling this story of Aussie street four houses and how they change and the people  
**[0:36:57-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:36:57):**  in them changed from the 1950s through the decades up to the present and on into the

**[0:37:14-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:37:14):**  story in a context of historical lineage and in a sense telling our own history of the  
**[0:37:23-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:37:23):**  suburbs and so that story of course is drawn from my own and other people's childhood experiences  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:37:32):**  and includes the difference of migrants Italian at one end and Dutch migrants in the in the

**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:37:48):**  it down for the first time in the as a chapter in the retro suburbia book but more recently  
**[0:37:55-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:37:55):**  we've turned it into a kids book called our street which is the story told from the perspective  
**[0:38:05-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:38:05):**  of one of the children in each of the decades and seeing that change so part of that allows  
**[0:38:14-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:38:14):**  us to see that even over living memory there's been a huge difference of of patterns and  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:38:23):**  the suburbs as people see as a snapshot in the modern world is not actually a fixed thing  
**[0:38:29-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:38:29):**  and that so many of the the models of what we need to do actually exist in the recent  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:38:38):**  past and we can pick and choose from some of those things we don't have to adopt all  
**[0:38:43-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:38:43):**  the you know the social values and you know the technologies of the 1950s but there are  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:38:51):**  many aspects about the way that life was without romanticizing that that are actually incredibly  
**[0:38:59-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:38:59):**  appropriate and capable of happening today and so that's partly the retro in retro suburbia  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:39:07):**  obviously it refers to the you know very practical retrofitting to make fit for new purposes  
**[0:39:14-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:39:14):**  but it's also that retro in in a sense of fashion style or harking back to some past  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:39:23):**  that was positive so we're unashamed about that you know it's a very deliberate way of  
**[0:39:30-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:39:30):**  of portraying that and owning that history and that we can you know reclaim some of these  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:39:38):**  things like what I said about children free-ranging I mean we know the psychological damage that's  
**[0:39:44-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:39:44):**  been done by this clawing control of children's lives and the the data on ranging territory  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:39:52):**  which has collapsed and how people have succumbed to this paranoia and fear projected by the  
**[0:39:58-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:39:58):**  media which then becomes self-fulfilling of how dangerous it is to you know for children  
**[0:40:05-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:40:05):**  to be out on their own and this enormous what appears to be this unstoppable you know suffocation  
**[0:40:13-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:40:13):**  and of children that almost everywhere people older people comment on as a bad thing and  
**[0:40:20-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:40:20):**  feeling sorry for for children today and say well why don't we just reject that pattern  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:40:29):**  and move back the other way so and and and reclaim it you know that we can and we can  
**[0:40:36-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:40:36):**  do that in a design sense where we say yep we will take that pattern or or what was done  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:40:44):**  by our grandparents but yeah we know won't necessarily be using the technology or you  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:40:51):**  know some of the other social values or attitudes there were whether it's to the role of women  
**[0:40:58-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:40:58):**  or or whatever you know in that process so that that picking through our cultural heritage  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:08):**  and say we can design new patterns that are intentional and that are fit for purpose in  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:14):**  you know as we find itself so I found that through storytelling has been one of the best  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:20):**  ways to communicate that oh that certainly makes sense that's one of the best ways to  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:25):**  communicate anything and I really like what you're talking about about how the infrastructure  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:31):**  of of the past and many of the ideas and the ways of life can inform the way that we move  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:37):**  towards a future of less material and less energetic wealth and it seems like we have  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:43):**  a unique privilege and opportunity right now to do that for some more existential reasons  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:50):**  like wanting to take care of the planet and such because we do seem to be headed quite  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:54):**  quickly towards a future where that is not optional and those who use the resources right  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:41:59):**  now in order to shift the infrastructure and the patterns in order to meet that future  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:42:05):**  where those will not be quite as abundant will be very far ahead in the transition that  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:42:11):**  will become very necessary and you've outlined really well in the book how to start to do  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:42:16):**  that on small properties and especially within homes which we were talking earlier is one  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:42:22):**  of the parts that's most often overlooked especially in permaculture design principles  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:42:26):**  maybe partly because it's considered zone zero and everybody starts learning their permaculture  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:42:32):**  design courses out in the garden starting from zone one on out but that much like the

**[0:42:58-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:42:58):**  people can start to make meaningful changes without huge upheavals to move their lives  
**[0:43:05-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:05):**  in that direction given the kind of incompatible infrastructure that they're probably starting  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:11):**  from.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:12):**  Yeah well that's very true and of course retro suburbia is organized as virtually three books  
**[0:43:18-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:18):**  that built the biological and the behavioral and the built environment of course involves  
**[0:43:25-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:25):**  issues of water supply, water harvesting and reuse, waste water reuse, energy efficiency  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:33):**  and heating and cooling and all of the other sort of aspects of built systems but often  
**[0:43:40-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:40):**  those what we inherit evaluating those can be a thing where people fall between two stools  
**[0:43:49-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:49):**  of that there's at one extreme there's this house has always been a good place to live  
**[0:43:57-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:43:57):**  it'll be fine no matter what the future delivers a sort of naive ignoring of you know oh what  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:44:05):**  will gas prices be or you know like where does my water come from all of those really  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:44:12):**  basic questions of just taking those things for granted through to the other level of

**[0:45:08-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:45:08):**  the classic ones are sort of quite simple retrofits for example in relation to waste  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:45:15):**  management not just reducing water use but the critical importance of safely recycling

**[0:45:55-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:45:55):**  and then the next level up is a compost toilet where the sort of bucket systems that we show  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:46:02):**  in the book or slightly more elaborate ones made based on retrofitting the wheelie bin  
**[0:46:08-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:46:08):**  the classic plastic 200 litre rubbish bin that seems to be a universal technology everywhere  
**[0:46:18-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:46:18):**  in the world to sort of yeah add to doing something without that may not actually be  
**[0:46:26-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:46:26):**  legal but when done in an appropriate way is completely safe and appropriate so things  
**[0:46:35-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:46:35):**  like that right through to my favourite one of course in cool temperate climates is the

**[0:47:06-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:47:06):**  heat the house as well as creating a growing space a halfway inside outside space and sometimes  
**[0:47:16-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:47:16):**  can be done either in areas where even heritage regulations prevent modification at the front

**[0:47:37-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:47:37):**  sort of a small addition but it transforms the thermal performance of the house and the

**[0:47:53-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:47:53):**  we also talk about wood energy of safe and minimal polluting ways of burning wood as

**[0:48:18-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:48:18):**  of reconnecting to sort of more simple basic ways of doing things of course because we're  
**[0:48:29-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:48:29):**  in Australia the whole rainwater tanks and water harvesting of course are a part of a

**[0:49:16-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:49:16):**  and all of those things to sort of make that design process a little easier for our soldiers  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:49:23):**  so there's some of the some of the things we focus on it's so fun for me to hear you  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:49:30):**  talking about all of these things because it was my window into eventually getting into  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:49:36):**  landscape design and regenerative agriculture and restoration was through the home my first

**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:49:46):**  these transitions and hearing how you apply the permaculture principles that you helped  
**[0:49:52-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:49:52):**  to establish with Bill Mollison to the built environment is has been a huge inspiration  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:49:59):**  for me that eventually morphed into understanding the ecology of the natural world much better  
**[0:50:04-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:50:04):**  and it's it's still something that I love and here in Spain because my partner and I  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:50:11):**  have been looking for a while to move out of the apartment where we are even before

**[0:50:22-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:50:22):**  and a half years since I moved here one of the big conclusions or or understandings that  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:50:28):**  I have come to here not having much reference to it before this is how infrastructure

**[0:50:41-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:50:41):**  small towns take us on tours of these semi dilapidated properties where they didn't have

**[0:50:51-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:50:51):**  was just for animals and there was feed troughs still there and there were small sleeping

**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:51:03):**  were just above that to make use of the heat coming off of the animals while they were  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:51:07):**  down in the pens and so many other aspects of the things that we are now trying to retrofit  
**[0:51:13-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:51:13):**  our infrastructure which was built for an energy abundant and transportation rich existence

**[0:51:27-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:51:27):**  of not only individual housing but the entire town configuration you know the the streets

**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:51:51):**  with water features in the center that would be the water that you would use for all functions  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:51:55):**  but also channeling air through cooling it down and raising it up for infection in the

**[0:52:07-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:52:07):**  for comfort and functionality before all of this abundance was available as an inspiration  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:52:14):**  for how we might be able to update and return to a simpler way without having to bring in

**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:52:27):**  the inspiration of the evaporative cooling and ground cooling is something that we've  
**[0:52:33-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:52:33):**  done in our built from scratch passive solar house but also showed how that can be retrofitted  
**[0:52:43-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:52:43):**  for cool cupboard storage in kitchens which are not a replacement for a fridge but incredible  
**[0:52:51-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:52:51):**  really reduce the need for refrigeration from just having air ground and evaporative cooling  
**[0:53:01-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:01):**  ducted through a cupboard which is of course an adaption of those systems that that you  
**[0:53:07-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:07):**  were talking about and I think it's you may also be interested in the theory I have going  
**[0:53:14-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:14):**  to the Mediterranean in the late 90s of why even in rural areas the houses small and two  
**[0:53:22-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:22):**  and even three stories and all of the sort of reasons you gave there's also another one  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:28):**  I believe that the limiting technology with traditional materials was roofing materials  
**[0:53:34-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:34):**  and in a lot of places it is of course terracotta tiles made on someone's leg a thick heavy  
**[0:53:40-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:40):**  piece of clay all interlocked and that required a very heavy roof structure and whether that  
**[0:53:50-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:50):**  was that or in some places even stone building a small building under that roof and having  
**[0:53:58-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:53:58):**  all those functions stacked was more efficient than a larger building whereas I would see  
**[0:54:09-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:54:09):**  some of the breakthroughs of modern technology that in the 19th century that led to corrugated  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:54:16):**  iron roofing like we have in Australia as a vernacular roofing system which even though  
**[0:54:21-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:54:21):**  when I showed photos of my house to French ecological building designers in 94 they said  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:54:29):**  oh this is an industrial material I said oh well in Australia it is vernacular architecture  
**[0:54:35-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:54:35):**  but that allowed large roofs and then water collecting in tanks that could be made with  
**[0:54:43-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:54:43):**  the same material and so that recognizing that transformation of design limitations  
**[0:54:52-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:54:52):**  that come with particular things that change the context and you know make possible different  
**[0:55:01-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:01):**  design configurations whereas yeah traditional materials all of those fantastic qualities  
**[0:55:08-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:08):**  of natural materials but we hybridize those things you know we have walls of adobe and  
**[0:55:16-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:16):**  roofs of corrugated iron on lightweight spanning truss structures.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:23):**  Yeah I've seen pictures and schematics of your home it's really wonderful and I also  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:28):**  love the admission that vernacular building has transformed over time and some of my early  
**[0:55:33-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:33):**  natural building teachers talked about how in urban environments the most natural or  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:39):**  common materials around you are actually gleaned from the waste stream and not harvested from  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:44):**  the earth or taken from you know cutting down new trees but using things like urbanite which  
**[0:55:48-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:48):**  is you know discarded pavement and the other things which tend to have quite a long lifespan  
**[0:55:55-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:55:55):**  and if we're throwing them out it's like that's a bigger waste than trying to switch entirely  
**[0:56:01-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:01):**  over to just natural materials and there's also a recognition that there is real value  
**[0:56:06-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:06):**  in these we're not going to have them forever and to use them appropriately sparingly but  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:12):**  in the correct applications is really important and not to negate that just because it's not  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:18):**  natural based on some sort of pretentious ideas of what natural is.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:23):**  Well this is of course a key theme in permaculture and I think about projects around the world  
**[0:56:30-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:30):**  yes there's sometimes good examples of ecological gardening and farming and sometimes of good  
**[0:56:38-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:38):**  ecological building but the creative reuse of what already exists is almost one of the  
**[0:56:44-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:44):**  most universal characteristics in permaculture projects and it's tapping into that aspect  
**[0:56:51-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:51):**  that there is so much waste so much available materials that people in the past didn't have  
**[0:56:59-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:56:59):**  so I remember when we were setting up my mother's property in southern New South Wales in the  
**[0:57:07-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:57:07):**  late 70s and I built used a stainless steel sink as an outside garden sink so you wash  
**[0:57:14-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:57:14):**  the veggies before you bring them and I thought why didn't everyone have this like this is  
**[0:57:20-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:57:20):**  so useful and then I thought well you know 50 years ago people might have been thankful  
**[0:57:27-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:57:27):**  to have a sink in their house whereas even by 1979 I could go to the local tip and get  
**[0:57:34-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:57:34):**  a perfectly good stainless steel sink for you know relatively few dollars and of course  
**[0:57:41-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:57:41):**  that super abundance in most countries has become sort of obscene throwaway where you  
**[0:57:48-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:57:48):**  can get these things for less than their scrap metal value so that opportunities to do things  
**[0:57:55-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:57:55):**  like making wicking beds out of what were perfectly good baths that in a sense the waste  
**[0:58:03-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:03):**  of modern society is a sort of a huge opportunity for creative reuse and that opportunity depends  
**[0:58:10-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:10):**  on skill, serendipitous and responsive design which doesn't suit corporations and large  
**[0:58:20-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:20):**  organizational structures at a very large scale but is perfectly cued to things being  
**[0:58:28-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:28):**  done at a small scale because those resource streams change and there needs to be that  
**[0:58:34-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:34):**  adaption so I think there's no shortage of resources in the world there's a shortage  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:40):**  of skills to make use of all those resources.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:45):**  And so as one of the co-originators of the permaculture concept and really pioneering  
**[0:58:50-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:50):**  the ethics portion especially I'm wondering how you apply these concepts which are often  
**[0:58:56-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:58:56):**  illustrated through natural processes and patterns to the built environment where are  
**[0:59:01-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:59:01):**  the correlations, the analogs and the yeah the conversions that people can make for what  
**[0:59:07-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:59:07):**  seems like an unnatural environment?  
**[0:59:11-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:59:11):**  Yeah well I suppose the if we think of the design principles starting with observe and  
**[0:59:19-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:59:19):**  interact which is absolutely essential for any animal that survives in the natural world  
**[0:59:26-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:59:26):**  and we need to relearn that in a sense that's unlearning, unschooling the idea that we have  
**[0:59:32-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:59:32):**  to have all this knowledge poured into our heads or told by someone else or receive some  
**[0:59:38-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:59:38):**  expertise that we can't observe and interact and what we find with any house even one that

**[0:59:54-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=0:59:54):**  and the patterns of that are not very complicated but they involve the person interacting with  
**[1:00:02-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:00:02):**  the built environment rather than just switching on the air conditioner or switching on the

**[1:00:20-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:00:20):**  So we can think of that and if we look at passive solar design itself as an example  
**[1:00:26-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:00:26):**  of the principle of catch and store energy the principle itself we see in nature everywhere  
**[1:00:33-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:00:33):**  because energy and all useful resources are not seamlessly available in an on-demand way  
**[1:00:44-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:00:44):**  you know sunlight comes during the daytime and comes during the warm seasons and not

**[1:00:59-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:00:59):**  through photosynthesis and storing it in carbohydrate in wood in in structure which is then used

**[1:01:48-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:01:48):**  So the built environment reflects those same principles or should reflect those same principles  
**[1:01:54-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:01:54):**  and again storing water in rain water tanks for periods when water is not available rather

**[1:02:11-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:02:11):**  would be nice but you know and the substitute for that is of course town water which just

**[1:02:24-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:02:24):**  Well I think it's wonderful that you mentioned that because I'm very fortunate in the the

**[1:02:37-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:02:37):**  Well this is one of the reasons I came to the conclusion I thought why in the Mediterranean  
**[1:02:43-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:02:43):**  in so many places are there not these sophisticated water harvesting and storage systems that

**[1:03:09-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:03:09):**  and so what we find historically is where resources are abundant or the environment  
**[1:03:17-1:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:03:17):**  is relatively benign people don't develop very sophisticated solutions or design solutions

**[1:07:40-1:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:07:40):**  I'd like to pivot for a second here and ask you some of the questions that I've actually  
**[1:07:43-1:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:07:43):**  been saving up and wanting to ask you for a long time if you'll indulge me so yeah you've  
**[1:07:50-1:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:07:50):**  been at the center of the permaculture movement really since it began and have been instrumental  
**[1:07:54-1:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:07:54):**  in its conception and I'm wondering how do you feel about the way that it has evolved  
**[1:07:58-1:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:07:58):**  over time do you feel that it still represents the origins and the intentions that you and  
**[1:08:03-1:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:08:03):**  Bill had at the inception or has it really strayed and morphed into something that you  
**[1:08:08-1:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:08:08):**  couldn't have seen from back then well I think it has evolved and morphed enormously and  
**[1:08:17-1:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:08:17):**  I think both Bill and myself sort of contributed to that but it was it was largely a result  
**[1:08:26-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:08:26):**  of it becoming a worldwide movement really initially through Bill's brilliance in crafting  
**[1:08:36-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:08:36):**  the permaculture design course as a mechanism for extending the ideas more than would have  
**[1:08:43-1:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:08:43):**  happened just with books and the occasional lecture or demonstration site so I think that  
**[1:08:55-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:08:55):**  has meant it's interacted with other movements and ideas contemporaneous ideas and been enormously  
**[1:09:03-1:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:09:03):**  strengthened by that process but you can also see how make the critique that for example  
**[1:09:13-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:09:13):**  the recognition that was at the core of permaculture that the problem of agriculture the most important  
**[1:09:21-1:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:09:21):**  activity on the planet by which we provide our food that we need to do every year whereas  
**[1:09:30-1:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:09:30):**  you know to some extent we probably have enough buildings on the planet learn to use them  
**[1:09:36-1:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:09:36):**  properly and look after them whereas we have to grow food every year and the enormous destruction  
**[1:09:43-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:09:43):**  that that represented especially in the modern forms and recognizing that a lot of that was  
**[1:09:48-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:09:48):**  our over dependence on annual plants and the huge potential for perennial plants and trees  
**[1:09:55-1:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:09:55):**  as tree crops to have a greater role in making agriculture more ecological sustainable and  
**[1:10:03-1:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:03):**  also still very productive and that we didn't keep that focus in permaculture just on that  
**[1:10:11-1:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:11):**  problem which itself is a multi-generational problem and that permaculture sort of morphed  
**[1:10:19-1:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:19):**  and became a theory of everything in a way a sort of design solutions to the world and  
**[1:10:27-1:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:27):**  the critique can be made of where are the examples where permaculture is contributed  
**[1:10:33-1:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:33):**  to that original great vision and you can see work of people like Mark Shepherd within  
**[1:10:40-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:40):**  permaculture as you know an example of the expression of that but of course some of that  
**[1:10:45-1:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:45):**  work is sort of also built on people who were quite outside the permaculture movement who  
**[1:10:51-1:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:51):**  at a similar time focused their whole lives on this research that of course governments  
**[1:10:59-1:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:10:59):**  weren't interested in doing is how do we make the potential of tree crops into something  
**[1:11:06-1:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:11:06):**  that can rival corn, soybeans, grains in providing the staple basics of the world.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:11:18):**  So I think mostly that broadening out of the scope of permaculture design has been a positive  
**[1:11:27-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:11:27):**  thing and it's allowed a lot more people to relate to the thinking behind permaculture  
**[1:11:33-1:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:11:33):**  because they've been able to do it whether it's through intentional communities or ecological  
**[1:11:39-1:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:11:39):**  building or complementary approaches to health and many sort of other fields I think that's  
**[1:11:51-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:11:51):**  been largely positive but I also see there's you know some blind spots that have developed  
**[1:12:00-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:12:00):**  in adopting some extreme expressions of contemporaneous ideas that have strayed away from what I'd  
**[1:12:14-1:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:12:14):**  see as underlying values especially around the notions of disadvantage and disability  
**[1:12:27-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:12:27):**  and identity politics that although those things are real in the same way that class  
**[1:12:35-1:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:12:35):**  and those differences of power are immense realities that must be recognized and dealt  
**[1:12:42-1:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:12:42):**  with permaculture has always been about creating the world we do want and looking at where  
**[1:12:50-1:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:12:50):**  are the opportunities to improve something rather than focusing constantly on all the  
**[1:12:58-1:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:12:58):**  things that are stopping us becoming something better or doing something better because that  
**[1:13:05-1:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:13:05):**  projection that those are the things and that they have to change before we can be enabled  
**[1:13:13-1:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:13:13):**  I don't think actually even help the most disadvantaged disempowered people because  
**[1:13:21-1:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:13:21):**  they further accelerate that sense that we can't do anything and it's this oppression  
**[1:13:27-1:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:13:27):**  of whatever class of people or system that is doing it to us so breaking out of that  
**[1:13:34-1:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:13:34):**  and even if it's an illusion even if we are incredibly oppressed to never give that oppression  
**[1:13:45-1:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:13:45):**  the power over us and rather than stridently objecting to it it's in a sense almost like  
**[1:13:55-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:13:55):**  studiously ignoring it so I think I do have some concerns about where the elements of  
**[1:14:04-1:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:14:04):**  social justice, elements of disability and the rights culture haven't always contributed  
**[1:14:16-1:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:14:16):**  to positive directions even though of course my own political and historical lineage on  
**[1:14:27-1:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:14:27):**  the left has always recognised those things as yes this is part of the world in which  
**[1:14:34-1:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:14:34):**  we work and we seek to change in whatever way we can but I suppose as one of the founders  
**[1:14:42-1:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:14:42):**  it's inevitable that one becomes to some extent discontented at some aspects of the way permaculture  
**[1:14:56-1:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:14:56):**  has been expressed but mostly I am just incredibly grateful for all the energy and amazing creativity  
**[1:15:04-1:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:04):**  that people have done with these ideas and made it what it is.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:13):**  Let's explore into that a little bit deeper and I think you stated that really tactfully  
**[1:15:16-1:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:16):**  I could see some of the examples that you were referencing without having to mention  
**[1:15:22-1:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:22):**  and I'm wondering on the other side of it what are some of the emergencies and the evolutions  
**[1:15:29-1:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:29):**  that have come from permaculture and you know environmental learning and teaching from other  
**[1:15:35-1:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:35):**  parts of the world that have inspired your own work and helped to bring it to heights  
**[1:15:40-1:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:40):**  that perhaps you couldn't imagine from before?  
**[1:15:44-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:44):**  Well I think the ongoing recognition and deepening of the understanding of indigenous wisdom  
**[1:15:52-1:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:15:52):**  which was there at the beginning in the discussions between myself and Molosson about new then  
**[1:16:01-1:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:16:01):**  new concepts in the scientific literature like the recognition of Aboriginal management  
**[1:16:08-1:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:16:08):**  of Australia was in fact fire stick farming which you know in the 1970s which it's very  
**[1:16:15-1:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:16:15):**  recently those ideas have finally sort of come to the fore and we're now reevaluating  
**[1:16:21-1:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:16:21):**  Australia as perhaps the oldest cultural landscape actually in the world continuously husbanded  
**[1:16:29-1:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:16:29):**  landscape in the world rather than it being a wilderness in that sense with a few people  
**[1:16:36-1:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:16:36):**  wandering around and the deepening and rediscovery of that knowledge I think is an ongoing thing  
**[1:16:46-1:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:16:46):**  not just in Australia and in other parts of the world.  
**[1:16:54-1:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:16:54):**  You know I think the also the way in which permaculture has been adopted and adapted  
**[1:17:07-1:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:17:07):**  in many different cultures and societies especially in the two-thirds world you know we associate  
**[1:17:17-1:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:17:17):**  permaculture by default with the places where there's websites and sort of projects and  
**[1:17:24-1:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:17:24):**  in the affluent world but a huge amount of permaculture has been really reinforcing a  
**[1:17:33-1:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:17:33):**  lot of traditional knowledge that people are recovering in other places and that combination  
**[1:17:43-1:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:17:43):**  of simple modern technologies from the outside like a tin roof and a water tank being a transformative  
**[1:17:51-1:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:17:51):**  technology in many parts of the world that does come that permaculture often introduces  
**[1:18:02-1:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:18:02):**  to a place combined with this rediscovery and revaluing of tradition and I remember  
**[1:18:13-1:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:18:13):**  an experience in Israel in 94 despite having sort of really very little experience outside  
**[1:18:23-1:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:18:23):**  the affluent world I was asked to sort of give a presentation showing our house and  
**[1:18:30-1:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:18:30):**  property to a community of Bedouins and I thought gee what can I show them that is of  
**[1:18:37-1:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:18:37):**  any relevant and of course I was introduced as famous ecologist from Australia and anyway  
**[1:18:42-1:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:18:42):**  I'm showing photos of our house and there's this old man getting up at the back and gesticulating  
**[1:18:49-1:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:18:49):**  and pointing excitedly to the house and the building we were in was actually made of concrete  
**[1:18:54-1:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:18:54):**  block and he's I said what's he saying he's saying it's a Bedouin house it's a Bedouin  
**[1:19:01-1:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:01):**  house because he recognized the Adobe and so if you know a world famous ecologist from  
**[1:19:10-1:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:10):**  Australia presumably rich could live in things that this is our stuff we can revalue that  
**[1:19:19-1:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:19):**  so that way in which permaculture has contributed to that just recognition and valuing of things  
**[1:19:27-1:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:27):**  that the modern world was really displacing or discounting.  
**[1:19:33-1:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:33):**  Yeah for sure and as your work as an educator and a mentor I'm sure has evolved over this  
**[1:19:40-1:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:40):**  time as well have you noticed a change in the level of awareness and skill set or general  
**[1:19:48-1:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:48):**  competence when it comes to understanding of natural patterns that your students come  
**[1:19:52-1:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:52):**  to you with has that changed a lot over the years?  
**[1:19:55-1:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:19:55):**  I definitely you know I can remember discussions with permaculture teachers about the limitations  
**[1:20:02-1:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:02):**  of some of my own criticisms of permaculture teaching as it sort of rolled out in the 80s  
**[1:20:10-1:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:10):**  and 90s and you know people would talk about the sort of improvements about teaching methods  
**[1:20:16-1:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:16):**  and knowledge of people teaching and I'd say yeah but the people who are coming to courses  
**[1:20:22-1:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:22):**  are also so much better informed and that is so much clearer now that many young people  
**[1:20:30-1:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:30):**  are much better informed and not just from reading books or doing courses or watching  
**[1:20:35-1:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:35):**  something on YouTube but there's the sort of generational learning of oh yeah I know  
**[1:20:41-1:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:41):**  so and so's family who went and did this or that in a self-reliance way and yeah they  
**[1:20:47-1:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:47):**  ran into these issues or you know there's the learning from past mistakes that sort  
**[1:20:53-1:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:20:53):**  of osmotically developed and I can remember when I first came to live in this community  
**[1:21:01-1:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:21:01):**  where I do now 35 years ago I sort of didn't really meet many people who knew about edible  
**[1:21:10-1:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:21:10):**  mushrooms beyond field mushrooms and I thought I was pretty knowledgeable because I sort  
**[1:21:16-1:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:21:16):**  of knew half a dozen that I could go out and collect well you know over the decades we've  
**[1:21:22-1:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:21:22):**  had people who are incredible experts and then people who are growing mushrooms people  
**[1:21:28-1:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:21:28):**  who are sharing the property with us here Nick Ritter and Kirsten Bradley of Milkwood  
**[1:21:35-1:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:21:35):**  Permaculture, Nick's a mushroom growing aficionado and all of you know the incredible knowledge  
**[1:21:44-1:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:21:44):**  that there is about and a lot of work which has been developed as vernacular just do-it-yourself  
**[1:21:52-1:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:21:52):**  experimentation and then passing that on so you know now in this community there's half  
**[1:22:01-1:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:01):**  a dozen people I could go to who are completely expert in mushrooms way above any knowledge  
**[1:22:08-1:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:08):**  I have been in that area so I mean that's just an example of the sort of changes and  
**[1:22:17-1:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:17):**  you know learning that's been happening.  
**[1:22:19-1:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:19):**  I think that's a perfect example though because I mean it's been only just a handful of years  
**[1:22:24-1:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:24):**  now where mycology as a science has absolutely exploded and you start to see the emergence  
**[1:22:29-1:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:29):**  of citizen science projects and the ability to grow and cultivate and identify and even  
**[1:22:35-1:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:35):**  genetically map things that we had no access to five or ten years ago has been amazing  
**[1:22:41-1:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:41):**  and the explosion of understanding of soil science is another one especially in the agricultural  
**[1:22:48-1:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:48):**  realm has come so far in just a very short time and all of that is contributing to this  
**[1:22:54-1:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:54):**  body of knowledge that people have easier access to than ever I think we're in extremely  
**[1:22:59-1:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:22:59):**  exciting times and then I think as well the permaculture lens offers a context and a wisdom  
**[1:23:06-1:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:06):**  to the application of that knowledge so that it isn't manipulated necessarily for linear  
**[1:23:11-1:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:11):**  and industrial ends but can be integrated into a wiser and more complex understanding  
**[1:23:19-1:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:19):**  of the patterns in nature that help to inform appropriate applications and uses of this  
**[1:23:24-1:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:24):**  new understanding.  
**[1:23:26-1:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:26):**  I think it's a very exciting time to have access to all of this.  
**[1:23:32-1:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:32):**  Definitely and just to return to the slight black hat aspect I wrote an essay recently  
**[1:23:40-1:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:40):**  that people can read on my website about how the solution turns back into the problem because  
**[1:23:47-1:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:47):**  of course this permaculture aphorism that the problem is the solution or at least the  
**[1:23:52-1:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:52):**  problem is the relation.  
**[1:23:53-1:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:53):**  Possibly the most overused one there is.  
**[1:23:57-1:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:23:57):**  Yeah but the reality so often is that when we make two steps forward and we find some  
**[1:24:06-1:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:24:06):**  new ecological solution or rediscover something and then it's captured by corporate mentality  
**[1:24:16-1:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:24:16):**  scaled up and turned back into the same old problem again.  
**[1:24:21-1:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:24:21):**  I mean we can think of plants, incredible tree crops in the world like palm oil, tropical  
**[1:24:27-1:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:24:27):**  palm oil, amazing tree will grow on very poor soils, incredibly productive of oil but it's  
**[1:24:35-1:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:24:35):**  been turned into this complete disaster of these vast monocultural plantations replacing  
**[1:24:41-1:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:24:41):**  forest and wetland and then yeah giving a terrible name to the plant which is actually  
**[1:24:50-1:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:24:50):**  a really useful tree as part of a mixed savannah tropical polycultural system.  
**[1:25:02-1:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:02):**  And you know I think that what Vandana Shiva calls the monoculture of mind is more the  
**[1:25:11-1:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:11):**  problem than the monoculture itself.  
**[1:25:14-1:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:14):**  So that is constantly the power of permaculture to bring us back to that ethics and design  
**[1:25:23-1:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:23):**  principles to sort of overcome the inherited dysfunction of limits of industrial modernity  
**[1:25:34-1:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:34):**  that is always looking for the single big fix.  
**[1:25:38-1:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:38):**  Every problem there must be one big solution that fixes everything.  
**[1:25:43-1:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:43):**  Well actually that might have been part of the way the world was when fossil fuel seemed  
**[1:25:49-1:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:49):**  to sort of do everything but sorry the future is not going to be like that.  
**[1:25:54-1:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:25:54):**  It's going to be a future of diverse solutions and context specific solutions and the more  
**[1:26:00-1:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:00):**  you try and focus on there being one answer the more you create the problems again.  
**[1:26:07-1:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:07):**  So that essay sort of goes through a lot of those things because it's not just sort of  
**[1:26:12-1:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:12):**  evil or stupid people in corporations.  
**[1:26:15-1:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:15):**  These are deep sort of cultural patterns that in many cases we're actually trying to overturn  
**[1:26:22-1:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:22):**  or unlearn.  
**[1:26:24-1:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:24):**  Yeah that's such a relevant issue for my own work right now in a startup that is trying  
**[1:26:31-1:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:31):**  to scale the infrastructure for regenerative agriculture in Europe and almost by definition  
**[1:26:37-1:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:37):**  of that ambition we're missing some of the nuance in what is required for well regenerative  
**[1:26:44-1:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:44):**  agriculture to be actually regenerative.  
**[1:26:47-1:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:47):**  If we start to homogenize the solutions and start to roll it out without taking in the  
**[1:26:52-1:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:52):**  nuance of the context of its applications, the lives that it affects, the communities  
**[1:26:58-1:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:26:58):**  that it interacts with, then scale is not a solution at that point and it's that same  
**[1:27:04-1:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:27:04):**  way for so many of these applications like you said once you have a solution the wisdom  
**[1:27:09-1:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:27:09):**  and the ethics are required to actually solve things with it.  
**[1:27:16-1:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:27:16):**  And that's actually one of the reasons that I didn't mention about my focus on retro suburbia  
**[1:27:21-1:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:27:21):**  because we do know that it's a limited number of people who can creatively work from ethics  
**[1:27:29-1:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:27:29):**  and principles and design process and patterns to getting refined effective design solutions.  
**[1:27:38-1:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:27:38):**  Most people work by there's something that works I'll copy that and in suburban landscapes  
**[1:27:46-1:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:27:46):**  often there's a replication of soils of building types of things that to a certain degree the  
**[1:27:54-1:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:27:54):**  copy solution yet that works there I can copy that is actually possible.  
**[1:28:02-1:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:28:02):**  So we can get a scaling by viral replication not quite in the way we can in the sort of  
**[1:28:09-1:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:28:09):**  online virtual world and yes the soil can be just a little bit different just down the  
**[1:28:18-1:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:28:18):**  street a bit and everything is a bit different but it's not quite as the extreme complexity  
**[1:28:26-1:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:28:26):**  of large scale agriculture in complex landscapes where the history of the land the people and  
**[1:28:38-1:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:28:38):**  what has been done and the systems are all inevitably sort of unique.  
**[1:28:46-1:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:28:46):**  So I think it's no accident that the first industry to be industrialized was textile manufacture  
**[1:28:56-1:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:28:56):**  and it were huge improvements in productivity as a result of that and the patterns were  
**[1:29:03-1:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:03):**  basically replicable across the world.  
**[1:29:05-1:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:05):**  The last important industry to be industrialized was actually agriculture.  
**[1:29:11-1:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:11):**  A lot of it only in the mid 20th century because it's so site and situation specific everything  
**[1:29:18-1:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:18):**  is not as amenable to the sort of industrial agricultural extension system here's the proven  
**[1:29:29-1:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:29):**  pattern and just copy this and understanding that the agricultural practitioner the innovator  
**[1:29:37-1:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:37):**  is an integral part of the landscape and the production system that what they do and who  
**[1:29:45-1:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:45):**  they are is very much part of it.  
**[1:29:48-1:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:48):**  It doesn't mean to say we can't do things at large scale and it doesn't mean that we  
**[1:29:53-1:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:29:53):**  can't copy elements and patterns from one place and situation to another but we can  
**[1:30:04-1:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:04):**  make big mistakes if we think there's a set pattern that can be done everywhere.  
**[1:30:10-1:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:10):**  Yeah, yeah, very well said.  
**[1:30:12-1:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:12):**  Now I along these lines know that you focus so much on the observation the data gathering  
**[1:30:19-1:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:19):**  and the understanding part before working into design and applications of things and  
**[1:30:24-1:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:24):**  as I understand you've got a documentary coming out fairly soon about pattern understanding  
**[1:30:30-1:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:30):**  and observing reading landscapes with Dan Palmer.  
**[1:30:33-1:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:33):**  Can you tell me a bit about that?  
**[1:30:35-1:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:35):**  Yeah well it's been a passion for me reading landscape from the early days of when I worked  
**[1:30:43-1:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:43):**  in New Zealand shortly after working with Bill Mollison with colleague Kakaetane who  
**[1:30:49-1:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:49):**  I regard as in a lot of ways my second mentor in permaculture when we were setting up permaculture  
**[1:30:57-1:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:30:57):**  in New Zealand in 1979 and I just realized this the path I'd already been on of observing  
**[1:31:07-1:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:07):**  things and learning from direct observation rather than just receive knowledge or having  
**[1:31:14-1:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:14):**  been in a place for long enough to say yes I remember when that happened.  
**[1:31:20-1:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:20):**  So to be able to see the signs in the landscape and it became for me this is the core skill  
**[1:31:27-1:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:27):**  for a permaculture designer especially in the fields where I was working where most  
**[1:31:32-1:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:32):**  of the work was one day on-site advisory work for people doing the back to the land thing  
**[1:31:39-1:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:39):**  and could I sort of intervene where should house sites be where should the basic land  
**[1:31:46-1:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:46):**  allocation dams for water supply and there wasn't complex databases of information the  
**[1:31:54-1:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:54):**  people were new to the land.  
**[1:31:56-1:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:31:56):**  There's often not other reference points and you've got to digest a lot of observation  
**[1:32:03-1:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:32:03):**  very quickly and deliver that to people which is really a contradiction of the need to slowly  
**[1:32:11-1:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:32:11):**  observe something over a long period.  
**[1:32:14-1:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:32:14):**  So that was a sort of a core skill and then I went on to sort of try and how do we teach  
**[1:32:22-1:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:32:22):**  this you know how did I learn it and to some extent that's a very difficult problem because  
**[1:32:31-1:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:32:31):**  and working with Dan Palmer in more recent years he identified he observed me reading  
**[1:32:38-1:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:32:38):**  the landscape and started to feed back to me some things that oh right okay yeah and  
**[1:32:46-1:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:32:46):**  that that accelerated this whole interest in communicating those skills and that was  
**[1:32:53-1:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:32:53):**  the beginning of this project which has led to a documentary mostly shot in in central  
**[1:33:03-1:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:33:03):**  Victoria reading landscapes from the backyard scale to the broadacre scale and where we've  
**[1:33:11-1:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:33:11):**  got most of the footage so there's there's there's talk about you know further elements  
**[1:33:19-1:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:33:19):**  before before the films really some really excited at and see it very much in the context  
**[1:33:28-1:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:33:28):**  of course of the work Dan Palmer has contributed through his making permaculture stronger blog  
**[1:33:36-1:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:33:36):**  in a book he's working on on design process because I still think permaculture design

**[1:33:49-1:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:33:49):**  but the design professions generally and how does this actually work how do we design and  
**[1:33:55-1:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:33:55):**  how do we how do our design methods actually reflect nature's self-organized design processes  
**[1:34:04-1:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:34:04):**  rather than a mechanical assembly line industrial model and of course there's references to  
**[1:34:14-1:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:34:14):**  that through back to the work of Alexander and others through the pattern language ideas  
**[1:34:23-1:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:34:23):**  and of course that's part of what we've tried to do with retro suburbia that that a lot  
**[1:34:30-1:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:34:30):**  of the book is actually written it was really as these repeating patterns that are refined  
**[1:34:39-1:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:34:39):**  solutions to recurring dilemmas that are that occur in in any design process and that not  
**[1:34:49-1:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:34:49):**  that those are sort of building blocks that can be assembled into our whole design but  
**[1:34:57-1:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:34:57):**  they that pattern understanding can help us start with what we have and begin to differentiate

**[1:35:11-1:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:35:11):**  a deep understanding that we have to recognize that every place is already a whole place  
**[1:35:19-1:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:35:19):**  before we do anything with it it has a history and a lineage that we need to unearth in a  
**[1:35:28-1:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:35:28):**  sense through almost like archaeology and that's also part of the acknowledgement of  
**[1:35:35-1:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:35:35):**  the power of place and culture and people that have inhabited that place before so it's  
**[1:35:42-1:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:35:42):**  part of that sort of indigenous and vernacular traditional knowledge of respect for country  
**[1:35:51-1:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:35:51):**  and thinking of it as alive and carrying all the spirits of the past because it literally  
**[1:35:58-1:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-holmrgren-on-the-hidden-regeneration-potential-of-the-suburbs/#t=1:35:58):**  does have all those things all the things that have happened in the past whether it's

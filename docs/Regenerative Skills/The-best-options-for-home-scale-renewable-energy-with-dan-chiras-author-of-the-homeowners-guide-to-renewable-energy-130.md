### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:00:59):**  We're now well into this ongoing series on natural building and design, and we've  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:20):**  covered bamboo building, rocket stoves, design at the building and community levels, and  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:25):**  so much more already.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:27):**  One of the biggest topics that I haven't yet explored on this podcast, and has always  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:30):**  interested me, is the subject of renewable energy.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:35):**  Renewables have been in the media for a long time, both branded as a solution to our collective  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:39):**  reliance on fossil fuel energy, and also criticized for being too expensive for people to install  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:44):**  or implement at the home scale.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:46):**  Luckily, I had the chance to speak with Dan Cheris, the author of many books on renewable  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:51):**  energy and other regenerative living skills, including Power from the Sun, Power from the  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:01:56):**  Wind, Solar Energy Basics, Solar Home Heating Basics, The Homeowner's Guide to Renewable  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:02):**  Energy, Solar Electricity Basics, and many more.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:06):**  The best part about Dan's knowledge is that he has implemented the systems that he writes  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:10):**  about for himself, and can speak from experience about living long term with solar and wind  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:14):**  energy systems, as well as the maintenance and repair costs over time.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:19):**  In this interview, Dan goes into detail about all the practical differences in solar, wind,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:24):**  and other renewable energy systems.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:26):**  He walks me through the process of examining the potential of each resource, calculating  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:31):**  the size of the system based on your consumption, and more.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:34):**  We also talk about the advantages of grid connected vs fully off grid systems, as well  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:39):**  as hybrid options.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:41):**  Dan also gives great advice to homeowners considering renewable energy installations,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:46):**  and even how to look into tax incentives and cooperative buying schemes to reduce the initial  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:51):**  upfront cost of installing a system.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:53):**  I've also included links to all of Dan's books on renewable energy for anyone looking to  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:02:58):**  get a more in depth understanding of a particular application, so be sure to check out the resource  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:03):**  section on the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:05):**  But before I ramble on too much, I'll hand things over now to Dan.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:09):**  Hey Dan, thanks so much for taking the time to be with me today, how are you doing?  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:14):**  I'm doing well, thank you.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:15):**  It's a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:17):**  Hey, the pleasure's all mine now.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:19):**  I am really excited to talk to you about the whole myriad of things that you've written  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:23):**  about with New Society, but we're going to focus a little bit today on renewable energy  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:28):**  for home based use.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:30):**  So what do you say we just jump into the questions?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:33):**  Sounds good.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:34):**  Alright, so you've written a number of books with New Society covering a range of topics  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:40):**  from renewable energy, green transport, parenting natural plasters, creating sustainable neighborhoods,  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:46):**  and a whole bunch more.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:48):**  That's a really overarching reach there.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:52):**  What is sort of the world view that informs these topics and how did you get interested  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:57):**  in all this stuff?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:03:58):**  I've always been interested in the big picture.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:01):**  You know, I have a PhD and that always drove me crazy to be so narrowly focused on one  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:07):**  little thing, you know, through my research, just one little tiny, tiny thing.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:12):**  My mind is just interested in the whole, the totality.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:16):**  I wrote an environmental science textbook years ago, and each chapter was its own little  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:22):**  universe.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:23):**  You know, the chapter on air pollution was, here's what air pollution is, here's how you  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:28):**  solve it, then water pollution, here's water pollution, here's how you solve it.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:32):**  And I just got to thinking, you know, we're not looking at underlying causes and root  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:37):**  level solutions.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:38):**  And that's what got me into the big picture is to really start thinking about big, big  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:44):**  things, you know, and how all this fits together.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:47):**  And so that's kind of why I've spun out so many ideas.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:51):**  It's all part of this big picture for creating a sustainable future.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:04:56):**  And have you implemented a lot of these things that you've written about in your own life?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:00):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:01):**  I've been doing it for years, years and years and years.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:04):**  All right, so let's start from the beginning then.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:08):**  Let's talk a little bit about the benefits and the potential of installing a renewable  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:13):**  energy system.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:14):**  Okay.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:15):**  All right.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:16):**  Now, there's a lot of different types of renewable energy systems.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:20):**  In many cases, one of the main benefits besides producing cleaner power, much cleaner power,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:28):**  and creating more self-sufficiency, and those are pretty big ones by themselves.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:33):**  We could just end the conversation there.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:36):**  In most cases, what's really shocking is it's a lot cheaper than going the conventional  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:40):**  route.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:41):**  And this is, unfortunately, there's a stigma with renewables.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:47):**  Most people think, oh, I can't afford renewables, they're too expensive.  
**[0:05:50-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:05:50):**  And the fact of the matter is, many forms of renewable energy systems, I should say,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:00):**  are actually cheaper than going the standard route.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:04):**  Just take one example, very, very briefly, solar electricity.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:09):**  Everybody looks at that and goes, oh, man, that's just so expensive.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:12):**  The fact is, when you install a solar electric system, you're now producing electricity about  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:19):**  anywhere from four to six cents a kilowatt hour.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:22):**  Now, most of us are paying between eight and 20 cents a kilowatt hour.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:28):**  And here's the rub, is that solar appears expensive because you're solar electricity  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:33):**  because you have to purchase the technology upfront.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:36):**  You're basically prepaying your electric bill for the next 30 years.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:41):**  So on face value, it says, wow, that's a lot of money.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:45):**  But the fact of the matter is, it's a lot cheaper than just buying utility power for  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:49):**  the next 30 years, month after month after month, much, much cheaper.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:06:54):**  So that's one of the huge benefits is cost effectiveness, cleaner planet, self-sufficiency.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:00):**  So those are three of the big ones.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:02):**  And then there's some bragging rights, too.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:04):**  Many of us like to just say, hey, I'm powered entirely by wind and solar.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:08):**  Yeah, and I mean, think about the sense of security you must feel knowing that you're  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:13):**  not tied to the grid and all the things that can go wrong with those larger systems.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:17):**  You have at least a little bit of redundancy if you're still connected through other means  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:22):**  as well.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:24):**  Now, one thing that we need to be really clear about is if I install the solar electric system  
**[0:07:28-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:28):**  on my home and most people still connect to the grid, and what that allows them to do  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:36):**  is to store any surplus they generate during the day for use at night or use during the  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:42):**  next day.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:43):**  So 99.9% of the systems, like mine, we are still actually grid connected.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:51):**  And here's the rub, is if the grid goes down, so does my system.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:07:54):**  My system is designed so it won't back feed electricity onto a dead grid, which could  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:00):**  be very, very damaging to line workers.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:04):**  To truly be independent, you need to install batteries.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:08):**  We don't do that very much.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:09):**  Batteries are pretty expensive.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:11):**  There is a lot of maintenance involved.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:13):**  They don't have a very long lifespan.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:15):**  I've lived off grid for many years in Colorado.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:18):**  I mean, I've done it.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:19):**  I've lived 14 years off grid in Colorado and battery banks are pretty challenging.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:24):**  So one of the things that we have to let people understand is that in most cases, if you install  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:29):**  wind or solar and you're grid tied, you really are vulnerable to the grid.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:35):**  You really are vulnerable to breakdowns, brownouts or blackouts that occur in the grid.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:41):**  That said, there are some ways around that.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:43):**  There's some interesting technologies that some manufacturers are producing, devices  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:49):**  that will allow you to still connect to your solar system even though the grid goes down.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:55):**  So there's some ways around it, but they're not very widely implemented.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:08:59):**  Okay.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:00):**  Well, let's break down some of the advantages and disadvantages of those systems now.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:05):**  So there's the entirely off grid ones.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:08):**  There are those that are still connected to the grid.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:11):**  And I know that this differs in different parts of the world or even in different parts  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:15):**  of the same countries is the ability to sell the electricity back and either get a rebate  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:21):**  or credit system from the utilities.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:25):**  Where have you seen the most success or adoption and what are the advantages of each type of  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:31):**  system?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:32):**  Okay, so let's start with systems first.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:34):**  Grid tied is the least expensive.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:38):**  It's the simplest to install and the most reliable.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:42):**  There are just not many moving parts.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:44):**  Again, there's an inverter and solar modules and that's about it.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:47):**  So that's the big advantage of grid type.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:50):**  Cheapest, least expensive, easiest to install and real easy to maintain and very, very,  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:57):**  very, very reliable.  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:58):**  Okay.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:09:59):**  So that's number one.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:01):**  Then we can have grid connected with battery backup.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:04):**  Now that's a system that produces all your electricity, but it has a small battery bank.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:12):**  Usually just six or eight batteries that are in your basement or someplace safe that are  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:20):**  always full of electricity.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:22):**  Their job is simply to wait for the grid to go down.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:26):**  And if the grid goes down for 10 minutes or 10 hours or 10 days, your system essentially  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:33):**  converts to an off-grid system.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:35):**  So you now start operating off your solar or wind system with your battery backup.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:40):**  So you become autonomous.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:42):**  Now they're more expensive than grid tied.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:48):**  More common.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:49):**  More expensive?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:50):**  Yeah, mostly.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:51):**  And there are more components.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:53):**  There's a charge controller device called the charge controller that needs to be installed.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:10:58):**  Special type of inverter.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:00):**  The problem, and I love these systems, the problem with these systems is that in most  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:05):**  places electricity is pretty reliable.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:07):**  So you very, very rarely need your battery backup.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:12):**  As a consequence, most people forget they even exist.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:17):**  They might go eight or 10 years without watering their batteries.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:21):**  And I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I did it just recently.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:25):**  I forgot to water my batteries for a couple of years.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:28):**  We just don't have power outages where we live.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:33):**  And I went to check the batteries and they were bone dry.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:36):**  So that is a disadvantage.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:38):**  Out of sight, out of mind, those batteries need to be maintained.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:43):**  If you do that, then you've got power when the grid goes down.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:48):**  Not as much as you used to have because we typically in these systems install a smaller  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:53):**  battery bank.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:54):**  It's just for backup loads or most important, not backup, but critical loads.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:11:59):**  So things that we absolutely must have, like big screen TV.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:04):**  They're really important stuff in our lives.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:07):**  No, but refrigerators, freezers, well pumps, that kind of thing.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:11):**  And so the third system is battery based.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:14):**  These are the most complicated.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:16):**  I think they're actually a little less complicated than grid tied with battery backup, but they're  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:20):**  pretty complicated.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:23):**  Much more expensive than a grid tied system, but they deliver a complete autonomy.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:29):**  You basically become your own power producer and you become the only customer.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:34):**  So you're the utility and you're the consumer.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:38):**  And they're designed primarily for people that live kind of far away from a power line.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:45):**  If you live more than two tenths of a mile or so from a power line, it's often cheaper  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:51):**  just to go ahead and install an off-grid system, a battery based off-grid system, than to connect  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:12:58):**  to the utility power because it can cost you quite a lot of money.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:02):**  I had a customer in Colorado when I lived there and they lived a mile away from the  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:10):**  utility lines and the utility charged them $65,000 just to bring power to these two little  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:17):**  tiny cabins.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:18):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:19):**  And they're little tiny cabins.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:21):**  I could have got them a lot of solar for $65,000.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:25):**  Believe me, I could have got 10 systems for those cabins.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:29):**  So that's where they really come in handy.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:32):**  Off-grid systems are popular in Canada because the country's much bigger and they're not  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:36):**  necessarily, people aren't always connected to the grid.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:41):**  Off-grid systems are popular in less developed countries where there isn't a reliable grid.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:46):**  They are more expensive and there is battery maintenance.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:50):**  We really need to maintain those batteries every month to check the water level.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:55):**  And if it drops down, fill it with distilled water.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:13:58):**  So that's kind of the main pros and cons.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:01):**  I hope that helps.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:02):**  There's a lot there to think about.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:04):**  Most people go grid-tight because it's the simplest kind of system.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:10):**  Now, do you have much experience with different types of batteries?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:13):**  I know you're mostly referring to lead acid batteries, the same ones that most people  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:18):**  are familiar having in their car, right?  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:20):**  And I know that there are also types that don't need to be watered.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:23):**  At least I've come across them.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:25):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:26):**  Does that make much of a difference in the maintenance costs of keeping those things  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:31):**  running?  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:32):**  I think that it's not costly to maintain them.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:35):**  It's just time consuming.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:37):**  And my understanding, I've never worked with any other batteries like the lithium batteries  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:42):**  that Tesla now makes a lithium battery.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:45):**  And there are other companies that make them as well.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:48):**  These are actually much better batteries for solar electric systems.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:53):**  For one, you can deep discharge them more easily without damaging them.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:14:58):**  They probably have a little bit longer lifespan.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:01):**  There's no maintenance whatsoever.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:04):**  But when I run the calculations on them, they're kind of expensive.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:08):**  They're going to pay.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:09):**  Yeah, they're quite a bit more expensive.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:10):**  Yeah, they're quite a bit more, maybe twice, maybe even three times more expensive than  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:15):**  lead acid.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:16):**  So we got to get that price down, but that's definitely something to look into.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:21):**  Have you looked at all into saltwater battery banks?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:23):**  I have not.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:24):**  I have not.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:25):**  OK.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:26):**  I haven't met anybody who's installed one of these systems, but I started doing some  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:30):**  research on this myself a little while ago.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:32):**  It seems promising.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:33):**  There's like any other type of battery technology at the moment, there are drawbacks.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:39):**  But it seems to be somewhat of an improvement on the lead acid.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:42):**  So if anybody out there is listening and has experience with the saltwater batteries, please  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:46):**  get in touch with me.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:47):**  I'd love to know more.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:50):**  What are some of the other maintenance costs and things to consider in the lifespan of  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:53):**  an off-grid system, or let's say a home scale renewable energy system?  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:15:58):**  Well, you know, the grid type, there's virtually no maintenance whatsoever.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:02):**  I have a system on a home in Colorado.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:04):**  I used to live there.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:05):**  Now I rent the property.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:07):**  The only maintenance that's occurred, let's see, that was system went in in 1996.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:13):**  So figure out how many years, 22 years.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:15):**  The only maintenance I've had to do is I had to go up and fix a little piece of conduit  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:20):**  that was protecting the wire, and I had to tighten a bolt so they'd come loose.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:25):**  That's it for a grid type system.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:27):**  Wow.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:28):**  Really, really low maintenance.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:30):**  Really, really low maintenance.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:32):**  And I always encourage people if they're thinking about going grid type to install the micro  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:38):**  inverters.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:39):**  And the reason I recommend them is they come with a 25-year warranty.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:43):**  So if there's any kind of problem, the company will replace them in 25 years.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:49):**  That's pretty dang good.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:50):**  So I really like the micro inverters.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:53):**  I've had personally really good experience installing them.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:57):**  They've been very reliable.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:16:58):**  I think I've had one go bad in 10 years, and that in a customer system.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:05):**  So I like them a lot, and I like that 25-year warranty.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:10):**  The main type of inverter called a string inverter, they come with much shorter warranties,  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:18):**  which tells you something, right?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:20):**  If something comes with a five-year warranty, that's still pretty good, but it means you  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:25):**  might have some problems after five years.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:27):**  And I've had more trouble with the string inverters having to replace them, and they're  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:32):**  pretty expensive to replace three, four thousand dollars.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:35):**  So now when you go to batteries, it's really just a matter of either a grid-type system  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:41):**  with battery backup or an off-grid system, totally battery-based system.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:47):**  The main maintenance just is every month checking those batteries to make sure that the water  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:55):**  level is covering those lead plates.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:17:58):**  And it doesn't take that long, but it's something you must do.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:04):**  Now here's the problem, is when most people install batteries, the first year there's  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:08):**  no maintenance.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:09):**  They just don't require water.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:11):**  It's kind of like what we call the honeymoon phase.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:14):**  Everything is just hunky-dory, and then after a year they get very demanding.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:19):**  It's like, you better be on them every month.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:21):**  Make sure that water level's correct.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:25):**  So if you don't and you let them dry out, you've ruined a battery bank.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:29):**  And so now that said, there are some really nice automatic watering systems, which I highly  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:35):**  recommended.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:36):**  That's what I put on my system in Colorado.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:38):**  Actually it's a system that each battery gets hooked up to a pipe, a piece of tubing, and  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:46):**  then you just basically stick this tubing down in a gallon jug full of distilled water  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:51):**  and pump the distilled water into those batteries.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:57):**  You don't have to remove battery caps or anything.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:18:59):**  Just pump them until they're full and you're done.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:01):**  So my batteries in Colorado used to take 30, 35, 40 minutes to check and fill.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:10):**  It became a five-minute job.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:12):**  And it was much easier to think about, oh, it's time for batteries.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:16):**  Okay, it's only going to be five minutes.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:18):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:19):**  Whereas in the old system, it's time to check batteries.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:22):**  Oh, geez, I don't have 35, 40 minutes right now.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:25):**  I'll do it next time.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:26):**  You know, and then we'll push it on down the line.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:29):**  Yeah, it becomes a year later.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:32):**  So that's pretty much it for maintenance in both systems.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:37):**  Very infrequently do we ever have to clean modules?  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:40):**  You know, I've never cleaned a solar module.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:44):**  If you lived off a really dusty road, you might have to go out there and spray them  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:48):**  with a hose once in a while.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:49):**  But by and large, rain takes care of the cleaning.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:53):**  Very, very little maintenance in these systems, which is cool.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:56):**  Now, can we get a rinse?  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:19:57):**  Did you ever have a problem with like snow cover in Colorado?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:00):**  Yeah, I did.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:02):**  You know, we lived in the foothills up in Evergreen, Colorado.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:06):**  And we would typically get evening snow.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:10):**  You know, it would snow six inches to 12 inches, sometimes two feet.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:15):**  And the solar array was just completely covered with snow.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:18):**  And so I had a scraper, a really soft rubber scraper on a long aluminum pole, and I would  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:26):**  just get on a ladder and I'd never get on the roof and just kind of pull that snow off.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:32):**  I do not have the problem now that we're living in Missouri, we just don't get the snow.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:38):**  So it just depends on where you are.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:40):**  And of course, you can wait it out.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:42):**  But I was just too impatient if I had, you know, when I was living off grid, if the modules  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:47):**  were covered with snow, I wasn't going to wait for two or three days for them to melt.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:51):**  I was going to get up there and get them running immediately.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:54):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:56):**  In the winter is not a good time to lose power either.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:20:59):**  No.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:00):**  In an off grid home, that's usually when your highest demands are.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:04):**  So there's the least amount of solar energy.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:06):**  And that's the period with your highest demand.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:11):**  So before we start breaking down how to calculate a system or figure out your consumption and  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:16):**  things like that, let's backtrack a little bit and talk about the different options for  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:20):**  generating your own power on a small scale.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:24):**  We've talked mostly about solar up until this point, but I know there's quite a few other  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:28):**  options.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:29):**  Yes, there are.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:30):**  There's one another option if you're in a good windy site is wind energy.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:35):**  And I have to emphasize good windy site, you know, like Kansas or Oklahoma or Wyoming and  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:43):**  parts of many parts of eastern Colorado.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:45):**  So you want to be in a good windy site.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:48):**  And wind energy in a site, in a good site, actually is pretty affordable.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:54):**  It's pretty economical.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:21:55):**  Solar tends to be a little cheaper just because of this mass production of solar modules.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:01):**  So solar's kind of done this, you know, it's kind of taken over the market just because  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:06):**  it's less expensive.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:07):**  But wind is a great, great resource, amazing resource in a lot of areas.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:13):**  Don't let anybody talk you into putting a turbine up on a short tower though.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:18):**  In order to get the power you need, that turbine really needs to be up there 100, 120 feet  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:24):**  above ground surface.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:26):**  So I really like wind.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:29):**  I love wind.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:30):**  I have my own wind turbine.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:31):**  I'm a nationally certified wind site assessor.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:34):**  I have installed a bunch of them.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:36):**  But there are fewer places where wind systems are suitable.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:41):**  And they do tend to be a little more costly just because the price of materials that go  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:47):**  into wind turbines haven't decreased like they have in solar.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:51):**  And the other...  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:52):**  Now as an assessor, what would you consider a site that shows a lot of potential?  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:22:58):**  Like what kind of constant or high wind speeds are you looking for in an area?  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:03):**  Personally, I would like to have at the tower height, say at 100 or 120 feet, I'd like an  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:09):**  average wind speed of 12 miles an hour at least.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:12):**  And that's all throughout the year or through most seasons?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:16):**  That's the average annual.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:18):**  Where can you get that kind of data?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:20):**  Can you make those sort of assessments yourself by doing a little online research?  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:24):**  Yeah, well, you know, it's pretty tricky, but there is a...  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:27):**  NASA has a website.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:29):**  It's the name is forgot.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:32):**  I've slipped my memory right now.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:33):**  But there...  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:34):**  There's a website for solar energy and meteorological data and you can actually go to your site,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:40):**  you know, the longitude and latitude, plug those numbers in, and it'll give you a chart.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:47):**  And then what you do is you tell it how tall your tower is going to be.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:51):**  And it will tell you the average wind speed in January, February, March, April, May, every  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:23:57):**  month of the year, and then an annual average.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:01):**  So that is one good way to do it.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:04):**  And it's a little tricky if you're not trained.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:06):**  I mean, it's a little hard to navigate through that website.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:09):**  The best way is to contact a certified solar installer or a company that installs wind  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:16):**  turbines and have them do an assessment for you.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:19):**  They can go online and get that data for you pretty easily.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:23):**  Okay, good.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:26):**  And generally...  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:27):**  No, go ahead.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:28):**  Just to say generally, you know, east of the Mississippi is not that great of a wind resource.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:33):**  Missouri is not that great of a wind resource, the northwestern corner.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:37):**  But when you start getting into North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska,  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:45):**  Wyoming, you've got some really good wind resources in those areas.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:50):**  Now, is it true that wind holds more kinetic energy the colder it is?  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:55):**  Oh, goodness, now I gotta think.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:24:59):**  Let's see.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:00):**  I heard, I can't remember where I got this information, but they were talking about how  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:05):**  wind farms installed in places like California, though they get the same wind speeds as, say,  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:11):**  southern Minnesota or North Dakota, in some cases, they produce less energy because cold  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:16):**  wind has higher kinetic energy.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:21):**  I think that what's really, the air density is primarily affected by humidity.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:26):**  Okay.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:27):**  And I think that that's, and I have, for some reason, I just can't remember what the relationship  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:33):**  is.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:34):**  But it's one of those factors that's pretty small.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:37):**  Okay.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:38):**  When you look at the power equation for wind product, for the power that's available in  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:42):**  the wind, air density is the least important factor of any of them.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:49):**  The wind speed, which is determined by your site and how tall your tower is, that's the  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:56):**  critical one.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:25:58):**  The power is a cubic function of that.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:00):**  In other words, the power that's available is V cubed.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:05):**  So if your wind speed is 10 miles an hour, it's 10 times 10 times 10 is the power that's  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:11):**  available.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:12):**  If it's 12, it's 12 times 12 times 12, which is a much bigger number.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:17):**  So that's really the critical thing to look at, is the tower height and the average wind  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:23):**  speed.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:24):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:25):**  All right, so let's talk about some of the other lesser known or less common forms of  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:30):**  generating power.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:31):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:32):**  Well, we haven't, we've talked about wind.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:34):**  There is a really cool way of generating electricity, and that is hydropower, or micro hydropower.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:42):**  Now wind is limited in its distribution compared to solar.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:47):**  Solar pretty much works anywhere.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:48):**  There's good solar sites pretty much anywhere.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:52):**  Wind there are fewer good sites.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:54):**  Still lots of them in this country.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:26:56):**  Micro hydro is basically diverting water from a small stream, running it downhill through  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:03):**  a pipe into a little turbine.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:05):**  It spins furiously as that water flows through it.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:10):**  That's much more limited because you need to be in mountainous terrain generally for  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:15):**  micro hydro to work.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:17):**  That's not always true, but generally those are the best places like the Rocky Mountains  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:22):**  or the Cascade Mountains.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:24):**  So you can see that this is a much smaller consumer base, if you will.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:29):**  Sure, if you don't have that drop in elevation, you're not going to get the head pressure  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:33):**  needed to generate any power.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:35):**  Precisely.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:36):**  I couldn't, I should be interviewing you.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:38):**  Good job.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:39):**  I'm good with some of the jargon.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:41):**  I did do a little bit in engineering.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:43):**  Good man.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:44):**  Good man.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:45):**  Now that's basically it.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:46):**  Now we tend to get stuck on electricity, but there are a lot of other ways to use renewable  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:54):**  energy.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:27:55):**  For example, I have always heated my homes with passive solar.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:01):**  This is one of the things I always tell people.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:03):**  Passive solar is basically you're designing your house and orienting your house so that  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:10):**  it will absorb that low angle winter sun during the period that you need it the most, when  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:17):**  you need heat the most.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:18):**  And so you basically build a home so that it's oriented in such a way and you build  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:25):**  it so the windows on the south side, there are more windows in the south side, and what  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:29):**  they do is they capture that low angle winter sun and provide heat throughout the winter  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:34):**  for free.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:36):**  It's really a highly overlooked technology, extremely cost effective.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:43):**  I always joke that it's such an important free source of energy.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:49):**  There ought to be a national law requiring every home builder to install some kind of  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:54):**  passive solar.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:55):**  Now I'm not proposing that.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:28:57):**  I don't want anybody to call me up and call me a socialist, but the fact of the matter  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:02):**  is it's just free heating for life.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:05):**  And if you could, every house that was built in this country could just include 25%.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:11):**  That's a significant impact that would have a significant impact on the amount of energy  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:17):**  we use to heat our homes.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:20):**  And what's really cool about passive solar, this idea of just capturing that low angle  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:25):**  winter sun through south facing windows, is everything you do to incorporate passive solar  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:32):**  heating will actually help your home stay cooler in the summer.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:36):**  Now I don't have time to go into all that.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:39):**  You can find that in my books.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:41):**  So you're getting more bang for your buck.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:43):**  You're getting a warmer home.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:45):**  Home is going to be naturally warmer in the winter and naturally cooler in the summer.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:51):**  So you're going to save on heating and cooling costs at very little additional expense, very,  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:56):**  very little additional expense.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:29:58):**  So that's something that people really ought to consider if they're looking at building  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:02):**  a retirement home or just starting their very first home.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:07):**  Look into the passive solar heating and cooling and design that home so you get anywhere from  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:12):**  50 to 80% of your heating and cooling for free.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:17):**  It's pretty phenomenal bargain for just a little bit of intelligent design.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:22):**  No, I agree.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:23):**  I'm so glad you mentioned that.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:24):**  It's one of the things that I teach in my courses and I have really looked into this  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:28):**  for a while.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:30):**  Not just the passive heating, like you mentioned, the passive cooling like that and how those  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:34):**  two can correlate with a similar design, how they feed into each other and some of the  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:39):**  really inventive ways that people all around the world have designed structures to take  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:45):**  advantage of the context, the climactic conditions where they are to create as comfortable the  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:52):**  space inside without having to import energy.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:30:56):**  And I know we're going to talk about this more in this interview, but no matter how  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:01):**  you're producing your energy or where you're getting it from, you're always going to benefit  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:05):**  by taking or making the best use of the free natural resources around you before you have  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:12):**  to put in some kind of more complex infrastructure or machinery to generate power to sort of  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:18):**  make up the difference from bad design or poor materials or building.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:24):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:25):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:26):**  Now, here's a good case example.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:28):**  Last year, we moved to Missouri, bought a house and unfortunately had a house fire in  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:34):**  2011.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:35):**  So I ended up rebuilding and of course I rebuilt this massive, not this massive, but this incredibly  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:42):**  efficient passive solar home.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:47):**  Our 50 walls, most homes are like R-19, R-100 ceilings, glass on the south side.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:31:55):**  And last summer, we have what's called an air source heat pump or a mini split for some  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:02):**  of the summer days to kind of cool it off.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:04):**  And last summer it broke down and my wife suggested, let's see if we can make it through  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:08):**  the summer without AC at all, any AC at all.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:11):**  And we did that, all that insulation and that proper design kept that house pretty cool.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:17):**  There were only a few days where we were uncomfortable.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:20):**  You know, we'd sleep with a fan on us at night.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:22):**  So it's an amazing benefit and we're just missing out on a free resource, just an absolute  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:30):**  free resource.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:32):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:33):**  Now, before we move on to another topic, are there any other forms of power generation  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:37):**  that you want to cover quickly?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:39):**  I would.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:40):**  I'd like to cover solar hot water.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:41):**  Now, for years, we've been installing solar hot water collectors on roofs.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:47):**  And basically what they're designed is to heat your water in your home.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:52):**  It's domestic hot water.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:54):**  Some of these systems can be expanded and be used for space heating, but they're not  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:58):**  too cost effective.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:32:59):**  But the solar hot water for domestic hot water is pretty cost effective.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:07):**  What we're finding though is that there's some new technologies that are kind of knocking  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:12):**  them out of the water, out of businesses.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:15):**  So if you're thinking, hey, I'd like to get free hot water or solar heated hot water,  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:21):**  what we're finding is it's much cheaper to just install about three or four solar modules  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:27):**  and in your home install what's called a hybrid water heater.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:32):**  And a hybrid water heater basically will suck heat out of the air, say, in your basement.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:40):**  It will heat your water.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:41):**  And so you can get most of your heat, most of your hot water just from heat in your home.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:47):**  And then if you need some more of this, there's a backup electric heating element in the unit.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:55):**  If you need more, you can get that from the solar module.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:33:57):**  So that new system, the solar electricity with a hybrid water heater is about half or  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:04):**  a third of the cost of a solar hot water system.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:07):**  So I would be remiss to not mention that.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:12):**  I do want to point out too is that we've overlooked the most obvious strategy, and that's energy  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:19):**  efficiency, making your home more energy efficient.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:22):**  That's the cheapest way to save energy.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:25):**  It's the cheapest way I kind of see it as a way of generating energy because every BTU  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:31):**  of energy or every kilowatt of energy that you don't use is kind of like making it.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:37):**  It's kind of a renewable energy resource.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:39):**  So that's where there's still some really simple things you can do to your home just  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:45):**  to trim your energy demand.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:47):**  And I would just check into those first before you even think about this other stuff I've  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:52):**  been talking about.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:53):**  Well, it's like you talked about in your house with the higher levels of insulation, the  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:34:58):**  glass put on strategic parts, especially high insulation in the roofs where most people  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:03):**  lose all of their heat or I mean, I guess cooling is a little bit different, but ventilation  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:07):**  comes more into play when you're talking about summer months or hotter climates.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:12):**  But yeah, I mean, that's a whole nother topic.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:15):**  We could go for at least another interview just on efficiency and how to cut energy consumption  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:22):**  on its own.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:24):**  Maybe we'll do that again sometime.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:25):**  But let's be happy to.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:27):**  The one thing I would say in the summer, most people don't realize it, but 40 percent of  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:31):**  their heat gain comes through the ceiling as the during on a hot summer day, your attic  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:37):**  will get up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit and then that heat leaks into your home.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:42):**  So adding that insulation for the winter also protects you in the summer.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:48):**  Just really important point.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:51):**  And that's what I think is really key, especially if you live in those climates where there's  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:54):**  a big temper differential between seasons where it swings like that.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:35:59):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:00):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:02):**  I've I've had a lot of a lot more experience working in areas with very forgiving climates.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:08):**  My last projects were in Guatemala and we didn't even have to think about insulation  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:12):**  because we're in a climate that they call a permanent spring.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:19):**  And so there was a lot that we could get away with.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:22):**  But now that I am moving around and working in other places again, I'm like, OK, I got  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:25):**  to kind of think insulation once again.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:28):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:30):**  All right.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:31):**  So let's start where we were talking about before from the beginning in calculating your  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:37):**  consumption and leading into how to size a system and assess which of your options are  
**[0:36:42-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:42):**  going to be best for your context.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:44):**  OK.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:45):**  All right.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:46):**  So now assessing how much energy use, how much energy, both natural gas or propane and  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:54):**  electricity is pretty easy if you've been living in a house.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:36:58):**  So if you're in a house now, all you need to do is look at your utility bills for the  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:02):**  last couple of years.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:04):**  I like people to go back two or three years, at least go back as far as you can.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:08):**  Well, two or three years.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:10):**  And then and then one look for trends.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:12):**  Is the energy use increasing?  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:15):**  If it is, you want to take that into account.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:17):**  If it's decreasing, you want to take that into account.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:19):**  But you can simply go to your utility bills and determine how many kilowatt hours of electricity  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:27):**  you use.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:28):**  It's all it's listed there.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:29):**  And the kilowatt hours is what the utilities, it's a measurement that utilities use to charge  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:36):**  you to bill you.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:37):**  So you can get that information, kilowatt hours used per month, per year from your bills.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:45):**  And then you can average it together.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:46):**  Or you can also go online oftentimes to your utilities website.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:50):**  If you have your account number, they will, that information will be available to you.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:37:55):**  And with that information, then you can size the solar electric system.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:00):**  Then you just basically, there's some calculation, a simple calculation you have to do to determine  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:06):**  that.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:07):**  Your best probably to, you know, to let a solar designer do that for you and size your  
**[0:38:11-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:11):**  system for you, because they will also take into account any possible shading.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:18):**  Say you're going to put a solar array on your roof, but it's shaded 10% of the year.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:23):**  You need to take that into account.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:24):**  And say your roof isn't exactly oriented to true south, which, you know, if it's not exactly  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:32):**  oriented right, you'll have to take that into account.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:34):**  But it's not that difficult to find out how much you use and then to determine a system  
**[0:38:40-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:40):**  size based on your annual energy consumption.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:48):**  And once you've figured out what sort of consumption you're likely going to have, even moving forward,  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:54):**  and predicting that maybe a couple of years ahead and some of the variables of like if  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:38:59):**  your family is going to grow, if you're going to be entertaining a lot or any of those variables  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:06):**  that, you know, kind of only you can assess, what's the next step from there?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:10):**  Do you recommend that most people call a professional or is this the type of, especially if we're  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:15):**  talking about solar, the type of system that someone could take on the installation of  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:19):**  themselves?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:20):**  Yeah, well, I would generally, you can do it yourself.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:24):**  Let me start.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:25):**  You can do it yourself.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:26):**  The math isn't that hard.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:29):**  But it's explained in I think more of my more advanced books like Solar Power from the Sun.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:35):**  I explain how you do the math.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:39):**  You could easily take it to an installer and just say, hey, here's my consumption.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:45):**  What size system do I need?  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:46):**  They can do it in seconds because they've done it so many times in your area.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:51):**  And better yet, they should come out to your site and determine it for you.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:39:55):**  As a rule, I don't recommend people install solar systems unless they're pretty skilled  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:01):**  and electrical and they have a pretty good idea of construction.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:05):**  You know, if you're mounting a solar system on a roof, you really need to know what you're  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:09):**  doing.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:10):**  They're actually pretty complicated to get, well, for a solar installer, it's not complicated.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:17):**  But for an individual who doesn't understand the electrical code, you can make a lot of  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:23):**  mistakes.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:24):**  So I generally recommend you hire someone either to help you, someone who's an installer,  
**[0:40:33-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:33):**  a certified installer or experienced installer, or you hire a company to do it for you.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:41):**  And so once you've decided on which type of system you're going to install, the size of  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:46):**  it and how you might install it, still people I know get hung up on the initial cost, because  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:52):**  like you mentioned in the beginning, though you are saving money in the long run, sometimes  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:40:57):**  it can be hard to come up with the funds to prepay that far in advance.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:02):**  But there's also a lot of different ways of saving money in that, that have come up recently,  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:07):**  things like grants, tax breaks, even buying in bulk through co-ops.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:11):**  Do you have any experience or recommendations for some of those alternative ways of financing  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:16):**  a system in the beginning?  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:18):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:19):**  I'm not going to repeat what you said, but it is a shock to someone.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:24):**  And so as an installer, what I always did was I showed people, here's your initial cost,  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:29):**  and here's what the electricity is going to cost over its lifetime using solar versus  
**[0:41:35-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:35):**  the utility grid.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:36):**  And that's pretty convincing when they find out they're going to be paying two or three  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:40):**  times more by just staying on the grid.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:43):**  But, you know, some people just can't come up with $25,000 or $30,000.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:49):**  You can take a loan for it.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:51):**  That's one option.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:53):**  There are other options like community solar.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:41:55):**  This is a movement that's popping up and becoming quite strong in states like Colorado and California.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:04):**  There are companies that install solar systems either on property or on buildings, so install  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:12):**  big systems.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:14):**  And you as a homeowner can buy a module or several modules, solar panels, and, you know,  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:23):**  say you show them your utility bill and they say, well, you need 10 modules.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:29):**  So for example, in Nashville, Tennessee, you can contact the company and they'll say, okay,  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:34):**  Dan, you know, here's how much electricity you use.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:37):**  You'd need 10 solar modules and they cost $250 apiece.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:42):**  They're going to stay in our facility, but all the electricity that they produce is charged,  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:50):**  is credited to your account.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:42:52):**  Now, that said, there are other places that I've run into companies that are actually  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:00):**  doing this for free.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:02):**  They're not charging customers.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:03):**  And like in West Virginia, there are companies that are not even charging customers.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:08):**  You just sign up and they basically start the electric power that comes from their solar  
**[0:43:17-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:17):**  farm gets credited to your account and is no additional upfront cost, which is crazy,  
**[0:43:23-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:23):**  crazy cool.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:24):**  That is wild.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:25):**  What's the incentive in that for them?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:27):**  I don't know.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:29):**  They must, I am not sure what they're doing.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:32):**  I wonder if they've got a different funding model.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:34):**  They might.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:35):**  They might be selling it to the utility indirectly and, you know, they're generating it at a  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:39):**  lower cost and just selling it to the utility.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:42):**  And I honestly don't know what their model is.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:46):**  I was shocked when I heard about it.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:47):**  I was absolutely shocked.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:50):**  I saw it at a Mother Earth News Fair when I was in Pennsylvania.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:52):**  I stopped and talked to the gal from the company.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:55):**  And most people, you know, most people, she said, kind of think, well, this is too good  
**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:43:59):**  to be true.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:00):**  It just can't possibly be true.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:01):**  But she assured me that was the case.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:04):**  So check into community solar.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:07):**  Another option is a lease.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:09):**  There are a lot of companies in the United States that will actually install a solar  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:14):**  system on your home at no cost to you.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:19):**  And basically, they pay for the equipment, they install it, and you get electricity now  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:26):**  from your solar system and you pay them directly.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:30):**  So let's say, Oliver, you're, say you're paying 10 cents a kilowatt hour from the utility  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:35):**  grid from your power company.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:37):**  They would maybe charge you nine to nine and a half cents a kilowatt hour.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:41):**  So you get a little bit of a savings.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:44):**  And usually after about 15 to 18 years, that solar system is yours.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:51):**  So from that point on, your electricity is free.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:44:54):**  So the advantage of that is you don't have to come up with upfront money.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:01):**  And someone else handles everything.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:03):**  The disadvantage is that you don't get all the tax breaks and, you know, things that  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:07):**  the benefits you're...  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:08):**  Okay.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:10):**  So if you installed that system yourself, you'd be generating electricity roughly at  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:15):**  six cents a kilowatt hour.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:17):**  So it'd be cheaper for you in the long run to do it yourself.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:21):**  But if you don't have that upfront money, this is a way to get into the market.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:24):**  And like I said, after 15 to 18 years, that system's yours.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:30):**  And these systems will operate easily for 30 years.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:34):**  You know, the modules come with a 25-year warranty.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:38):**  You've got another 15 years of free electricity.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:41):**  So it's a heck of a way to get into solar.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:44):**  It's an awfully good way.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:46):**  Now less common, there are some communities where people will go in together and buy modules  
**[0:45:53-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:53):**  in bulk.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:54):**  You know, they might...  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:45:55):**  The 10 or 20 families might go in together and buy a trailer load of modules.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:01):**  And they end up getting a pretty good discount.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:04):**  Now, there aren't too many programs like that that I've heard of, but it is something to  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:08):**  look into to see if there are any kind of community programs where they're buying in  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:14):**  bulk and getting the equipment at a discount and saving customers money that way.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:21):**  Now, you've thrown out a handful of figures there, around $25,000, $30,000 perhaps.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:29):**  Is that reflecting sort of the size or the cost of a system that would accommodate sort  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:36):**  of the average power consumption of a US home?  
**[0:46:40-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:40):**  Yeah, most homes right now, and this really varies, most homes that are mixed fuel, in  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:47):**  other words, electricity and natural gas or propane, most of them will require about a  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:54):**  10 KW system, a 10,000-watt system.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:46:57):**  And it's about $3 a watt.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:00):**  National average is a little higher.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:01):**  It's like three and a quarter or something.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:03):**  So you're looking at roughly $32,000 is your upfront cost for that solar system.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:10):**  Now, right now there's a federal tax credit at 25%, so you get that back.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:16):**  So this system would cost 25% less than that.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:19):**  So $8,000 less than that would be your cost.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:23):**  Now, if you've got an all electrical, Lord, now we're looking at double or triple that  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:29):**  size, so it's more costly.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:33):**  So this is why I tell you first thing off is get in there and find ways to save energy  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:39):**  so you don't need a 10 KW.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:41):**  You might be able to get by with a 7 KW or a 5 KW system.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:46):**  Save that energy first.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:47):**  Find ways to trim your electrical demand, and then you'll need a smaller solar system.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:54):**  Now can you give us maybe some examples from your own installation in your house?  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:47:58):**  Because you talked about how many power saving methods you've implemented yourself through  
**[0:48:04-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:04):**  just the insulation alone, I would imagine would take a huge bite out of that.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:08):**  And if you're sort of on a hybrid system that uses either natural gas or propane for some  
**[0:48:14-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:14):**  of the more consumptive appliances, what could you expect to pay on like a significantly  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:22):**  reduced consumption home like that?  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:26):**  Are you asking me how much can you save?  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:28):**  How much energy can I, how can I, I'm wondering if you can give us an example from either  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:32):**  your own home or others that you've seen where people have taken those more drastic measures  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:37):**  to reduce their consumption and how low they've realistically gotten down without having to  
**[0:48:42-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:42):**  compromise a huge amount of comfort or the appliances that they use in their home.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:50):**  You know, I don't have any numbers off hand, but the savings are enormous.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:48:54):**  And one thing we should, we should put in, we should, people should realize is that by  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:00):**  making your home more energy efficient, it's actually going to be more comfortable.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:04):**  It's going to be a lot more comfortable.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:06):**  When I taught at Colorado College, we often went out in a community that the school was  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:11):**  really big on community service.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:14):**  So I taught an energy class at Colorado College and we would go into these homes in the community  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:20):**  and we would energy retrofit.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:22):**  Unfortunately, we never got to look at energy bills before and after, but we would do things  
**[0:49:27-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:27):**  like we would run these tests to determine how leaky these homes were, how much air leakage  
**[0:49:34-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:34):**  occurs in these homes.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:36):**  And I remember one home in particular, we went and did this, this energy audit on this  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:42):**  home and this device that we use to measure leakiness basically simulates a 20 mile an  
**[0:49:49-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:49):**  hour wind blowing on a home.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:52):**  And when we went in there, our first measurements would be, were that when the wind was blowing  
**[0:49:57-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:49:57):**  20 miles an hour, the air infiltration rate was like 8,500 cubic feet per minute.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:06):**  Whoa.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:07):**  Yeah, a cubic foot of air is about the size of a basketball.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:12):**  So when the wind's blowing on that house, they've got roughly 8,500 basketballs full  
**[0:50:18-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:18):**  of cold air coming into their home.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:20):**  Now we went into that house for two or 300 bucks, let's just say 300 bucks.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:25):**  We did all the labor and we sealed up the leaks.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:29):**  That's the most important thing people should do in a home is get in there and seal up all  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:34):**  those leaks around doors and windows and at floor level.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:39):**  We went in and sealed up the leaks and then we insulated, added insulation to the ceiling  
**[0:50:44-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:44):**  and we were able to drop that, decrease that air infiltration by half, by 50%.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:52):**  Still not perfect, still not perfect, but that two or $300, probably closer to $300  
**[0:50:59-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:50:59):**  is going to make that home so much more efficient and so much more comfortable.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:05):**  It's unbelievable.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:07):**  It's not difficult to reduce your electric, your energy bill by 25%.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:13):**  And the most important thing to do is to hire an energy auditor who will come in and do  
**[0:51:20-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:20):**  a blower door test.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:22):**  That's the test I was just referring to.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:24):**  That's the test that determines how leaky your home is.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:28):**  And that little test might cost you $300 to $600.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:32):**  And then once they do the test, and they'll do other things as well, they'll look at insulation  
**[0:51:37-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:37):**  levels and appliances to see where you might be able to save energy and lighting and all  
**[0:51:43-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:43):**  that, all that stuff.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:45):**  But once they determine how leaky your house is, they can go around and seal up those leaks  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:51):**  and make your house so much more airtight, which is going to make it a lot warmer in  
**[0:51:56-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:56):**  the winter and a lot cooler in the summer.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:51:59):**  That's the first and most important thing anybody who's listening to us right now can  
**[0:52:04-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:04):**  do is just get out there and get an energy audit of their home and seal up those leaks,  
**[0:52:11-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:11):**  and add insulation, and then let's talk solar.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:14):**  Let's then let's see how much solar you're actually going to need or wind energy.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:20):**  Now, along those lines, Dan, I'm wondering your take on new, more energy efficient appliances.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:26):**  Because from what I've heard, though there have been a lot of advancements in the technology,  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:31):**  as people use less in their appliances, they just use their appliances more often to make  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:36):**  up the difference.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:37):**  Have you heard much about this?  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:39):**  Well, I don't know if that's true.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:42):**  If you buy an energy efficient refrigerator or an energy efficient freezer, you're going  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:49):**  to save enormous amounts of money.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:51):**  I started in this business in the 70s, and a typical refrigerator in the 70s used upwards  
**[0:52:59-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:52:59):**  of 2,000 kilowatt hours a year.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:02):**  Now you can get a fancy refrigerator with ice in the door and automatic defrost that  
**[0:53:08-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:08):**  maybe uses a quarter of that electricity.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:12):**  So it really pays to buy energy efficient appliances.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:17):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:18):**  Now, what kind of, what particular appliances have you been hearing about?  
**[0:53:24-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:24):**  That's kind of a generalization.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:25):**  What have you been hearing about that people use more of?  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:27):**  Well, I don't know that it's necessarily using more of the same appliances that save energy.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:33):**  But when people either feel better about having saved in one area, they feel liberated to  
**[0:53:38-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:38):**  consume in other areas, and they end up kind of evening out overall.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:42):**  Oh goodness, that may be the case.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:44):**  I don't know.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:45):**  I know back when I was a young university teacher, I was an avid kayaker, and I had  
**[0:53:51-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:51):**  a car that got 50 miles per gallon.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:53):**  Every kayak trip we ever took, every bird watching trip we ever took to Mexico, everybody  
**[0:53:59-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:53:59):**  said, let's take Dan's car.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:01):**  But that is interesting.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:04):**  I have not heard about that, but I wouldn't put it past Americans.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:07):**  They think, oh, well, we're saving energy here.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:10):**  We could just get more electric.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:12):**  Exactly.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:13):**  They get lax about other things.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:15):**  I think people eat chicken for dinners so they can have dessert, lower fat meat.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:21):**  Sure.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:22):**  That's a whole level of psychology that I don't know anything about.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:30):**  So along the lines of these appliances, have you seen any other promising innovations and  
**[0:54:34-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:34):**  advances, especially in home scale renewable energy systems that you'd like to mention  
**[0:54:40-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:40):**  here that give you a lot of optimism that these will be implemented more widely soon?  
**[0:54:46-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:46):**  Well, there are some really, if we're talking renewable energy systems, there are some new  
**[0:54:54-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:54):**  technologies on the horizon.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:54:57):**  And people always ask me, should I just wait?  
**[0:55:02-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:02):**  If you've got a solar cell, it's 17 or 18% efficient now.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:09):**  Shouldn't I just wait till they get up to 25 or 30%?  
**[0:55:13-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:13):**  And my answer is always no.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:16):**  No, my answer is always no.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:18):**  Get it now.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:20):**  The improvements in efficiency have been very, very slow to make it to market.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:26):**  And when you hear on the news about some brand new solar cell, it's 30% efficient and you've  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:32):**  got some solar guy trying to sell you one that's 18% efficient.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:37):**  Bear in mind that that 30% efficient solar cell is in the laboratory.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:44):**  It's not made in commercial production.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:47):**  Or if it is, it's used solely in outer space where they can afford to put an expensive  
**[0:55:52-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:52):**  solar module out there.  
**[0:55:53-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:55:53):**  So there's some really interesting stuff coming along with Quantum Dot to solar cells, to  
**[0:56:01-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:01):**  organic solar cells, some very, very promising stuff.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:06):**  But it's a ways from getting to market.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:08):**  So just get out there and buy efficient solar conventional modules that will last 30, 40,  
**[0:56:15-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:15):**  50 years.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:16):**  You will not be disappointed.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:18):**  Sure.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:19):**  And I would imagine that it works like so many other types of technology.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:23):**  You'll pay two, three, four times the price to get the latest model, the most efficient  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:27):**  one, the best processor, whatever it might be.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:31):**  And last year's models are nearly as good and now a fraction of the price because they've  
**[0:56:38-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:38):**  been one year outdated or they're just slightly older.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:41):**  Yeah, I bought one of the first calculators that hit the market.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:44):**  It cost me $250.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:45):**  Oh my goodness.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:46):**  And get this, it added, it subtracted, multiplied it, divided it, and it did square roots and  
**[0:56:53-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:53):**  squares for $250.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:55):**  Wow.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:56):**  Ten years later.  
**[0:56:58-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:58):**  Get those things away now.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:56:59):**  Everyone's got them on their phones.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:02):**  They might be good antiques.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:03):**  Right, right.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:04):**  Yeah, so I'm with you.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:06):**  Just get what you can now.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:09):**  Get efficient stuff now and don't wait for the technology to improve.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:14):**  One of the things that I want to say that just drives me crazy is we're always hearing  
**[0:57:18-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:18):**  politicians say, well, you know, with advances in solar technology, we can make this happen.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:25):**  We've got the technology here now.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:28):**  We do not have to wait for any innovation.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:31):**  We have cost effective technology.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:34):**  It's available now.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:37):**  We just not wait for researchers to come up with a 2% more efficient module.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:43):**  Put the stuff in now.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:44):**  Yeah, I completely agree.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:48):**  Now Dan, this has been a really good overview of all of these different types and considerations  
**[0:57:54-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:54):**  for small scale energy.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:57:56):**  Do you have any personal advice for people who are looking to get started?  
**[0:58:00-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:00):**  We talked a little bit about how to assess a site, but what are some other things that  
**[0:58:04-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:04):**  maybe they should consider that we might not have gone over?  
**[0:58:07-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:07):**  Well, we pretty much covered everything.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:09):**  I mean, looking at first of all, how much energy they use.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:14):**  This is where if I had a client came to me and asked me that question, I'd say, hey,  
**[0:58:18-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:18):**  let's how much energy do you use?  
**[0:58:20-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:20):**  How much energy do you use?  
**[0:58:22-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:22):**  Where can we cut back?  
**[0:58:24-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:24):**  Let's do that.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:26):**  Now let's think about the solar system or a wind system.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:31):**  And the next level of thinking is do I want grid tied, off grid or grid tied with battery  
**[0:58:37-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:37):**  backup?  
**[0:58:38-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:38):**  And then you have to just select the system that's going to work for you.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:42):**  Are you in a good wind site?  
**[0:58:44-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:44):**  Are you in just a good solar site?  
**[0:58:47-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:47):**  Do you need solar electricity and hot water?  
**[0:58:50-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:50):**  Now that's the thinking process really is it, how can we be more efficient?  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:57):**  What kind of system do I want?  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:58:58):**  Do I want to be off the grid or do I want to have that backup power or do I just not  
**[0:59:03-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:03):**  care?  
**[0:59:04-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:04):**  You know, are grid interruptions so rare that it doesn't make sense for me to go off?  
**[0:59:11-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:11):**  And then you have to carefully select what system, whether you want solar electric or  
**[0:59:17-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:17):**  wind electric or micro hydro.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:22):**  But don't forget hot water.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:23):**  Don't forget space heating.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:25):**  I mean, that's pretty, we pretty much covered it.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:28):**  And if you start looking for installers, find someone who's been in the business for a while.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:36):**  It just makes sense to go with people that have been doing it for a goodly amount of  
**[0:59:41-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:41):**  time.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:42):**  They have the most experience, they know what they're doing.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:45):**  So look when you shop around, I hate to say this to all the newbies in the field, but  
**[0:59:50-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:50):**  you know, just look for people who have been in the business for a while and maybe five  
**[0:59:55-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=0:59:55):**  or 10 years and look at how many systems they've installed.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:00):**  What kind of reputation they have.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:02):**  It's really good to check out in advance, call some of their customers and how were  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:07):**  they?  
**[1:00:08-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:08):**  Did they get the work done quickly?  
**[1:00:09-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:09):**  Did they do a good job?  
**[1:00:11-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:11):**  You know, were they clean?  
**[1:00:12-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:12):**  You know, did they clean up the work site?  
**[1:00:16-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:16):**  If you had a problem, were they there the next day or two days later, not two months  
**[1:00:21-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:21):**  later?  
**[1:00:22-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:22):**  And that's the sort of thing you need to look into as well.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:26):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:27):**  I think that's good advice just for generally looking for any service provider.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:32):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:33):**  Great.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:34):**  So, Dan, before I let you go here, can you tell our listeners how they can get in contact  
**[1:00:38-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:38):**  with you and find many of those resources and books that we've been glossing over?  
**[1:00:43-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:43):**  Well, all my books are available in bookstores and through my publisher, New Society Publisher,  
**[1:00:51-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:00:51):**  but also through the more conventional outlets like Barnes and Noble, of course, Amazon.com.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:00):**  So you can get your books there.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:01):**  I used to sell them through my website, but I closed that down and we're just basically  
**[1:01:05-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:05):**  selling through the conventional sources.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:07):**  Now, there are some books that I've written on my own and published myself.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:12):**  I've written books on Chinese greenhouses and books on total self-sufficiency, books  
**[1:01:17-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:17):**  on living off-grid, and I sell them myself.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:22):**  You can learn about it.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:23):**  I have a website called windrivermusic.net, and I have a list of those books on there,  
**[1:01:30-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:30):**  and you can purchase them directly through me.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:32):**  Fantastic.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:33):**  Well, I'll make sure to link to all those resources in the show notes for this episode  
**[1:01:37-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:37):**  when it's published.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:38):**  And, Dan, it was such a pleasure finally getting to talk to you.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:41):**  I've really enjoyed the resources that you've put out there.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:44):**  This is the first time by going through some of these manuals that these different systems  
**[1:01:50-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:50):**  were put in a simple enough way that it didn't seem so daunting, and I feel like I finally  
**[1:01:55-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:01:55):**  got the concept and have been able to likewise recommend some of these things to my clients  
**[1:02:00-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:02:00):**  as well.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:02:01):**  So thanks so much for taking the time to put that out there and for being with us here  
**[1:02:04-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:02:04):**  today.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:02:05):**  It's been a pleasure.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dan-chiras/#t=1:02:06):**  Thank you.

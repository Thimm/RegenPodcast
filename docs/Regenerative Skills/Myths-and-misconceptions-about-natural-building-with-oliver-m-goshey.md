**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:05):**  of natural building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:09):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher, and today I have a special episode for you.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:13):**  Unlike normal when I'm interviewing industry leaders or experts in the field, today I'll  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:17):**  be giving a talk specifically on busting myths and misconceptions about natural building.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:23):**  I've got a lot of material to cover, so let's jump right on in.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:37):**  Now like I said, today is a special episode, and we'll be talking about some of the myths  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:41):**  and misconceptions around natural building, and I'll explain them in detail so that you  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:45):**  don't get discouraged, and so that you're not misinformed when you start your own projects.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:50):**  Now there are a lot of myths and misconceptions around the costs especially of building with  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:55):**  natural materials.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:00:56):**  A lot of people think that natural building is cheaper in all regards.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:00):**  A lot of people also think that it's easier to build with natural materials than it is  
**[0:01:04-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:04):**  conventional materials, or that all natural homes are inherently more energy efficient.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:11):**  So first, let's start by defining natural building just so that we're on the same page.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:16):**  There are a lot of different opinions about this, but the simplest definition is that  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:21):**  you build with minimally processed materials, ideally that haven't changed much from their  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:26):**  natural form and place.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:28):**  This doesn't mean that natural building can't include things like steel and concrete when  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:32):**  they're necessary, but it means that a large emphasis is put on using materials such as  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:37):**  earth, stone, wood, or grasses that come from the build site or as near as possible.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:43):**  Now I could also talk for a long time all about the details and intricacies of these  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:48):**  criteria, but that'll be a different episode.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:51):**  So for now, let's talk about why many people think that natural building is always cheaper.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:01:56):**  For one thing, natural materials are often free or very cheap.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:01):**  Many industrial products, such as doors and windows, can be recycled or salvaged from  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:06):**  old buildings or the waste stream.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:09):**  Often times heavy machinery and equipment isn't used on natural building projects,  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:14):**  and many natural building projects use volunteer or student labor to complete portions of the  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:19):**  project.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:20):**  So, one of the reasons why people think that these projects are so cheap is that many people  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:26):**  don't factor in transportation costs or excavation or harvesting costs into the build  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:31):**  estimate.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:32):**  These jobs, done by hand, are often more expensive than paying to have them done professionally  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:37):**  or renting equipment.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:39):**  Now while many recycled and salvaged components can be gotten for free, many places have also  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:45):**  gotten wise to the value of salvaged products and it's becoming harder and harder to get  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:49):**  good quality, free building supplies.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:52):**  In many cases, outside of rich, overdeveloped areas such as North America or Europe, almost  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:02:59):**  everything gets used and very little useful goods are thrown away.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:05):**  Where I am, for example, in Guatemala, I really can't count on finding good quality or used  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:11):**  construction supplies.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:13):**  Now these days, the reason that there is very little heavy machinery on natural building  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:18):**  sites is that the projects tend to be relatively small.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:21):**  I actually happen to know quite a few build projects and contractors that use diggers,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:26):**  backhoes, bobcats, or even tractors to save money on labor on their job sites.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:31):**  Now while many natural builders inherently shy away from using heavy equipment, it certainly  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:36):**  doesn't mean that you can't or that it's not useful on a natural building site.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:41):**  Now the topic of volunteer or student labor is very tricky and sometimes complicated or  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:46):**  controversial.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:48):**  While there is no doubt that volunteers can potentially be a huge help in completing a  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:52):**  project, in many cases it can cost more in the management, necessary facilities that  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:03:58):**  are needed, and other hidden costs to host students and volunteers than to just hire  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:02):**  professional labor.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:04):**  I'll cover more on this topic in another time, it's really broad and people always have questions  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:10):**  and different opinions about it, but like I said, I'll get to it on another talk.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:14):**  The bottom line is that while all of these techniques listed can bring down the cost  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:18):**  of construction, they can't always be counted on to cut costs on a project, and in some  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:23):**  cases like machinery or free labor, the opposite can actually be true.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:28):**  Now I also want to talk about something that I like to call the myth of the $100 house.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:33):**  So there are a ton of examples online in places like Facebook, natural building forums, and  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:37):**  websites where people brag about how they built a house or a building for some ridiculously  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:42):**  tiny sum.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:44):**  This is where a lot of the misconceptions about the real cost of natural building comes  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:48):**  from.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:49):**  So there are a number of ways that they arrive at these numbers, and all of them involve  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:53):**  admitting certain expenses and selective accounting.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:04:57):**  So let's start with the first and usually the biggest one, not counting the cost of  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:01):**  labor.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:03):**  So you should always be counting the cost of your own labor, the cost of free labor,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:08):**  or even if you're not using money to compensate people, counting the cost when it comes to  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:15):**  providing facilities and extra resources to those who are working for you.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:20):**  Now this is actually a little bit tricky to do and it's easy to see why people often omit  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:24):**  this expense, because if you're not exchanging money exactly, it can be really hard to calculate  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:30):**  exactly what you're paying for these.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:33):**  But I'll give you an example.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:34):**  So if someone built a house and it took them three years to build it, but only cost them  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:39):**  say $1,000 in materials, did the project cost $1,000?  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:45):**  Well no, because you lost about three years of wages by putting that time into your project.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:51):**  And this is what's called opportunity cost.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:54):**  And it's really worth taking into account, because if you're not making money in some  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:05:58):**  other way and you're putting that energy into your project, that money has to come from  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:02):**  somewhere, nobody can live on nothing.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:04):**  Or even if you do, so much of your time needs to be going into creating your own needs,  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:10):**  I mean that's a whole other topic.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:12):**  So in this case you're either living off your savings or you've got another income stream  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:17):**  coming in from somewhere else to help support you.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:20):**  So that the time that you're putting into this project is not free time.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:25):**  Now maybe you're being really generous or stingy with yourself and you consider yourself  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:30):**  to be unskilled labor and maybe consider your time to be paid at the minimum wage, which  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:37):**  these days is unfortunately low.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:40):**  But I promise you that within a month even minimum wage racks up and if your material  
**[0:06:47-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:47):**  costs were $1,000 you can easily go beyond that just on a minimum wage pay scale of time  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:55):**  in just one month.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:06:57):**  But now if you have some construction experience, say you know a bit about carpentry or masonry  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:04):**  or you know any other building trade, you should be paying yourself or considering your  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:11):**  hours worth what it would cost to hire a professional.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:15):**  And these days that's anywhere between $20 and $50 an hour on average and it can go up  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:20):**  more.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:22):**  Now those costs rack up really fast and again if this person worked on their house for three  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:27):**  years certainly the cost of that building project was not just the cost of material.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:34):**  So that's an example.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:35):**  Now the other one that's pretty common is forgetting to count design planning and preparation  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:41):**  time.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:44):**  Now again this is easy to do if you're not exchanging money for it but this can count  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:49):**  for a very significant amount of time before the project even gets started.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:07:56):**  And the project costs are not only when you break ground and begin to construct the walls  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:01):**  of the foundation for example, all of the preparation and planning need to be considered  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:06):**  as well.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:08):**  Now lastly the other big one that people often forget to count is the cost of transportation.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:14):**  Now this usually shows up as the cost of gasoline and again it's hard to separate say if you're  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:19):**  using your car or your truck for personal reasons as well as project reasons at the  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:24):**  same time it's kind of hard to divide the cost of gasoline in those projects.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:30):**  But it's worthwhile because if you're constantly going back to the hardware store or to the  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:35):**  lumber yard or you know to fetch materials or whatever you could burn up hundreds and  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:39):**  hundreds of dollars in gas especially at prices today over the course of a build project.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:44):**  So always keep those things in mind.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:47):**  Now getting into another concept that I really want to touch on is what I like to call the  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:52):**  two of three choice.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:54):**  Now in general and this counts for things not just natural building but any other type  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:08:58):**  of project there is a list of three options cheap fast and quality and I'll repeat those  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:05):**  again because they're very important cheap fast and quality.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:09):**  Now in any given case you're allowed to pick two and only two of those three.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:14):**  For example if you want a cheap building and you want it built at a high quality it's going  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:19):**  to take a long time.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:20):**  If you want your house done fast and at high quality it's going to be expensive.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:25):**  If you want a cheap house built fast it's probably going to be very low quality.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:31):**  Now if anyone can figure out how to get all three of those at the same time I would love  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:34):**  to hear about it but until now I have not found a way around this rule.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:39):**  Now let's talk about another misconception the ease of building with natural materials.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:44):**  Now the basics of natural buildings such as cob mixing making adobe is a nailing wood together  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:49):**  is indeed really easy.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:50):**  In fact the basics of any job are simple.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:53):**  I've taught students within an hour how to start building cob walls or setting foundation  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:09:57):**  stones but if you want to do any of these tasks at a high level or if quality is really  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:04):**  worthwhile to you it's also worth taking the time to learn study and practice these skills.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:10):**  Working with natural materials in fact can be much harder because they aren't standardized.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:14):**  The irregularities of subsoil, round pole timber, and wonky shaped rocks often makes  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:20):**  them trickier to understand and tougher to make conform to tight measurements and straight  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:25):**  or even curved lines.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:28):**  Now the last big misconception is that natural building is always energy efficient.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:34):**  So it's true that there tends to be an emphasis in natural building to design structures in  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:38):**  a way that are very energy efficient by using things like passive solar gain, off grid energy  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:43):**  systems, highly insulative walls, and others.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:47):**  But it's equally important to know that these things are figured out in the designs and  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:51):**  are not inherent to natural building.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:53):**  In fact you can achieve all these results with conventional or industrial materials  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:57):**  as well.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:10:59):**  But the opposite is true too.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:01):**  If you design poorly or decide to use the wrong materials for the wrong applications  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:05):**  you could end up with a very energy consumptive house or a very uncomfortable one even though  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:10):**  you used all natural materials.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:13):**  Now I actually happen to know people who have built large and beautiful natural structures  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:19):**  only to abandon them after a short time because they were really uncomfortable to live in  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:23):**  or made no sense in the climate where they were built.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:26):**  I'll give you two quick examples without naming any names or embarrassing anybody.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:31):**  One was a super Adobe project which was done really well.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:35):**  The beautiful building got finished at a really high quality and the walls were extremely  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:40):**  thick, up to two feet in thickness in a lot of areas.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:46):**  And this design works fantastic in theory because we're in a kind of a tropical area  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:50):**  and the thick walls help to keep out the heat of the day and keep a cool temperature on  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:54):**  the inside.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:11:55):**  However, we're also at really high elevation and we never reached the really high temperatures  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:01):**  the way that they do on the coast because of the elevation we're at.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:05):**  And so what happened was those walls worked too well.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:09):**  It kept the interior of the house really cold all the time and sometimes a little damp as  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:13):**  well.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:14):**  And the owner ended up in the end after just a couple of seasons building a conventional  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:19):**  hollow block structure right on the side and frankly that's where they live now.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:25):**  Another example is I had some neighbors when I was doing a project in Senegal which gets  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:30):**  really high temperatures.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:31):**  We were right on the coast and they decided to go with an NGO who specialized in building  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:37):**  Nubian vaults.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:39):**  And Nubian vaults are fantastic.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:40):**  They keep really good interior temperatures in hot climates and in that way they worked  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:45):**  really well.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:46):**  It was really comfortable on the inside but they had a different problem.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:49):**  Where we were we got a pretty significant rainy season and the adobe roofs, the arches  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:12:56):**  that were made as the roofs on the dome, got worn down and weathered really fast to the  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:02):**  point where they were cracking and even leaking.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:05):**  And again after just a couple of seasons they realized that this wasn't the right material  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:09):**  to build their roof out of and they actually ended up encasing the entire dome in a separate  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:15):**  structure with laminar roof and I'm pretty sure it was mostly concrete block around the  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:21):**  outside.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:22):**  So they basically built a house around their house just to avoid constantly doing maintenance  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:28):**  on it.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:29):**  So the point is don't skim over the design stage.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:34):**  The materials matter but they don't matter nearly as much as a well designed space.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:38):**  If you're getting into natural building as a career path for example, it's really worth  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:42):**  spending time studying design and landscape management almost as much as the individual  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:48):**  building skills as well.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:50):**  Because even if you don't plan on being a professional designer, you'll likely come  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:13:55):**  up with this situation which I've dealt with many times where you have to explain or teach

**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-012-myths-and-missconceptions-about-natural-building/#t=0:16:48):**  Just remember that even the most natural of buildings can still be a total bummer to live

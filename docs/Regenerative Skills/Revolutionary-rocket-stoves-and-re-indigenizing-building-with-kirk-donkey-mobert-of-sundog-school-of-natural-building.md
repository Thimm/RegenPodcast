**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds of natural  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:04):**  building, permaculture, and regenerative living. I'm your host Oliver Gaucher and I have a fantastic  
**[0:00:09-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:09):**  guest for you today so let's jump right on in. Now for those of you who are just as interested as I  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:22):**  am in rocket stove technology then you've come to the right episode. Today I'm going to be  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:27):**  interviewing Kirk Mobert also known as Donkey. Now Kirk first started out working for a comic book  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:33):**  color separations house by the name of Ollie Optics and 15 years later decided to get out of  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:39):**  the computer graphics game and go into natural building. As a former teacher with the Cobb  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:44):**  Cottage company he worked with Yanto Evans and Linda Smiley for a number of years though says  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:49):**  he is most proud of the contributions that he made to understanding and properly constructing  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:54):**  rocket mass heaters. He's now given roughly a decade to the open source investigation of  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:00:59):**  rocket mass technology and is quite happy that things are finally ready for the general public.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:01:04):**  Kirk now describes himself as a teacher of alternative approaches and ways to think about  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:01:09):**  human habitation and in this episode we're going to get into some of his unique views about  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:01:14):**  re-indigenizing the building process. We also got to talk about some of the history and some of the  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:01:19):**  development that it's taken to getting rocket stove and rocket mass heater technology to the  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:01:24):**  point where it is now and one of my favorite sections of this interview which is always  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:01:29):**  important to people is talking about what the real cost of natural building is and getting rid of some  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:01:35):**  of the mist and some of the misconceptions about what it actually costs to build with natural  
**[0:01:40-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:01:40):**  materials. You're definitely not going to want to miss this episode so let's jump right in.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:02:10):**  you  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:02:41):**  Hello Kirk thank you so much for joining me today. I know we've got a whole bunch of material to get  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:02:46):**  into so let's just jump right in with the first question. So starting at the beginning how did  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:02:50):**  you first learn about natural building and what material interested you the most when you were  
**[0:02:54-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:02:54):**  first getting started? So uh 20 plus years 22 years ago now we bought this property. No no no  
**[0:03:06-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:03:06):**  sorry that's not right. 19 plus years ago we built this property we bought this property  
**[0:03:15-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:03:15):**  and we knew that we didn't want the same old kind of structure to live in you know it's pretty much  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:03:24):**  we bought it as raw property the building that was here already was kind of rotting and never  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:03:29):**  been finished so they just kind of had it under tarps and it was rotting so what we did is we  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:03:36):**  had an opportunity to sort of sweep off the old building and save stuff to rebuild the new one and  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:03:44):**  but we didn't want the same old same old so I went looking and was really interested in  
**[0:03:51-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:03:51):**  earthships at first and looked into you know a lot of different stuff and found Cobb Cottage Company.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:02):**  We decided to build a straw bale you know just a straw bale house on our site but I got interested  
**[0:04:09-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:09):**  in Cobb at first and then you know went and took a Cobb workshop and started fiddling around  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:18):**  for a little while and then I went back and I got sick of what I was doing you know I was a  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:26):**  computer graphics guy I had colored comic books and stuff and I got sick of what I was doing  
**[0:04:31-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:31):**  and decided to sort of like change jobs so to speak so it just sort of inspired me to get into  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:39):**  natural building and learn something more physical you know for a change and so I became a natural  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:46):**  builder. All right now I have to ask where does the nickname Donkey come from? Well when I was a  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:53):**  comic book colorist you know I as a color separator for comic books I worked for Marvel and DC and  
**[0:04:59-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:04:59):**  stuff like that but here on the coast for a company called Oleoptics back in the the late  
**[0:05:07-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:07):**  80s and early 90s and we all had nicknames you know so I was the network administrator and I  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:16):**  colored comic book the comic books and I would fix the computers and you know so I kind of knew  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:23):**  all the ins and outs of the business so when we go to comic book conventions you know once or twice  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:28):**  a year to get work I was the guy that they would take along on the comic book convention and I  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:34):**  would drive the van with the computers and all the junk in it and then I'd go and I'd set up all the  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:40):**  junk and so I got the name Donkey because I was toting all the stuff so it just stuck.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:50):**  How did you come to start your own natural building company and what were your goals  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:53):**  when you first started? Well I mean as I said before you know I just got sick of the comic book  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:05:59):**  thing and you know I had to do something else or it wasn't just comics at that point it was  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:06):**  you know it's more natural I mean computer graphics at that point you know anyway so I  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:11):**  had to do something else I was sick of it so my goals my goals were basically just to you know  
**[0:06:17-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:17):**  kind of have sort of a day job and do natural building for other people and it kind of expanded  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:27):**  from there into teaching because I ended up teaching more than anything you know I sort of  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:31):**  insisted that the people that I worked for would help me at least a little bit so they understood  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:36):**  what what they were getting you know they could take care of it later so yeah when I first started  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:42):**  my goals were just to have a work you know a job that was different than the original.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:48):**  So tell me what are some things that set your school and your workshops apart from other  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:52):**  natural building organizations and what are some unique aspects that you guys are good at?  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:06:56):**  I think our philosophy our basic core philosophy is that the natural building  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:05):**  natural building itself is not a set of materials  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:13):**  but it's more of a way of looking at problems you know  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:20):**  wherever you go you know natural building is is real for me actually I would say I would say the  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:26):**  natural building is a re-indigenization of of building in other words taking back into the  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:34):**  hands of the people who live in the house itself the task of building the house itself  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:43):**  you know and so that means like wherever people have built traditionally  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:47):**  you know indigenous builders what they do is they build with what's of where they are of the place  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:52):**  where they're from you know because that's what you have at hand we didn't have you know a free  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:07:58):**  energy where I should say an abundant energy source like oil in the mix so we couldn't bring  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:06):**  you know straw bales from a thousand miles away or or something like that you know to to build with  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:13):**  so we built with what we had and I would say re-indigenization means that if you live in a  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:19):**  city and you have a lot of recycled materials like steel and glass and stuff like that  
**[0:08:25-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:25):**  building with those materials is natural building and and you know if you live in a forest  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:33):**  building with wood and mud and stuff like that is natural building and there are obviously  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:37):**  crossovers you know where you could find you know a lot of people who live in the forest  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:42):**  you could find good clay soil in both the city sometimes and in the forest or on you know on a  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:48):**  hillside in the desert you know you can find a lot of the similar materials that are natural  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:08:53):**  but you also add in what you have and we we stress going into the waste stream and pulling  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:00):**  out recycled stuff and trying not to like buy new vinyl windows or something like that you know  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:05):**  so I guess for me the the the the way of looking at solving the problem is natural building rather  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:12):**  than the materials you're using as an anecdote right so there's this magazine called natural  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:19):**  homes magazine and it's got really cool natural buildings inside and I had bought you know I used  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:26):**  to buy it I was pretty regular on this rag and once there was an article inside of this woman who  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:33):**  she lived up pretty high on a mountain someplace in Colorado and she won yeah in Colorado and she  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:39):**  wanted to build you know a natural home and but in order to build a natural home on Colorado you  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:45):**  know she needed she wanted a straw bale home with adobes and and earthen plasters and so she went  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:52):**  down to New Mexico and she ordered all her adobes from New Mexico which is like I don't know how far  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:09:58):**  away you know like a thousand miles in one direction and then she she went down into  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:04):**  California to get rice straw bales which is you know like a thousand miles in the other direction  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:11):**  and she had all the stuff shipped in on top of this mountain so that she could build this  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:15):**  and you know like admittedly really beautiful natural home but but by the time I was done  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:21):**  reading the article I kind of you know throw in the rag you know the magazine against the wall  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:26):**  because you know it's like for me that is antithetical to what the natural building  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:33):**  ethos is or what you know what our  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:39):**  I guess what our our ethic sort of an ethic of trying to be you know less embodied energy  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:46):**  and to build with what's around you I guess I got off track there but but so for me you know  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:10:53):**  our school that's its main thrust is to try to re-indigenize the process make it available to  
**[0:11:00-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:00):**  people as a way of looking at the issue rather than a set of materials and skills to deal with  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:09):**  those materials if you know what I mean. Now as you know really well building with Cobb can be  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:14):**  incredibly labor intensive what are some tips and techniques that you found to make the mixing and  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:19):**  building as efficient as possible? Well for me the the most important thing is to reduce the  
**[0:11:25-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:25):**  number of steps so as far as mixing is concerned you know I don't dry mix ahead because I see a  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:32):**  lot of people they'll throw their sand out and they'll throw their soil in and then some people  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:36):**  will even throw the straw in which I think is a huge mistake and they'll put it all in dry  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:41):**  and then they'll get a couple people on the tarp and they'll roll it back and forth  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:45):**  to dry mix it I don't I don't do that nonsense because that's a step you know like you do a lot  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:51):**  of rolling when you step on the stuff so I put you know I dump the sand and the soil  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:11:59):**  on the tarp and wet that and then what I try to do is I try to pay attention to how much water  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:05):**  I'm using for subsequent mixes you know so I'll I'll fill up a bucket and you know at first I'll  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:10):**  be checking how much water I'm using out of the bucket for each mix but then once I get it you  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:15):**  know then I can just fill the bucket to that place so that's always good you know to reduce steps so  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:19):**  then at some point you know you're putting out the amount of soil that you use you're putting out the  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:23):**  amount of sand you use just pile them on it doesn't matter what you do first and then kind of  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:32):**  kind of make a hole in it you know like you've got a mound you make sort of a donut hole in the  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:36):**  middle and you pour the water just dump it in because you know I don't want the water to run away  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:41):**  but I don't make a lot of fuss about it just dump the water in and then I get straight to  
**[0:12:45-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:45):**  stomping with a tarp I get one person on a tarp you know and I like fairly big tarps I like a good  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:12:53):**  like eight by fifteen or ten or sorry ten by fifteen tarp fairly large tarp because so what I  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:00):**  do is I pick up the corners one corners of the long end of the tarp and I put it in the tarp  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:05):**  and I pick up the corners of the long end of the tarp and I just hold on to them and so that I'm  
**[0:13:10-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:10):**  stomping on the pile and I'll walk backwards with the tarp and just sort of constantly flipping the  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:19):**  the mix left right left right left right while I walk on the pile and that'll that'll work the  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:25):**  the pile all the way to one side of the tarp so then I'll lay the tarp out flat and I'll go  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:30):**  the other side of the tarp and then I'll do the same thing I'll pick up the corners and I'll work  
**[0:13:35-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:35):**  my way back the other way when you do that then then there's not as much bending over to pick up  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:45):**  the tarp you don't pick up the tarp and set it down and you know flip it set it down pick up the  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:49):**  tarp flip it set it down that's that's too many that's a lot of repetitive motion and it actually  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:13:54):**  comes back up by the end of the day so so I pick up the corners of the tarp work it work the  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:00):**  material to the other end of the tarp and then flatten it out flip around and repeat so then  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:06):**  when I want to add the the the straw in now what I'll do is I'll I'll work the cob you know the  
**[0:14:14-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:14):**  sand soil mixture out kind of thin on the tarp sort of all over it and I'll take the straw and  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:22):**  walk around that thin bit and I'll add straw and kind of stomp it in right there without flipping  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:30):**  I'll just get as much straw as I think I'm going to need into the mix all at once in that one step  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:36):**  you know and so you know I'll just feel with my feet there's a soft spot and I'll throw a  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:40):**  little straw in it and then walking in and you know you just kind of get to the the right  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:44):**  consistency all the way around and once you've got that then it's really important not to just  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:48):**  roll the freaking cob over on itself all in one go because you'll end up with a hairball on the  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:54):**  middle and a bunch of cob on the outside with no straw in it so then you just go you work your way  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:14:59):**  around the tarp and you flip in the edge just a little bit you flip it in by degrees so it's  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:04):**  folded in from the outside in and then the whole thing will become you know more mixed more  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:10):**  homogenized and you will have worked a lot less you know because one of the big steps with the  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:15):**  straw is if you have a big tall pile of you know like sand soil mix and then you throw straw on it  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:22):**  and start stomping it in the more you add straw the harder it is to stomp so after a while towards  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:29):**  the end of that you're you know you've got a lot of resistance to to the work you're doing  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:33):**  so you want to avoid that resistance for as much as possible anyway I reduce steps again that's my  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:40):**  big one is just reduce it to the core of what's needed to get mixed wet enough can you know  
**[0:15:48-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:48):**  the soil clay soil crushed up enough and gooey enough and this you know with as little work as  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:15:56):**  possible as far as building with cob techniques to make it faster for building with cob I noticed  
**[0:16:04-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:04):**  if the cob is wetter it's easier to work it's much easier to get it onto a wall  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:12):**  and get it consolidated with the wall you know because you're working the wall into one piece  
**[0:16:17-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:17):**  as you go so you want to get the cob kind of wet so that it becomes one piece with the wall really  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:25):**  fast if it's too wet then you can't build in subsequent days you know you get the building  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:32):**  too high too fast and it'll slump at the bottom and so you don't want it too wet you need really  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:39):**  good drying conditions which I've got here in spades but see I have something I've noticed is  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:46):**  that when you work a wall the less pressure you have to put which is why I like it wet because  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:53):**  you could do you could work the piece together without a lot of pressure the less pressure I  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:16:58):**  apply to the wall the less pooching the wall does behind me you know because as you work in the new  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:03):**  stuff the stuff behind you kind of goes all over the place it's fat gets fat or the stuff below  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:08):**  you so standard cob procedure you know as taught by cob cottage was to take kind of dryish cob  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:15):**  you know as dry as possible because it's got to dry out later right and they're up in oregon so  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:19):**  this is what they teach it's wet up there you know and you shove you you work it down into the layers  
**[0:17:24-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:24):**  below well that dryish cob worked down thing it moves the wall a lot so you get a lot of  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:34):**  mushrooming they call it below so you have to saw off a lot or you know or trim a lot to keep your  
**[0:17:42-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:42):**  walls true and in my experience instead what I do is I use wetter stuff and I push horizontally  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:51):**  on the wall build up a little pile in front of me you know and then you're if you're pushing  
**[0:17:56-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:17:56):**  horizontally it mushrooms the wall below you less and so if you're building with wetter stuff I  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:03):**  found you could actually build faster with wet cob and higher in a day than you could with dry cob  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:09):**  it's just that you need good drying conditions you need subsequent days of really good drying  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:14):**  conditions to be able to continue building with really wet cob you know because I could do like  
**[0:18:20-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:20):**  three feet a day of wet cob if the drying conditions are good enough but if you do that  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:28):**  two three days in a row and you don't have the drying conditions then you're going to have some  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:35):**  serious problems now kirk you've given almost a decade to open source plans for rocket stoves and  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:41):**  rocket mass heaters what are some of the biggest advancements you've seen in this technology since  
**[0:18:46-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:46):**  you started working on it well I mean rocket stoves work now when I first got into it when I  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:18:54):**  built my first rocket stove they generally didn't work very well because we didn't really know what  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:01):**  it took to make them work right and I accidentally built one the reason why I got into rocket stoves  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:07):**  and I accidentally built one that worked pretty well and you know and I loved it and I went around  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:13):**  and talked to other people who had rocket stoves you know some of the other like first adapters and  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:19):**  they you know a lot of them most of them actually hated them and they didn't work very well at all  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:25):**  and they were taking them you know taking them out taking them back out installing wood stoves again  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:32):**  and I want you know I wanted to know why like why why does my stove work well  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:37):**  what did I do because it was you know totally accident that mine worked because we didn't know  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:42):**  how to make them work I just accidentally made one that did so anyway so so I got interested and  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:51):**  and other people were kind of had the same thought like oh wow look mine worked and I'm kind of  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:19:57):**  natural builder and I want to figure this out so like Ernie and Erica Wisner Ernie Wisner at least  
**[0:20:02-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:20:02):**  Ernie Wisner got in on the game and and so we did some research you know Ianto called me and Ernie  
**[0:20:11-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:20:11):**  and Leslie Jackson up to his place at one point in Cobb cottage and we sat down for two weeks  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:20:20):**  in the rain under kind of a halfway under a roof with water dripping down our necks for half the  
**[0:20:26-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:20:26):**  time and we broke and built built stoves until until we kind of figured out how to make them  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:20:34):**  sort of work and then and then Leslie and Ianto built wrote the first book the rocket stove  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:20:40):**  rocket stove not the red book but because they had a red kind of zine stapled together thing but the  
**[0:20:46-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:20:46):**  first edition of the rocket mass heaters book they built wrote that first edition off of what we  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:20:54):**  learned so from then on you know like we kind of could make rocket stoves work there were still  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:00):**  some details you know because occasionally occasionally we discovered that we actually  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:05):**  didn't well we actually subsequently discovered that we really didn't know that there was still  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:11):**  some things missing so after a couple years of fooling around you know we discovered some other  
**[0:21:17-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:17):**  things to make rocket stoves work so that was pretty exciting so the biggest change since  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:28):**  since I first got into rocket stoves is now they actually work but beyond that there's there's the  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:33):**  new batch box rocket stove system which is really cool it sort of solves a lot of the problems  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:39):**  remaining with why you would not want a rocket stove which is you know with a batch box you know  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:44):**  it's got a bigger fire box you could put regular split wood into it you know unlike you know  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:50):**  rocket stoves which you know you need little sticks and they're fiddly bits the batch rocket  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:21:57):**  you can you could see the fire really nicely you could put a window in it with glass put regular  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:04):**  wood in the training of other people isn't a big deal you know because it's kind of obvious how to  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:09):**  use it if you've used a regular wood stove you can probably do pretty good with a batch rocket  
**[0:22:16-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:16):**  we've got the efficiency of batch rockets and the the j-tube stoves up to like if you build it well  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:23):**  sort of an average of like 93 percent outside of the you know outside of the laboratory so  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:30):**  I mean we're seeing stoves that can run at 93 efficiency  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:35):**  outside of the laboratory which is unheard of you know so that's a big deal right there  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:44):**  I mean you know rocket stoves have changed so much they are I and I think they're really ready for  
**[0:22:49-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:49):**  for prime time you know for to to take out into the the prime time world you know general public  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:22:58):**  and introduce them you know I think I think they're mature enough now that they could be  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:04):**  made by a competent builder you know pretty much anywhere that's a big deal from not working to  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:12):**  yeah now for people who would like to experiment with and test their own rocket stoves and heaters  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:17):**  what metrics do you look for in making a stove more efficient  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:20):**  and how do you measure the performance of a stove  
**[0:23:24-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:24):**  well okay I try to stay away from numbers first of all so what I would say is build outside  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:34):**  first so if you want to build it in your house and you have sort of a corner or something I  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:38):**  would go outside and mock up the space where you want to build your stove and then you know it's  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:43):**  nice if you get outside under a covered roof you know like with a roof over you but you know you  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:48):**  want to be able to have just like open walls so so you're not going to breathe breathe noxious fumes  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:53):**  or anything you want a place that you can completely smoke out and you don't have to worry  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:23:57):**  about your health it could be inside a big barn it could be you know anyway so you go outside and  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:04):**  you build a mock-up of your space that you want to build the stove in and then just build like  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:08):**  build the stove build it out of materials that you can you could you know you like you're not  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:14):**  going to build it out of castable refractory in place out there that's an expensive proposition  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:19):**  but you could build the stove out of you know bricks and mud and the mud can be locally dug up  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:26):**  and sand and straw you know really build it and then troubleshoot it because you're going to run  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:31):**  into trouble you're going to run into problems it's not going to work for some reason so you  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:35):**  can take the barrel off and dig into this thing and find out what the problem is and and fix you  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:40):**  know so my advice is don't make your first installation or the first stove you build the  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:45):**  one inside your house or the you know indoors build a bunch of them outdoors first and find  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:24:53):**  out why they do and don't work you know you know and reading a book or going to the forums and  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:00):**  getting information is nice but but it really needs to click in your head to be able to build  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:07):**  effectively so that's what i recommend is i recommend the only way to really have the way  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:12):**  they the stoves work and the way you tune them down is to just do it and let it click in your  
**[0:25:18-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:18):**  head so find a place do some experiments you know try different things make and break a few stoves  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:30):**  and you know another thing that i like to do is i like to build the stoves while they're running so  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:34):**  i'll you know i like i'll use like adobes or or or or bricks or some kind of unit that i could build  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:41):**  very quickly with i got a lot of adobes around here because it's a school and i get people on  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:47):**  adobes early and we can use them to build boxes and things for stoves really fast benches and  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:25:54):**  things you know like you can do outer skin of a bench and then cob it up really beautifully  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:01):**  with adobes and get it done you know very quickly and have a full-on stove built in one day  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:08):**  so anyway i like to build that while the stove is running so that if for some reason it's not  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:15):**  going to work or i drop some cob in a pipe or somewhere or something like that you know  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:20):**  instantly you get instant feedback suddenly it stops working and you know and then you can go  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:25):**  find out why instead of you know building a full-on cob bench and a stove and and then  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:32):**  letting it dry first and then running it and then finding out it doesn't work  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:38):**  then you don't know where to start looking you know you basically got to chop the whole darn  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:43):**  thing open usually well i mean there's a couple places to look first but you know but it's better  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:49):**  it's best i think to build while the stove is running you know and then you could also tune  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:26:55):**  the stove itself and you could sort of learn you know tune it actively while it's running  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:01):**  um one of the ways that i've tested performance is just with my nose  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:08):**  you know just you could just smell what's coming out of the chimney pipe  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:12):**  there's a massive difference between a fire that's burning cleanly and a fire that's not  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:16):**  and your nose is accurate down to you know it's just about as good as a test dough you know you're  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:22):**  not going to get hard and fast numbers off of a nose read but you're going to be able to say wow  
**[0:27:28-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:28):**  that's running really clean or or not pretty quickly so yeah i would say trust your nose  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:36):**  and um and test a lot and just build a lot of stoves and build them while they're running  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:41):**  those are my three big ones okay now tell me what are some good resources that people can  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:46):**  look to in order to learn more about rocket stoves and heaters well they're the books there's uh  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:27:53):**  there's the um rocket stove book for um uh from yanto evans and leslie jackson the uh  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:00):**  how to build your own handmade oh no i'm sorry  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:05):**  oh my god i'm blanking  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:10):**  it's the rocket mask heaters book by leslie jackson and yanto evans and then there's a new  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:15):**  rocket mask heaters book how to build book by ernie and erica wisner i recommend those books  
**[0:28:23-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:23):**  ernie and erica wisner i recommend those books for sure also you know everything can be found  
**[0:28:31-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:31):**  free of charge at um at the forum donkey32.proboards.com  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:41):**  that's a great one there's a really good community there and um the there's active  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:46):**  development happening all the time so a lot of the new cutting edge stuff is happening there  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:50):**  the there's also the forums over at um at permies.com there's a fire into the forum  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:28:57):**  and ernie and erica wisner are there and they're really sharp as well and you can ask questions  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:03):**  at rocketstoves.com to leslie jackson and she can help field questions now you and i were talking  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:10):**  the other day about one of the articles that i wrote called the real cost of natural building  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:14):**  that aims to give a more realistic look at what you should expect to pay for a natural structure  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:19):**  even if you build it yourself for anyone who's interested in reading the full article you can  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:22):**  find it on the website at abundantedge.com under the news section but anyway you had some really  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:28):**  good feedback and observations on that topic would you mind going over some of those again  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:33):**  yeah yeah yeah okay so what really struck me about your article  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:37):**  oliver is that it was honest um i think that we've gotten sort of this  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:43):**  you know natural builders have been really triumphalist over the years we've got a good  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:46):**  thing going you know and um we've said you know anybody can do it and anybody can do it out of  
**[0:29:52-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:29:52):**  pocket and so this is cheap uh and and objectively sort of i mean there's two ways to look at that  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:30:02):**  i think that but but you know that's true enough as it is you you can  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:30:07):**  reasonably expect as somebody who works a regular job or maybe even two regular jobs you know like  
**[0:30:14-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:30:14):**  everybody has to work these days to keep things down to build your own small dwelling and i do  
**[0:30:24-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:30:24):**  mean small um you can reasonably expect to do that and you could reasonably be expected to to  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:30:32):**  in subsequent years with the same crummy jobs um to add on to that small small small dwelling  
**[0:30:39-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:30:39):**  you know subsequent staged expansions in you know small expansions but which is sort of a pattern  
**[0:30:47-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:30:47):**  that we advocate for but um and you could do that out of pocket you know and you know like a like a  
**[0:30:56-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:30:56):**  200 square foot space could easily cost less than a thousand dollars in materials right but but you  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:04):**  know i think that we've we've given we've done a disservice to um the the general community out  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:10):**  there by by being triumphalist and couching it in the terms that we've couched it in over the years  
**[0:31:16-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:16):**  if anybody can do this and it's cheap well okay how much is your target and how much is your  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:23):**  time worth uh because i recently had somebody get the idea that it was cheap and they were going to  
**[0:31:29-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:29):**  hire me to come build them a cob house because it was cheap and it doesn't actually work that way  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:36):**  if you hire me to build you a cob house you're going to pay for labor because building one of  
**[0:31:42-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:42):**  these things is you know it's immensely labor intensive um you know and i'm going to charge  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:50):**  you know 40 or 50 bucks an hour for my time here in the states uh  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:31:57):**  you know and anybody who's working with me is going to get between 20 you know 20 and 30  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:02):**  dollars an hour here in california and um you know so a crew of three is going to cost you a lot of  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:10):**  money per day and you know cob is heavily labor intensive you don't go to the lumber store and  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:16):**  pick up a bag of ready-made cob you go out and you dig up stuff and you know and you you pick  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:22):**  out the big rocks and the big you know whatever is in there and you you know you mix it up yourself  
**[0:32:28-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:28):**  so so yeah no you're not going to save a dime not a single dime and it might actually cost you more  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:35):**  to have a natural building built for you um and you know it's a big shock to people or it has i  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:42):**  have experienced that people in the past have been utterly shocked when they realized that hiring me  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:48):**  was going to cost them something um when when the word on the street is and the word in the books is  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:32:55):**  that um you know it's it's cheap it's cheap and anybody can do it  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:02):**  you know so so both can be true anyway so i think that that what i like about your website is that  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:09):**  um it says that straight up it's honest what's your time worth man you know okay yeah it's only  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:14):**  a thousand dollars worth of materials but it's going to be you know the next year of your life  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:18):**  or two years of your life or how you know it's serious hours of your life um and hard labor and  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:25):**  good and a lot of sweat so you know if you if you if you don't forget to account for that early up  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:32):**  really early on in the process um to not give yourself too many you know unrealistic expectations  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:38):**  about what you're going to get so let's switch for a second here over to a more optimistic topic  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:44):**  after getting into all the um slightly discouraging aspects of you know the real cost of natural  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:50):**  building what are some of the things that have gotten you really inspired lately in the world of  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:55):**  natural building and design well the first thing is that you know you're going to have to be  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:33:59):**  more conscious about the world of natural building and design well i mean you know i think an  
**[0:34:04-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:04):**  important thing to remember is that yeah it's really labor intensive you know um but you can  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:12):**  own it yourself and and you can build it for yourself any place and so if you're down with  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:19):**  the philosophy and you don't get hung up on well that's not out of mud that's not cob you know that  
**[0:34:24-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:24):**  stuff you know you can you can actually repurpose recycled materials and you know like take pallets  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:32):**  and screw them together and stuff straw or or even like if you have a large amount of it old  
**[0:34:38-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:38):**  t-shirts or clothes or you know chopped chopped brush or anything down inside of those pallets  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:46):**  and you know you can take an earth mixture uh make a big earth plaster and plaster over those pallets  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:52):**  and disappear all that stuff and put together you know an actual tiny tiny tiny little shelter for  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:34:59):**  next to nothing and you know and i could take some of the dirt off the ground and mix it with  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:04):**  a little bit of sand over there and maybe a little straw or manure and i can make adobe bricks and  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:09):**  with those bricks i can build a stove that's just as efficient as its nearest competitor which is  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:14):**  ten thousand dollars that's a big masonry stove i could build a stove that's just as efficient as a  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:20):**  masonry stove for less than 100 bucks if i'm willing to do the labor myself that's the deal  
**[0:35:25-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:25):**  is the labor um you know so on an optimistic tone uh there's no need if you're aware of natural  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:35):**  building or whatnot that you need to be an uncomfortable homeless person as long as you're  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:41):**  not run out of the hovel that you make you can make even a hovel with your own bare hands and  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:47):**  a reasonable amount of time and be very comfortable any place and i think that's  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:35:53):**  important that's something that we've been missing uh in our modern world is we don't have  
**[0:36:00-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:00):**  you know we don't have direct control over uh shelter uh or clothing or uh our basic needs  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:10):**  and um it feels very liberating to be able to take direct control over some of your basic needs  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:16):**  and natural building building building really allows that with a very important part of our  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:20):**  aspect of our lives which is shelter so now tell me where or how do you see the world of natural  
**[0:36:26-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:26):**  building advancing and progressing in the years to come well i mean as it stands right now at  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:33):**  least in the united states and most of the places in the united states anyway and you know in a lot  
**[0:36:38-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:38):**  of places all over the world england europe uh you know there's uh building codes don't have cob in  
**[0:36:47-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:47):**  um and or or or other natural building techniques you know part of the problem is um oh i don't know  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:36:55):**  insurance you know liability is part of the issue and so building with non-standard materials is  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:37:01):**  typically frowned on and you know most places with with strict building codes and maybe rightfully so  
**[0:37:09-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:37:09):**  you know um but you know i think our interface with uh with the building departments wherever  
**[0:37:19-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:37:19):**  we are has to be um well thought out and um you know and we have to go go to our building  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:37:27):**  officials well informed and um you know to be able to really help them with the understanding  
**[0:37:34-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:37:34):**  of what it is that we're doing and we need to go on a sort of a regime of exploration to  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:37:42):**  quantify some numbers about uh what we're doing or quantify not just numbers you know of the  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:37:49):**  materials themselves you know compressive strength and in sheer strength and you know in ways of  
**[0:37:55-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:37:55):**  but also quantifying um procedures i would say uh because a lot of natural building is about  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:02):**  procedure rather than a particular you know because every shovel full of dirt from one place  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:07):**  or another even if they're very close to each other they're a little different so you know if  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:12):**  i dig 10 in two places 10 feet apart i'm going to have a slightly different quantity of sand say or  
**[0:38:18-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:18):**  aggregate in in my mix so you know i have to be awake to that and alter how much i would add after  
**[0:38:26-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:26):**  that so the point being that that it's a process rather than you know that would be um somehow  
**[0:38:36-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:36):**  finding a way to permit and allow a process that creates a range of possible positive outcomes  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:44):**  rather than what you know the building department focuses on which is direct stress tests of a given  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:49):**  known material um which can get really expensive when every single mix is different so could you  
**[0:38:56-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:38:56):**  imagine you know like having to test every mix before you can use it um or from every region or  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:03):**  area before you can use it it's subjecting it to you know anyway it can get very expensive fast  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:09):**  and in order to keep that sort of re-indigenous concept and interface with the building department  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:15):**  um that's sort of the angle that i'd like to approach it at because you know you can take  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:20):**  a building you know like a thousand dollars in building materials i keep saying you know with  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:25):**  maybe 20 or 30 thousand dollars worth of my own effort and and help and effort from friends  
**[0:39:31-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:31):**  um so that versus a thirty thousand dollar uh building like permit  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:41):**  you know so we got to find a way to to not have a five thousand dollar house  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:48):**  with maybe ten thousand dollars worth of you know a value of labor in it or twenty thousand  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:52):**  dollars with a value of labor in it and pay thirty five thousand dollars with for the permit to build  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:39:57):**  it that's sort of out of scale it doesn't make sense there there's got to be a way  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:40:02):**  there's got to be a way in there so that that so that the permitting process is to scale and more  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:40:07):**  permissible anyway i think i babbled on that one long enough okay now before you go how can people  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:40:14):**  learn a bit more about the sundog school of natural building and your work uh you go to our  
**[0:40:19-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:40:19):**  website www.sundogbuilders.net and you can see a little bit about us there you can email me at info  
**[0:40:31-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-009-kirk-donkey-mobert-coming-soon/#t=0:40:31):**  at sundogbuilders.net we do have a facebook page sundog space builders uh i think it's sundog space

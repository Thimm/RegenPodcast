**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:40):**  New Society Publishers is proud to be celebrating 40 years of activist, solutions-oriented publishing.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:46):**  From our roots in non-violent civil disobedience training during the Vietnam War to today with  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:51):**  over 500 books published, some across a dozen languages, we continue to bring positive solutions  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:00:57):**  and cutting edge ideas to some of the most troubling challenges of our time.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:02):**  Having never wavered from our mission to help build a just and ecologically sustainable  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:06):**  society placing planet and people before profit, we are proud to hold the highest environmental  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:12):**  and social standards of any publisher in North America.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:16):**  With a dedicated community of change makers and thought leaders always working ahead of  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:20):**  the curve, we look forward to another 40 years of bringing our readers books for a world  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:25):**  of change.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:29):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:32):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:38):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:41):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:45):**  fields around the world and working with clients and organizations to help them reach their  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:49):**  regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that anyone  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:54):**  can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves, their families  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:01:59):**  and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:03):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:07):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:09):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:13):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.

**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:23):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:29):**  As I've been slowly becoming better connected here in Spain over the last year, one of the  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:32):**  main projects in regenerative agriculture that keeps coming up in my research and the  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:36):**  conversations that I have is a fairly new project called Albelal, which is located in  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:41):**  southern Spain, roughly between the cities of Granada and Murcia.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:46):**  Now the name Albelal relates to the first letters of the comarcas, or counties, where  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:51):**  the initiative started, which are the Altiplano de Granada, Los Belles, and Alto al Mansora.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:02:58):**  Today, the Albelal territory covers more than a million hectares of degraded steppe known  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:03):**  as the Altiplano Estepario.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:06):**  Now I first found a connection with this organization through some other work that I was doing to  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:10):**  help consult on the ecosystem restoration camp known as Camp Altiplano, which is actually  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:15):**  a 5 hectare portion of the largest farm in the organization where they're trialing  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:20):**  various agroforestry and holistic grazing techniques in an effort to restore the degraded  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:25):**  site through economically viable production methods.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:28):**  The coordinator of the camp who I'd been in touch with connected me with the owner  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:32):**  of the larger farm, who also happens to be the president of Albelal, Alfonso Chico de  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:37):**  Guzm√°n.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:38):**  Now, Alfonso is a unique example of a young man who decided to return to his origins on  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:43):**  land and to help his family farm after graduating with a degree in business administration.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:48):**  He then immediately dedicated himself to transforming the farm through innovative and regenerative  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:53):**  methods and to set up an organic market garden as well as fruit production, and began to  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:03:58):**  develop agroforestry methods through systems involving almonds and pistachios specifically.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:03):**  He's also implemented broad water harvesting earthworks with swales on contour and keyline  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:09):**  ponds in order to help restore the watershed of this parched and arid region.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:14):**  Aided now by a team of international nonprofit organizations, he's become instrumental  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:19):**  in showcasing and pioneering many dryland agricultural best practices and to help to  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:24):**  motivate other producers in the region to follow suit.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:28):**  In this episode, we talk about many of the methods that I glossed over just now, as well  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:32):**  as the overall response from the community in this transition.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:37):**  We also discuss barriers to progress and the challenges and roadblocks that he and others  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:41):**  have faced in transitioning their farms, as well as some of the successes along the way.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:46):**  I was really excited to tap into such an inspiring movement and am really looking forward to  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:50):**  working more actively both with Arderal and ecosystem restoration camps here in Spain  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:55):**  as these projects continue to grow.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:04:58):**  So look out for updates in future episodes if you enjoy this talk, and from here I'll  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:03):**  hand things over now to Alfonso.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:05):**  Hey Alfonso, thanks so much for taking time to speak with me today.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:09):**  I've been excited to talk to you for a while.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:11):**  You are helping to coordinate one of the most impressive regenerative agriculture projects  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:16):**  in Spain.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:18):**  But how are you doing today in general?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:20):**  Hello Oliver, it's a pleasure to be in the interview.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:25):**  And well, thanks for your kind words.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:28):**  Yeah, today, well, it's, yeah, I don't know what to answer to that.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:36):**  It's a challenging day, yeah, we were talking earlier.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:40):**  It's a bit of a, for no reason in particular, a bit of a challenging day indeed.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:46):**  But for, yeah, in general, it's good.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:50):**  I think projects are going well.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:53):**  It's a beautiful sunny day.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:54):**  So yeah, it's a good day.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:57):**  Focus on the positive.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:05:59):**  So look, before we start going into the details of the Avela project, why don't you tell our  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:06):**  listeners a little bit about your personal background and how you started to work in  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:10):**  agriculture in Spain.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:11):**  So I grew up in a family that we, my father and his father, we were all involved in farming.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:21):**  And that's, yeah, that's how we were making a living off.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:26):**  Although it was more from the managerial side of it, more from the office and not so much  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:31):**  in the land.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:33):**  And then after studying my university, I studied business administration.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:40):**  And I thought that there was a lot of things that could be experimented and room for improvement  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:46):**  in the farm.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:48):**  Yeah, in the strategy in general and trying to make it more sustainable so it could be  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:06:56):**  farmed for the next generations that they could do a bit the same as we did because  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:04):**  what we were seeing that it was degrading quite fast.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:07):**  And it was not so clear if the next generations were going to be able to make a living from  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:12):**  farming, at least not in our farm.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:15):**  I decided to move there and started experimenting on a little plot, more with vegetables and  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:23):**  fruit trees.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:24):**  And then from then on, I started getting more and more experience.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:27):**  And most of the experiments didn't work, but some of the experiments did work.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:31):**  I think that's, that's in general how experiments go.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:35):**  And then started applying them more on a larger scale.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:38):**  And then started getting involved with more organizations, getting to know more people,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:45):**  trying to get knowledge from their experiences.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:49):**  And yeah, I think that's a bit the situation where we are now that is a farm where there's  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:07:56):**  quite a big diversity of crops and projects going on.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:00):**  Well, so to give everyone sort of an idea of the context that you're working in, can  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:05):**  you describe the Altiplano and Southeastern regions of Spain and especially why they're  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:11):**  in desperate need of restoration at this point?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:15):**  So the Altiplano area where the farm and the ecosystem restoration camp Altiplano are located  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:23):**  is in the Southeast of Spain.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:25):**  So it's inland about a hundred and something kilometers, kilometers from the sea, from  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:31):**  the Mediterranean Sea.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:33):**  And it's an average of about a thousand meters over sea level.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:37):**  So it's, it's weather, the climate that is not so easy for farming in general or for  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:46):**  restoring doesn't make things easy because it's quite cold in the winter.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:50):**  So we have freezing temperatures from October until May, especially at night.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:08:55):**  But then we have also very hot summers that we can get to 40 degrees in the summer.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:01):**  And the average rainfall in my farm is about 310 millimeters.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:08):**  And in other areas it can be lower and in other areas a bit higher.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:11):**  But in general it's quite dry Mediterranean climate with cold winters.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:18):**  And so how has the land sort of gotten to the point where it is now?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:22):**  Because it didn't always used to look like a desert.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:26):**  No, indeed.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:28):**  Well, it looked more like a oak tree forest a couple of thousand years ago.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:35):**  And it looked more like a steep step, how do you call it, like in Mongolia, like, yeah,  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:44):**  a couple of thousand years more ago because apparently it was too cold for trees.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:50):**  So what I think is a landscape that has always been changing, but through agriculture, that's  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:09:57):**  when it changed faster and in many areas it got degraded quite fast.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:04):**  And I think it's basically because of applying same techniques as in other parts, but that  
**[0:10:09-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:09):**  they don't really fit very well here or they are quite extractive and destructive here.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:18):**  I think mainly it was about cutting down the trees, then especially cutting down the trees  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:25):**  and doing farming on steep parts and slopes and then overgrazing with sheep and doing  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:32):**  that for a few hundred years, I think, brought us in the situation that we are now.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:38):**  Now I'd love to break down some of the experiments and the trials and errors that you've had.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:43):**  But before we do that, can you describe who Albelal is?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:47):**  What is this project and how have all these different people and organizations come together  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:52):**  with this idea of restoring the land of this brittle area through regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:10:59):**  techniques?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:00):**  Yeah, it's a long story that I'm going to see if I can summarize it in an understandable  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:07):**  way.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:08):**  But it started with the help and with the visit of the Kombaland Foundation that they  
**[0:11:16-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:16):**  wanted to fund projects that were interested in doing large scale ecosystem restoration  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:24):**  through regenerative agriculture, through business cases that were sustainable and following  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:29):**  that framework of the four returns.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:33):**  That is the environmental, social, economic and inspirational.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:38):**  And then they met the group of people that were in this territory and this group of people  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:46):**  that were mainly farmers and other entrepreneurs that were already doing efforts in this type  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:53):**  of agriculture and in ecosystem restoration.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:11:57):**  They decided to group together and develop this project.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:04):**  This was about five something years ago.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:09):**  Since then, that group of people have been increasing.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:11):**  Now there is about 300 members and many of them are farmers or landowners or involved  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:20):**  in one way or another with regenerative agriculture and ecosystem restoration.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:26):**  Yeah, there's a team.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:31):**  It's managed by Albelalis and the legal entities and association.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:36):**  It also has a team of people working in it that they help out, develop the projects,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:43):**  help out farmers with advice, soil analysis, consultancy.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:12:53):**  It's about a million hectares more or less the territory that the association is working  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:00):**  in.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:01):**  That doesn't mean that all the hectares are participating, but that's the goal of it and  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:06):**  that to try to have an impact on all of them in 20 years.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:12):**  And then that's where my farm is and that's also where the camp Alpiplano is located.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:18):**  So through common land, John DeLeu came on a visit and then he proposed that it would  
**[0:13:25-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:25):**  be nice if it would be interesting for us to host one ecosystem restoration camp in  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:34):**  one of the plots of the farm that we had some plans of doing some projects.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:38):**  And then, yeah, I think we had a good connection.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:41):**  We agreed that that would be a good idea.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:46):**  That's where the camp project has been going for the last three and a half years, more  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:54):**  or less three years and a few months.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:13:58):**  It's more in, has been focusing on having those five hectares of land and combining  
**[0:14:06-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:06):**  many of the techniques of ecosystem restoration, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, well,  
**[0:14:15-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:15):**  different ideas, different options of how to restore a piece of land and hosting volunteers  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:25):**  for helping out in the larger area of the territory with reforestation, mainly unnatural  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:32):**  areas, also learning about natural building and setting up the facilities like the infrastructure  
**[0:14:39-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:39):**  of the camp and the buildings with carpentry.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:46):**  And yeah, that's more or less, I don't know if I was able to summarize it.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:52):**  For sure, for sure.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:53):**  And like you said, there is a lot going on.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:55):**  There's many different elements to this.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:14:58):**  And I've been in touch with Sylvia, who's managing the Altiplano camp, which is part  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:02):**  of your land as well.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:04):**  Can you tell me now some of the objectives and the techniques that are being implemented  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:09):**  right now to include sort of a farming profit in with the idea of restoring these lands  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:16):**  to better ecological health?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:19):**  OK.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:21):**  So I think, for example, in the plot of the camp, most of the practices, I think that's  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:27):**  especially interesting because most of them are being applied in that five hectares plot  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:32):**  because many of these techniques, they're applied in one farm or another or like two  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:36):**  of these in this plot and one on another.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:39):**  But I think the interesting thing about the camp as well is that most of them are all  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:43):**  concentrated in one plot.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:44):**  And you can see them all at the same time.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:46):**  Those go are from swales that are these trenches that follow the contour lines that help infiltration  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:54):**  of water and reduce the erosion.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:15:58):**  Then there are trees.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:01):**  So for agroforestry, there is trees, mainly almond trees, but also some others in combination  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:09):**  with ground cover.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:11):**  Then there's an area of just pasture.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:14):**  There are a couple of sediment traps.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:17):**  There are also some ponds that have water permanently.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:21):**  There is a fruit tree area as well.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:25):**  And the things we do from the ground cover to managing that ground cover with holistic  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:37):**  management of grazing with a breed of the first year was with sheep.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:43):**  And then this year with a small number of cows that with a fence, they go between the  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:52):**  areas so they don't eat the trees.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:16:57):**  Well the ponds that are quite self-explanatory, the benefits of ponds, there are many they  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:04):**  go from not only improving biodiversity, but also helping infiltrate the water, receiving  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:09):**  the runoff, reducing the erosion.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:13):**  And then there are kind of an oasis in the middle of the desert because there's not many  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:18):**  places where you can see surface water here.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:21):**  And they help also refill the aquifers.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:26):**  So when there's big rain events on the area of the camp, there used to be a storm where  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:35):**  it has a water catchment of more than 250 hectares.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:38):**  And then the soil would not be able on that water catchment to absorb all the water.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:45):**  And there would be a river literally of millions of liters of water going through in a few  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:51):**  minutes or in a few hours.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:53):**  And now with all these sets of ponds, many times we're able to capture and infiltrate  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:17:59):**  slowly that water.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:01):**  In fact, we've managed to have a little stream of water going on for most of the year, depending  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:10):**  on how dry or rainy the year is.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:13):**  But it flows between six and nine months a year, which is really, really nice to see  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:20):**  something.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:21):**  Yeah, that's a dramatic change for that area.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:25):**  And to think that, so these methods have mostly just been implemented on this one five hectare  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:30):**  spot, correct?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:33):**  So in between all the members of Albelal and all the farms that are involved, you see how  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:38):**  all of these techniques have been implemented in a lot of these farms.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:45):**  But in the camp, they have all been implemented there combined.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:50):**  Also compost, also, well, I probably I'm missing some of them, but yeah.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:18:58):**  Now it's really exciting to have sort of a test place like that, where you can try all  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:03):**  these things and then start to implement them on a larger plots for the farmers themselves.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:08):**  And what have been some of these techniques that have been most embraced by the farmers  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:13):**  of this area and that they've seen the best results from?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:17):**  The ponds, for example, that's something that has been quite embraced.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:21):**  And those were the first ponds that were made in the area.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:27):**  And now, I don't know the exact number, but I think the number can be close to 100 ponds  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:34):**  that have been made.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:35):**  No, I think more than 100 ponds have been made lately in the last three years.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:41):**  And I think definitely those ponds at camp have been quite inspirational for that and  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:47):**  have helped people to see the results and to see the importance of it.  
**[0:19:51-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:19:51):**  Swales also, I think at camp there are some, but the thing is that you don't see a lot  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:00):**  the effect because there's quite a thick layer of vegetation.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:05):**  So there's not that much runoff and the swales don't get filled up, which is actually good.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:11):**  But then it's difficult to see the effect of them that on the rest of the farm, you  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:17):**  can see how when it rains, they do get full quite fast.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:22):**  And also now there are, I think almost 100 kilometers of swales in different farms of  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:28):**  different members of Albelal.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:32):**  The combination of that ground cover with compost, that is something also that some  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:38):**  more people are applying, but just as a grazing concept because there's like really nice pasture  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:46):**  coming out that we thought that that would not really be possible with our climate and  
**[0:20:50-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:50):**  our soils, but it is with a combination of wild seeds and legumes and compost.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:20:59):**  But for example, what we've seen is that having the agroforestry system since trying to make  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:06):**  it happen from the beginning of buying trees from the nursery and putting them in holes  
**[0:21:13-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:13):**  and having a ground cover of thick vegetation all year round, we've seen that that's very  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:21):**  challenging for trees.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:22):**  So the soil is good and the vegetation is good, but the trees struggle to survive.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:28):**  Many needed irrigation, others were not able to survive and the ones that do, they are  
**[0:21:35-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:35):**  not developing very fast, while the ones that are tilled either little or very intensively,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:45):**  the soil is more exposed and it's not so benefit, but the trees do develop faster.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:51):**  So also I think it is important to have the examples of both what works and what doesn't  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:57):**  work.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:21:58):**  And I think the camp also is a good place to have both and maintain them for a couple  
**[0:22:03-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:03):**  of years so people can see the successes and the struggles and the lessons learned.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:13):**  Many times when it happens in another plot, what doesn't work, then that's removed and  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:18):**  you cannot really see it and then it's easy for the next person to make the same mistake  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:23):**  again.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:24):**  But I think it's especially useful that here that you can see it with your own eyes.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:28):**  Yeah, that was one of the main things that I was speaking to the other day with Sylvia  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:32):**  about is the tree planting techniques and how it's been somewhat counterintuitive thinking  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:37):**  that putting ground covers and having more organic matter would be better for the trees.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:42):**  But in this case, it hasn't worked out kind of the way that that experiment was intending  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:46):**  to prove.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:47):**  But it's important, like you said, to show both sides.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:50):**  And you might have an idea about what works, but this is exactly why experiments are done  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:22:56):**  so that we don't have to guess and we can actually show it through action like that.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:00):**  And that's really cool.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:02):**  I know that tree crops are a big part of the economy and the potential economy of that  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:07):**  area that can serve a ton of other ecosystem functions as well.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:12):**  What are some of the main tree crops that are being trialed and implemented on the farms  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:16):**  in that area?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:18):**  It's mainly almond trees.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:23):**  It's an area that has had this crop of like a few thousands of hectares of almond trees  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:34):**  already for a few decades.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:37):**  They adapt quite well, but it is a challenge to do it in a way that is also sustainable  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:44):**  and that is they don't receive an intensive tilling in some farms.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:50):**  They are used to do eight times a year, which is what we've seen.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:23:54):**  It's not good for the soil clearly, but it's not even good for the trees.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:01):**  Then the other extreme would be to never till, which seems to be good for the soil, but not  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:08):**  so good for the trees, at least in the first years.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:13):**  And yeah, that's one of the things that we are experimenting the most and sharing the  
**[0:24:17-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:17):**  most knowledge and understanding how it happens and how the trees and the soil behave in different  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:25):**  types of soils, different types of management.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:29):**  But that's the main crop tree-wise.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:32):**  There's also some areas with a lot of olive trees and slowly also you see more and more  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:38):**  plantations of pistachios.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:41):**  So this being sort of the main crop implemented in a lot of these areas, which is fantastic  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:46):**  that it's a perennial and that it has all of these benefits for the ecosystem as well.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:52):**  But have you started to stack enterprises within this system, like running silvopasture  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:24:57):**  with animals in between the tree rows or intercropping in between the lanes?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:04):**  Yeah, so some things are already implemented for a few years.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:10):**  Other things are still in an experimental phase.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:13):**  But for example, in Albelal, we tried to promote that people leave a ground cover at least  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:22):**  during the cold and humid months of the year between the trees.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:26):**  That means from October until March, April, depending on how the year is.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:31):**  And then it's also promoted that ground cover is grazed during the winter with the sheep.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:38):**  So that's something that it was not very common to do before, only in very few farms that  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:44):**  was happening.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:45):**  And now it's something that you see happening more and more often.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:48):**  And you see that it's clearly a benefit for the soil and a benefit for the trees and a  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:52):**  benefit for the economy as well.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:54):**  It's an extra income that you have.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:25:57):**  So that is something that is definitely happening.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:01):**  Another thing that you see happening more and more is leaving after March when all that  
**[0:26:07-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:07):**  vegetation is incorporated in soil by tilling in some parts to live in the middle of the  
**[0:26:15-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:15):**  land at least two meters wide where the vegetation is left there, is not incorporated.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:23):**  And that we've seen also, we can kind of prove after a couple of years in a row that that's  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:32):**  also beneficial for the soil and for the trees.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:34):**  I think a lot of these things take a couple of years to demonstrate that it's working  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:39):**  not just because it was a rainy year or because it was a dry year or because of this type  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:44):**  of soil or because of these circumstances, but that it consistently works in most of  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:52):**  the situations.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:53):**  Well, that's really the trick, isn't it?  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:26:56):**  When you're doing experiments like this with slower maturing systems like tree systems  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:01):**  and with all of the different variables that come in from the weather patterns from year  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:05):**  to year, it can be really difficult to show that what you've implemented is really working  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:10):**  because of the way you implemented it or the way the experiment was run and not just an  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:16):**  anomaly from these other factors.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:17):**  And it's like you said, it does it takes a while to really get to the bottom of whether  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:23):**  this is worth repeating or this was just something that got lucky because there was more rainfall  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:28):**  this year, for example, or it was dry and this was a benefit to the particular circumstances.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:35):**  How long would you say you like to leave things before feeling confident about giving recommendations  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:41):**  on systems like this?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah, we try to wait five years.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:45):**  So we try to be careful in that.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:48):**  And even when we try something and it seems to be a success, we try to wait five years  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:27:54):**  to confirm that it works and before recommending it to the rest of the people.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:01):**  Because yeah, otherwise, if we make official recommendations to other farmers, and it's  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:06):**  something that we'd work one year or it worked in one farm, but it doesn't work in the rest,  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:12):**  then it's it takes a lot of time to gain your credibility, but you can lose it quite fast.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:18):**  You can make a mistake on one of those things.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:23):**  And I mean, five years is quite a chunk of time.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:27):**  How are you helping these farmers to transition even before you're really confident about  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:32):**  the methods that you're able to recommend?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:34):**  Are there things that just about anybody can get started with that will have an effect  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:38):**  on positive management for the ecosystem?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:41):**  Or is it really worth waiting until these things can be demonstrated more concretely?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:47):**  Well, there are a couple of methods and a couple of techniques that are very clear that  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:53):**  they work very well.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:28:55):**  That's something that we are already recommending most of the farmers from the very beginning.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:01):**  One thing is to apply compost.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:03):**  And that's something that is also a technique that is adopted very fast by most of the farmers  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:13):**  because it's an investment that you see the results within the same year.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:18):**  And they see the benefits and the economic benefits because they increase the yields  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:23):**  within a few months.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:25):**  And that also stays in the soil that it's good for the next years.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:32):**  And also when you do a soil analysis after a few years of applying compost, you can see  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:37):**  it.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:38):**  So that one is quite easy to do.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:42):**  The ponds also is something that we recommend from the beginning.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:46):**  That's something that you don't see the economic benefits so fast, but you do see all the others  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:53):**  really, really fast.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:29:56):**  And then the ground cover that is during those months of winter.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:02):**  That's also that we recommend from the very beginning.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:05):**  And the grazing of the sheep, it depends on the sheep and on the separate to make sure  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:08):**  that there's no goats involved because then those goats, they will start also biting a  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:15):**  lot of trees.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:16):**  And we tried with cows, but we saw also that the trees, unless they are very big, they  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:22):**  get destroyed quite fast.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:24):**  But with the variety of sheep that we have in the area, it works really well.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:29):**  And also through a cooperative that we have that is called the Almondresa.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:35):**  So it's a mix between the almonds and the VESA system.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:39):**  That's what we are trying to go towards.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:42):**  That is selling these products of almonds that are from these farms that are applying  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:49):**  all these regenerative agriculture techniques.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:53):**  And then they're selling at a premium price that the farmers can use back that extra price  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:30:59):**  to invest it back in applying these practices in their farms.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:04):**  So let's say that the clients are financing the restoration of those plots.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:09):**  That's really exciting.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:10):**  And that was actually one of the things that I would love to go into more detail about  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:13):**  is how this affects the economy of the farmers.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:17):**  Because, you know, first of all, it takes a while for a slower maturing system like  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:21):**  this to get established.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:24):**  And there's a down period before they're producing when they still need to be making money and  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:29):**  be able to invest in these processes.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:32):**  First of all, what are some of the ways that they can keep the money flowing until the  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:37):**  trees have matured?  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:39):**  And what are sort of the promises of returns that help them get a higher market value because  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:45):**  of the better methods that they're using?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:49):**  So for the second part, the market is there.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:52):**  So now it's quite clear it's big and there is a high demand.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:31:57):**  Actually, we have kind of a problem that is not really a problem.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:02):**  We don't have enough supply for all the clients that are willing to buy these products, these  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:09):**  almonds.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:10):**  But now also we are doing it with honey, with olive oil, and we are starting to get into  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:15):**  the aromatics as well.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:17):**  So basically all the products that come out from that system.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:23):**  And also we want to do it with the lamps as well.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:27):**  But that's a bit of a more difficult one to get to the final client with lamps.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:35):**  But we're working on it.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:38):**  That one, well the farmers, they see the benefit from the beginning.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:41):**  So they know that to have a field fully restored is going to take many, many, many years.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:49):**  But with this system that the client is financing the restoration of it, then that's a really  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:55):**  good way to do it.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:32:56):**  Because otherwise it's very difficult for a farmer that many times is already struggling  
**[0:33:01-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:01):**  to survive that year to ask them to make a large investment in all the land to restore  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:08):**  it.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:09):**  So this system is being quite successful and it's very well received by the clients and  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:15):**  also very well received by the farmers that they are quite happy with it.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:21):**  You asked this and the other one, the first one.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:26):**  How are they able to make that leap to these slower maturing systems with other, I guess,  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:35):**  shorter term investments?  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:36):**  Are they producing annuals?  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:38):**  Are they relying on outside funding?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:41):**  Most of the farms have other varieties of crops.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:46):**  And also we try to promote that people don't get monocultures and that even if one crop  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:51):**  is now more profitable than others, that farmers don't get the temptation to just plant everything  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:33:58):**  of one thing.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:00):**  And most of the farmers actually, yeah, they have a farm that is diversified.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:06):**  They have almonds, they have grains and many have sheep as well.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:12):**  So that's quite a common one to see.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:14):**  But there's also more and more aromatics, more and more pistachios, some olive trees  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:18):**  as well.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:20):**  And that's also a source of income that you have some things that give you in short term,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:28):**  others medium term, others long term.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:30):**  And if you want to change the whole farm to trees from grains, from annuals to perennials,  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:37):**  then you either have a lot of money or you either get a very big loan because it's difficult  
**[0:34:43-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:43):**  to survive the five or six or seven years that the trees of the time that they take  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:53):**  to start giving proper yields.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:34:57):**  Given all of these benefits and the fact that you can demand much higher prices at market  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:01):**  for crops that are produced in this way, what are the barriers for other producers and getting  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:07):**  people interested in these methods?  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:09):**  Is there still some pushback from the community and from the industry at large or is it just  
**[0:35:14-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:14):**  a matter of the time it takes to get these types of new systems established?  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:21):**  Well, you always have the early adopters and people that are more innovative and they are  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:27):**  interested in also very interested in the environmental part of it and that they do  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:33):**  it even if it's knowing that it's not easy or even if it wouldn't be profitable or even  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:38):**  if it takes a long time.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:40):**  And then you have other people that have different mindsets for whatever reasons.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:44):**  You have also people that have been doing something in one way during their whole lives  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:49):**  and they're about to retire and then they are not very interested in changing their  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:53):**  whole system in their last years and complicate themselves so much.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:35:59):**  Also there are some people that they need to see it with their own eyes and they need  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:04):**  to see the results from a neighbour that is very nearby otherwise they are quite sceptical  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:11):**  and I think it's totally fair that they say yeah that works there but that soil is a bit  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:18):**  different and the rainfall is a bit different or the circumstance whatever is different  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:22):**  so they want to see it happening and working nearby.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:26):**  And another thing is that the trust also with who you're selling that some people are doing  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:38):**  something with one method and selling to one client for many many years and now is basically  
**[0:36:45-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:45):**  not only promoting to change the method but many times if they want to get an extra price  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:52):**  a better price they have to change to a new client and that always entails a risk.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:36:57):**  And farmers in general are very conservative and they say if this has been working for  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:03):**  20 years and I've been selling it and I've been receiving the money like why would I  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:08):**  take the risk to do it even if they are paying me 20% more some people think that the risk  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:14):**  is too high but now after a couple of years that it's been shown that yeah the system  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:21):**  works the method works you can go see the farm and you can talk with the farmer he sold  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:25):**  it and he received the money not just for one year but already for three years in a  
**[0:37:30-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:30):**  row that slowly creates trust but indeed you can gain a client or gain a member and it  
**[0:37:39-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:39):**  takes years and that is very difficult to get new people involved but it's very very  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:46):**  easy to lose them if you make mistakes.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:49):**  Yeah undoubtedly and then totally understandably as well I mean it is such a risky industry  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:37:55):**  to be in these days and actually kind of always has been because you're really at the mercy  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:00):**  of what commodity prices are like what the weather is going to do and so many other things  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:05):**  that are sort of out of your control that adding any extra risk to that is very understandable  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:10):**  that they'd be hesitant if not you know pushing back completely to do it but I think it's  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:15):**  remarkable and it says a lot about the understanding of the people around there that they have  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:21):**  taken these risks up to this point and fortunately those earlier adopters that you've mentioned  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:27):**  were able to do this and now we're at the point where there are very clear demonstrations  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:31):**  and basically techniques and recipes for them to follow to transition in a much more secure  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:38):**  way and I think that's you know absolutely essential not just here in Spain but around  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:42):**  the world to turn this into a movement rather than just you know a small collection of experimental  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:48):**  farms trying to do something different.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:51):**  Yeah indeed and it's in a sector that is especially conservative but it makes total sense because  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:38:59):**  it's not just that if a farmer makes a mistake that loses his job it's not just his job but  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:06):**  it's also his house all his wealth his lifestyle his family so everything is on the line.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:12):**  Yeah yeah well so we've actually mentioned a lot of different things here from the water  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:18):**  harvesting techniques of putting in contour swales building ponds and all of these other  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:23):**  things and this costs a lot of money how have you been finding that I mean obviously with  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:29):**  the the help of international organizations you've been able to put in some of these sort  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:33):**  of as a trial with their financial support and with expertise coming from a lot of different  
**[0:39:38-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:38):**  sources but for the farmers who are implementing this is it a an issue of just figuring out  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:45):**  a way to fund it themselves is it something that they can get bank loans for or are there  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:50):**  other ways to assist these kind of structural changes in the land that pay off hugely down  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:39:56):**  the line but can definitely be difficult to get the funding for in the beginning.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:02):**  Yeah so indeed it is for example quite difficult to get loans for non-productive investments  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:08):**  let's say non-productive in an economic way if they're not going to give you a yield like  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:13):**  the ponds or like the swales or something that is not so clear that it's going to increase  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:19):**  your productivity in the short term so loans are difficult for those parts but we've been  
**[0:40:26-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:26):**  receiving some donations from indeed international entities that mainly private ones to make  
**[0:40:37-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:37):**  these first examples of swales of ponds hedges and borders and things like that and that  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:45):**  Al Delal has been able to give some of these incentives and some of these subsidies to  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:51):**  some farmers to set up a few of those examples a bit in a faster way so people other farmers  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:40:57):**  could go and visit them and have them a bit spread out throughout the territory and but  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:04):**  the money is very limited so even though like many more people would like to do a lot of  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:10):**  those things also with those donations now there's not enough left at the beginning there  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:16):**  was a very small organization with a few people but now that is growing there's more people  
**[0:41:22-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:22):**  than donations available for all of them to do those things but also you see how the commitment  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:31):**  increases and how more farmers do it just with with like paying it all themselves and  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:38):**  all with their own money especially the ones that are selling at a premium price that's  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:43):**  one of the conditions that you have to invest back and that doesn't mean that the first  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:47):**  year you have to do all the ponds and swales compose the ground cover and aromatics that  
**[0:41:52-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:41:52):**  you need and hedges and borders but you you have to start and year by year you have to  
**[0:42:00-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:00):**  do implement more and more of those things and some are more committed or want to do  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:09):**  it the action season faster and others is slower but thanks to that you do see how there  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:15):**  are now yeah that's almost 100 kilometers of swales hundreds of ponds like thousands  
**[0:42:20-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:20):**  of hectares that are applying compost thousands of hectares that are now with the in sheep  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:29):**  and grazing with in between the trees that before it was not happening of ground cover  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:35):**  and yeah you see how more and more farms are increasing their diversification of crops  
**[0:42:41-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:41):**  and yeah I think it's a slow but a steady process yeah undoubtedly and actually you  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:47):**  reminded me there another thing that I had forgotten to ask when you mentioned it about  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:50):**  the compost compost can be difficult to come by in a lot of places are there resources  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:42:56):**  where you are where you can where you can purchase it where there are producers and  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:01):**  truck it into place or are there large scale compost making methods that people have adopted  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:08):**  all the way up to producing with machinery yeah you see a bit of everything so more most  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:14):**  of the small farmers they are buying the compost either from other farmers that are making  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:20):**  it themselves or from a few like companies that are making it in a large scale there  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:27):**  are many also different recipes and ways to do it and with different resources you see  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:33):**  the most common one is from sheep manure and it's mixed with the straw and then the shell  
**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:40):**  of the rice and different other microorganisms and stuff that's the one we do for example  
**[0:43:47-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:47):**  in our farm is mainly with sheep and horse manure that we have in the farm with the straw  
**[0:43:54-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:43:54):**  and we add some microorganisms from the forest that we multiply we add a bit of sugar and  
**[0:44:01-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:01):**  we add some ashes from from all the stoves that we use during the winter in the in the  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:09):**  farm and then with a machine that we have we turn it around in our case because it's  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:15):**  a big farm it's it's worth it for us to make it ourselves and there are some other farms  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:20):**  that do it as well but in general people buy it yeah yeah well it's fantastic that it's  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:26):**  available i've been to so many other places where you couldn't buy it even if you wanted  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:30):**  to it's just it's hard to come by and it is true that it is getting less available it's  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:35):**  getting because more and more people see the how good it is and then the price is increasing  
**[0:44:42-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:42):**  and the amount is limited so you do see that yeah people would like to apply a lot more  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:49):**  than what they're able to find well hopefully that'll create a market for other producers  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:44:55):**  to come in or you know if they're able to charge higher prices for a good finished compost  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:01):**  product that perhaps the farmers themselves will be able to invest in machinery to be  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:06):**  able to produce larger amounts and and realize that you know they'll be compensated for it  
**[0:45:11-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:11):**  yeah indeed i've heard lately of some people considering getting sheep just for the manure  
**[0:45:17-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:17):**  and just for making comfortable so that's wild that's fantastic that those types of  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:23):**  products are beginning to be valued the way they should but it's crazy to think that that  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:28):**  might be the primary product when you're actually getting animals so look um i i would be amazed  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:34):**  if i did not focus on the incredible amount of community work that abuela does as well  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:40):**  i know we've talked a lot about you know the focus on the land and the farming aspect and  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:44):**  the economy but tell me a little bit about the projects in the community that are happening  
**[0:45:50-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:50):**  and how it's helping to solve one of the biggest issues of your area which is the issue of  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:45:56):**  rural depopulation which frankly is a big problem all around spain and in many parts  
**[0:46:01-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:01):**  of the world yeah um well i think we're trying to find that i think every everything we do  
**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:10):**  is kind of fighting that either in an active or in a passive way by making farms more diverse  
**[0:46:17-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:17):**  needing more more work and more hands you're trying to yeah creating jobs and making them  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:26):**  more profitable so people can reinvest in this money in yeah in in making more things  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:32):**  in the farms that that can allow people to stay and not to have to go to the cps to find  
**[0:46:38-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:38):**  a job but also there are projects going on like one is with aromatics that is uh in a  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:47):**  combination like it's for educational purposes uh and it's in a combination with an association  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:53):**  of handicapped people that they are the ones that maintain the the garden of aromatics  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:46:58):**  and are also developed in the business case to sell those essential oils and those finished  
**[0:47:03-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:03):**  products to the market that that helps at the same time finance this association and  
**[0:47:10-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:10):**  that was done like in a collaboration between alvela and other international foundations  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:17):**  that help finance that project that you have uh well the ecosystem restoration camp for  
**[0:47:22-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:22):**  example is is a clear example of how to also connect the local people and the local community  
**[0:47:31-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:31):**  with the international world and how uh young people from uh yeah many parts of the world  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:38):**  come to practice ecosystem restoration to help doing reforestation and that has been  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:44):**  interesting of seeing the reaction of many local people like but why do these people  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:48):**  come here like of all places like what does this place have i know and they start thinking  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:53):**  like if people from outside are valuing and saying how how beautiful it is and what potential  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:47:59):**  it has uh also many people here start valuing it themselves as well so sometimes they have  
**[0:48:05-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:48:05):**  to come from outside to you know to value what you have um yeah and i'm just having  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:48:15):**  that movement of people uh well creates more movement of people you know so more people  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:48:21):**  coming that means more uh the local shop that for example was going to close decided to  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:48:28):**  stay open a bit more because now there are more people buying uh things from it and the  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:48:34):**  bar also said well now they're in the place next to next to my my farm but you see it  
**[0:48:40-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:48:40):**  in other places that yeah there's it's getting more active with farms having yeah getting  
**[0:48:48-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:48:48):**  more busy and creating more jobs i can put an example in in my case in our farm when  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:48:56):**  i went to live there it was empty then it was one person and then four years ago we  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:02):**  were three people and now well now because of the virus everything is a bit more slow  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:09):**  but we are 10 people living there sometimes we are more than 20 when some more students  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:15):**  come by or some volunteers to help doing reforestations we can be up to 30 people also working full  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:22):**  time with the machinery and with the tractors and maintaining the crops before it was one  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:26):**  person now there's five full-time people and i think it's increasing and i think it's it's  
**[0:49:32-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:32):**  just an example of what's happening in other farms as well i think this is one of my favorite  
**[0:49:37-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:37):**  examples to point to that where when you start to invest in life it expands sort of exponentially  
**[0:49:45-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:45):**  or syntropically like you said bringing more people creating more work certainly the amount  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:52):**  of the products that are available to support the economy to support the community all of  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:49:57):**  this comes out of investing in the building blocks and the health of life in your area  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:50:03):**  and i think it's absolutely incredible what this organization is doing i'm so excited  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:50:08):**  to be more increasingly involved with it and you know participating through the ecosystem  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alfonzo-chico-de-guzman/#t=0:50:14):**  restoration campsite before we go though alfonso could you tell our listeners how they can

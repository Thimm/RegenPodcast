**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:05:53):**  Yep.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:05:54):**  Especially along the Mediterranean coast is the most at risk area.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:05:56):**  Yep.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:05:57):**  It's really bad.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:05:59):**  We visited- so I went to the Trebujena National Park, which is a marsh.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:07):**  It might be the biggest protected marsh in Europe.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:11):**  And just north of that, there's this massive rice growing region.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:17):**  Right?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:19):**  I mean, they grow more rice in that region of Spain than any other part of Spain.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:25):**  I mean, there's a lot of smaller small ones like up around here.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:27):**  But yeah, you don't get a lot of wetlands along the coast anymore, certainly.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:34):**  Their production has fallen by 50%.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:37):**  I mean, because they're out of fresh water.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:42):**  I drove by hundreds of fallow fields.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:46):**  They're just dirt.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:48):**  Like, there's no photosynthesis.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:50):**  There's nothing.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:52):**  It's just exposed baking dirt that used to be rice fields.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:06:57):**  And they only have enough water to irrigate half of their fields.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:03):**  And they're right next to the Guadalquivir River.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:07):**  But that river is very salty.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:11):**  So they can't irrigate with it.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:15):**  And so we- I mean, there's so much- they built dikes along the river.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:19):**  So a lot of the marsh has dried up.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:21):**  There's nothing- it's, again, bare dirt that nobody can do anything with because they don't  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:26):**  have the water for it.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:27):**  And the river is salty.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:30):**  So there- I mean, for us, there's so much opportunity there along those degraded marshlands  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:37):**  and along that river.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:41):**  And so I think, you know, the scale of opportunity there, the fact that it gets us entry into  
**[0:07:48-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:48):**  EU markets, the nascent regeneration movement that you're much more connected with than  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:07:58):**  I am, but that I'm excited about, I just think- I think Spain is going to be a great place  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:05):**  to be.

**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:07):**  Definitely from what I've been seeing, it's starting to pick up steam.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:10):**  There has been a lot of interest even up to government levels.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:14):**  I can't speak for all the rest of the country.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:16):**  Obviously, I'm a little more connected to what's going on in Catalunya, but we do have  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:19):**  contacts with farmers in our network along that area and of course in Portugal as well.

**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:31):**  that's showing a lot of promise.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:32):**  And, you know, those areas where you kind of have to kickstart photosynthetic processes  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:36):**  again often is best done with animal impact, even if it means bale grazing up until you

**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:47):**  And so, okay, let's start to fill in the gap between when we did our last interview because  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:51):**  we just made a huge jump right there.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:53):**  And last time that we spoke, you were giving kind of an overview of how you were starting  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:08:58):**  regenerative resources after transitioning away from the Albedo project.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:04):**  And let's talk about what has happened since that time.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:10):**  Been what, 18 months maybe a year?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:12):**  Something like that.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:13):**  A little over a year, I think.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:15):**  You've been traveling like crazy, which not many people have been doing this last year.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:19):**  I have.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:20):**  I have traveled a lot during COVID and my wife's quite sick of it.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:28):**  But I think thankfully things are starting to resolve.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:35):**  So we have been living off of an angel investment and getting projects ready and at the same  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:46):**  time figuring out all sorts of different processes and internal to us.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:53):**  There have been lots of small pivots on business model and product streams and all sorts of  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:09:58):**  things.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:00):**  But we have publicly launched four projects that we are now financing.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:08):**  And we've launched them because now we're confident we'll be able to get them done because  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:13):**  we have access to the land.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:17):**  We have permits.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:20):**  We have political capital.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:22):**  We have social capital with communities that we're partnering with.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:28):**  And so now it's time to fund these projects and lay the stage for expansion into new regions.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:36):**  So Mexico is probably our densest area right now.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:43):**  And that's on the Baja?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:46):**  Yeah, we're primarily in Baja.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:50):**  But two and a half years ago when we started out in Mexico, the environmental ministries  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:10:57):**  didn't even want to meet with us.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:00):**  They didn't even want to have a conversation because we are working with mangroves.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:06):**  And mangroves are a protected species, rightfully so, because 30% of the world's mangroves globally  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:13):**  have been destroyed in the last 50 years.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:18):**  And so when we go to an environmental ministry and say, hey, we have this mangrove farming  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:22):**  system, we want authority to collect, propagate, harvest, and process mangrove products.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:29):**  It's like, no way.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:32):**  Why would they even want to talk to us?  
**[0:11:35-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:35):**  And so we have been in this long journey of developing relationships, finding allies,  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:49):**  getting into meetings with people who hold purse strings or hold authorization or signing  
**[0:11:54-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:11:54):**  power so that they know enough about what we want to do that they will authorize it.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:12:03):**  And thankfully, we got our first set of permits for Mexico in December.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:12:10):**  So we started in Mexico December of 18.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:12:14):**  And I wasn't even on the team yet.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:12:16):**  So they started before I was even on the team in December of 18.

**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:13:57):**  RSA is still our primary product, let's say.

**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:14:17):**  where we have developed partnerships and relationships.

**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:14:36):**  project together.

**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:14:44):**  It was not a key part of our business model.

**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:14:51):**  Their catch has dropped 90% in the last decade.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:14:56):**  They're used to catching 10 fish.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:14:57):**  They're catching one.

**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:15:07):**  And in our conversations with them, one of the things that they brought up was we know  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:15:14):**  that we will have a healthier fishery if we bring our mangroves back.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:15:19):**  So can we do a mangrove restoration project and will you, regenerative resources, support  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:15:26):**  that project?

**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:15:36):**  We just hadn't considered it.

**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:15:44):**  Can we do a restoration project together?

**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:16:04):**  And we just got phase one permitted on the first 3,300 hectares.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:16:10):**  And we have our project manager down there as a local oyster farmer.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:16:15):**  He's actually posting stuff on LinkedIn.

**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:42:09):**  It's not specific to us.

**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:42:28):**  financial world who are like, we can't find projects to fund.

**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:42:37):**  And so I put it together.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:42:39):**  I was like, this is why we can't find projects to fund and why projects can't find finance  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:42:46):**  is because there is this key stage in the beginning where no one's willing to put money  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:42:53):**  in but every project needs to get going.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:42:58):**  So is there an opportunity there?  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:00):**  Probably.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:01):**  But I am not a finance guru.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:04):**  And I don't know enough about that world to be like, here's the innovation and the opportunity.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:09):**  That we need that solves this problem.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:11):**  It's a huge problem.

**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:24):**  Can you break down this Valley of Death concept?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:27):**  Maybe summarize a little bit from the article so that people can catch up with us.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:31):**  So all those things that I just told you about that we do before we can talk to an investor  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:39):**  and the reason you can't talk to an investor is because if you don't have access to the  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:44):**  land, permits, a business model, a financial plan, and a team that can execute, no investor  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:51):**  will look at you and say, yeah, this is an investable project.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:55):**  They'll say it's too risky.  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:57):**  It's not proven yet.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:43:59):**  So no, we're not willing to put our money in because we think there's a high chance  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:44:04):**  that we're just going to lose our money.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:44:07):**  So you have to get a project to the point that it is de-risked enough for an investor  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:44:13):**  to buy it.

**[0:45:12-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:45:12):**  of hard work with a professional team, with a hundred different ways that all sorts of

**[0:49:53-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:49:53):**  I don't know if you're familiar with that one.

**[0:50:08-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:50:08):**  And it's phenomenal what they did.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:50:11):**  That was the first commercial iteration of the seawater system we are deploying now.

**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:50:39):**  And I think that's why we were able to get in.

**[0:58:57-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:58:57):**  Yeah, it will mean millions of hectares of land will have gone through this process so  
**[0:59:03-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:03):**  much that it's just a recognized standard thing.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:07):**  Right.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:08):**  So I see there's a real positive if that happens.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:16):**  And there's, there's a downside to it as well.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:19):**  Yeah.

**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:26):**  Find the degraded land that no one else sees value in, build a regenerative system that's

**[0:59:43-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:43):**  case because you're talking about real assets.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:48):**  So there's, and then there's, so that's a category.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:52):**  I would call that the, was that the third category of regenerative business?  
**[0:59:57-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=0:59:57):**  The first was the novelty product that anchors a regenerative system.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:01):**  The second was working with farmers, all propagate ventures to transform existing farms into

**[1:00:11-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:11):**  Then there's ours, which is the asset based.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:14):**  And then the fourth, I would say is enabling tech, right?  
**[1:00:19-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:19):**  Tech that somehow enables, uh, the transformation or the verification or the marketing or the  
**[1:00:28-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:28):**  commercialization of these systems that are being put into place.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:32):**  Um, like I haven't heard it broken down in those four categories before, and it just  
**[1:00:38-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:38):**  makes me think of, you know, my work with climate farmers now.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:41):**  So we are in both two and four by your categorization.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:44):**  So the tech side is creating the algorithms and the verification process to use satellite  
**[1:00:51-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:00:51):**  imagery in order to verify carbon captured and also our whole range of other ecosystem

**[1:01:01-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:01):**  has to include like real regeneration aspects.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:05):**  And then I'm more closely working with the community and the academy side where we're  
**[1:01:11-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:11):**  facilitating the transition of conventional agronomy or agriculturalist to regenerative

**[1:01:23-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:23):**  here in helping large agro food businesses like a Denone or Nestle or whoever, you know,  
**[1:01:30-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:30):**  may come to us and do it on a contract basis to help them move their whole suite of land  
**[1:01:37-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:37):**  assets and farmers within that on mass and be able to scale it up.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:42):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:43):**  And that would actually be my fifth category is the revamping supply chains, right?  
**[1:01:52-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:01:52):**  The Denone, the Unilevers, the Nestle, the, I don't know, all of them, ostensibly, a lot

**[1:02:03-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:02:03):**  Right, right, right.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:02:04):**  I mean, that's like 80% of the entire world's agribusiness, right?  
**[1:02:10-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:02:10):**  But ostensibly there's need for them to source regeneratively grown ingredients.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:02:17):**  And there is a whole like, and then so what would you say?

**[1:04:59-1:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:04:59):**  Yeah.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:05:00):**  And so it's, I have a love hate relationship with the climate tech world.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:05:10):**  And some people look at us and say, oh, regenerative resources is climate tech.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:05:16):**  And sometimes I'm like tempted to market ourselves that way.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:05:21):**  Like to say, like to say, yes, we, there's no question.

**[1:05:38-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:05:38):**  yeah out of necessity.

**[1:06:57-1:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:06:57):**  necessary to, to inspire confidence in the investors, you know, to have a bit of a resume

**[1:07:18-1:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:07:18):**  in this process and others that either you have or you wish you had that might make this  
**[1:07:25-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:07:25):**  easier or grease the wheels?

**[1:07:38-1:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:07:38):**  process of doing a project, whether it's construction or infrastructure or forestry or a new marketing

**[1:08:18-1:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:08:18):**  Farmers have some of the hardest jobs on the planet because they have to be a businessman.

**[1:08:37-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:08:37):**  to be successful when they go direct to consumer, that's marketing and building a community

**[1:08:49-1:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:08:49):**  And fundamentally what that comes down to is managing people, right?  
**[1:08:55-1:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:08:55):**  And understanding them, especially in the marketing side.

**[1:09:04-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:04):**  Very much so.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:05):**  Financial management.

**[1:09:09-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:09):**  So in our RSA system, and I'll talk about Mexico.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:15):**  They they're all variations on a theme in the places where we're going right now, but  
**[1:09:20-1:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:20):**  in Mexico, we're going to have at least six major production systems that are choreographed  
**[1:09:33-1:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:33):**  to form a cohesive whole, right?

**[1:09:42-1:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:42):**  And we might do some fin fish as well.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:45):**  And I'm not an aquaculture list, right?  
**[1:09:47-1:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:47):**  I've never run a shrimp farm in my life.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:50):**  And then there is the mangrove coppice system, the halophytic alley cropping system.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:09:59):**  And then there's the constructed wetland and production within that.  
**[1:10:03-1:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:10:03):**  And in the wetland, we can do sea cucumbers, crab, lobster, microalgae, bivalves.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:10:12):**  And all of them, except for the aquacultures, are sequestering carbon and providing ecological  
**[1:10:19-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:10:19):**  services.

**[1:10:30-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:10:30):**  services.

**[1:10:40-1:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:10:40):**  And I could be considered an expert on probably the alley cropping, right?  
**[1:10:50-1:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:10:50):**  Because I've set up alley cropping systems before.  
**[1:10:53-1:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:10:53):**  Nobody's an expert on the coppice.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:10:56):**  I have looked for years now for indigenous mangrove coppice systems.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:11:03):**  And I don't think it exists.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:11:07):**  I think we're creating it.

**[1:11:12-1:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:11:12):**  Is that the idea?

**[1:11:18-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/neal-spackman-on-the-planning-and-considerations-behind-the-regeneration-of-large-landscapes/#t=1:11:18):**  They haven't been.

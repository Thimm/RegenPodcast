### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:40):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:19):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:20):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:24):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:41):**  Alright everybody, welcome back.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:43):**  Now continuing today with this ongoing series on waterway regeneration and a deep dive into  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:48):**  marine ecosystems, I had the pleasure of speaking with Brian Von Herten.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:53):**  Now Brian is an ocean scientist, engineer, and entrepreneur, and though much of his career  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:58):**  has been in Silicon Valley where he developed innovative technical solutions for companies  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:02):**  like Pixar, Dolby, and Microsoft, Brian is also the founder and executive director of  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:08):**  the nonprofit The Climate Foundation, which is an institute working to regenerate life  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:12):**  in the world's oceans and reverse global warming within our lifetimes.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:17):**  Through Brian's work with The Climate Foundation, he's been promoting the concept of marine  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:21):**  permaculture through ocean, seaweed, and kelp farming in a way that could potentially revitalize  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:26):**  areas of degraded coastline as well as spark a whole new economy around marine ecosystem  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:32):**  stewardship.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:33):**  In this interview, Brian starts by explaining just how immense and important the kelp forests  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:38):**  of the world are by describing the impact that they've had on the ecology of the west  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:42):**  coast of the United States.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:45):**  I think it's so important to regain reference to what our healthy and intact biosphere used  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:50):**  to be because all of us alive today have almost no reference to what our natural world even  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:55):**  looked like before humans started to alter and degrade it so severely.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:00):**  Brian also breaks down what it could mean for the economy and health of the west if  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:04):**  these underwater forests could be regenerated and cared for.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:08):**  We also explore some of the challenges in getting sea farming and ocean permaculture  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:11):**  projects started and especially funded, since the initial costs are often much higher than  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:16):**  land-based initiatives.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:19):**  We cover a lot of ground in this talk and even touch on topics like how marine farming  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:23):**  fits into a regenerative economy and what those of you listening can do to support and  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:27):**  even start your own marine permaculture projects.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:30):**  So be sure to stick around for some great action steps by the end.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:34):**  Now with all of that said, I'll turn things over now to Brian.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:37):**  Hey Brian, I'm really excited to be talking to you today.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:40):**  Thanks so much for making time to be on the podcast.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:42):**  Hi Oliver, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:44):**  Thank you.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:45):**  So look, as much as I would love to go directly into your personal background and how you  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:49):**  started working in marine permaculture and ecosystem restoration, why don't we start  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:56):**  even before that and go into the natural history of some of the ecosystems, especially on the  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:03):**  ocean side, that give you reference as to what optimal health in a pre-industrial ecology  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:10):**  at its full potential can look like so that we can orient ourselves towards something  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:16):**  that is really worth regenerating.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:18):**  Yes, I'm happy to do that Oliver.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:21):**  You're reminding me back in high school I did a paper on the geology that affected the  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:32):**  spit of land that I was living on.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:34):**  Cape Cod is a geologic feature formed by the ice ages.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:39):**  And these ice sheets that came down from northern Canada deposited the sand that formed Cape  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:44):**  Cod.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:45):**  And my natural curiosity was understanding the geologic history of Cape Cod.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:50):**  And so I started, I remember in high school writing this paper on what created Cape Cod,  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:55):**  the ice ages that created Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket Islands in a series of  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:01):**  stages over the past tens and hundreds of thousands of years.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:05):**  And so it was through that understanding of the ice ages and the transformed climate of  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:12):**  the earth, I was able to get an understanding for the land I was living on, get an understanding  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:18):**  for what was happening and what the changes were.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:23):**  And I read with interest that we were scheduled to enter the next ice age, like we were in  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:30):**  a cooling trend and that by default the earth was going to go into another ice age.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:36):**  Little did I know that with our greenhouse gas emissions, we canceled the next ice age  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:42):**  and recreated the next global warming spike of unprecedented proportions in the last tens  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:49):**  of millions of years.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:50):**  Yeah, that throws things out of whack quite a bit.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:53):**  So it sounds like your interest in this really started from an earlier schooling level.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:58):**  And since then, using the references of those other ecosystems of pre-industrial times,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:03):**  like the kelp forests of the Western coast, can you tell me a little bit more about what  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:07):**  these marine ecosystems looked like before we started to meddle with them so much?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:13):**  Yes, I went back and I studied the old US geodetic survey maps, the oldest one of which  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:19):**  was around 1853.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:22):**  And these maps actually portrayed the kelp forest off of California.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:27):**  And what I was amazed at was on this map that I looked at from 1853, it showed a river of  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:34):**  kelp a kilometer wide, stretching from Pointe Concepción in central California all the  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:40):**  way to the Mexican border.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:42):**  And I was like, what is that?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:44):**  I mean, I've never even seen that.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:46):**  In fact, no one has a living memory today of the kelp forest that once were back in  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:52):**  the 1800s.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:53):**  And it wasn't just one map.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:54):**  There was a map from 1868, there was a map from 1888, and each one of them showed a continuous  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:02):**  river of kelp a kilometer wide going from Pointe Concepción to the Mexican border.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:09):**  I was just amazing.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:10):**  And it wasn't until the 1930s where there was another US geodetic survey map that showed  
**[0:07:19-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:19):**  that farming had come into the area and that the siltation, the soil, the runoff, and the  
**[0:07:27-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:27):**  nutrients had gotten into the coastal waters and had effectively silted up the nearshore  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:36):**  waters enough that the juvenile baby kelps, 25 meters beneath the surface, didn't have  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:43):**  enough light anymore to grow.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:46):**  And they died.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:47):**  And that river of kelp diminished and disappeared and became discontinuous.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:51):**  And by the early 2000s, there was hardly any river left.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:56):**  There was no river left.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:57):**  It was just a spot or two of kelp here and there, more than 90% depleted.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:01):**  And that to me was just shocking that no one alive today had a living memory of the kelp  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:07):**  forest that once were.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:09):**  And that's such a loss in our collective consciousness as well, because without that as reference,  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:14):**  how do we know what we're trying to get back to?  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:17):**  That is a good point.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:18):**  You know, there's this principle called shifting baselines, and it applies to salmon fisheries  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:23):**  up around the Pacific Northwest or my own hometown, Cape Cod itself.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:27):**  Do you know why they named it?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:29):**  Because a majority of the able-bodied men on Cape Cod 200 years ago were fishing cod.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:37):**  And I'm a snorkeler.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:39):**  I go swimming all the time.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:40):**  I'd never seen a codfish.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:43):**  I spent years and years learning how to swim and snorkeling and whatnot around Cape Cod,  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:49):**  but I've never seen a codfish because the cod had gone commercially extinct on Cape  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:56):**  Cod.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:57):**  So there's a shifting baseline.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:02):**  People talk about walking on the backs of the salmon across a river because there were  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:07):**  so many salmon.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:09):**  It's like just a river choke full of salmon.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:12):**  And those are some of the unprecedented events that we have a hard time getting back to.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:18):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:20):**  So with that said, how could we start to move towards that kind of abundance again?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:25):**  And what impacts would it have on the communities and the inhabitants of those areas if we managed  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:30):**  to do so?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:32):**  Well, I think this is primarily about understanding the trim tabs, if you will.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:40):**  One of my favorite systems thinkers, Buckminster Fuller, talks about the trim tab on a ship  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:47):**  or an airplane.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:49):**  And the trim tab shifts the rudder, and the rudder shifts the tail of the airplane, and  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:54):**  the tail of the airplane shifts the entire airplane, even if it's an Airbus 380 or a  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:59):**  Boeing 747.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:01):**  So can we be the trim tabs on our civilization?  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:05):**  Can we be the trim tabs on our ecosystem and get us back to regeneration?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:12):**  Regeneration of the ecosystem services that end up creating enough food for people, enough  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:19):**  food for nature, and ultimately a carbon balance that gets restored in the oceans and in the  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:25):**  soils and balances our carbon budget in the atmosphere.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:30):**  And along those lines, can you give us an overview now of the work that you're doing  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:34):**  and some of the projects that are helping you to become one of the trim tabs to guide  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:39):**  towards regeneration?  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:40):**  Certainly.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:41):**  I think one example is understanding the role that kelp forests play on the coastal ecosystems  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:49):**  and that seaweed forests and seaweed farms play in the tropics.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:54):**  I was really surprised to learn that the tropical rainforest can fix up to 2,200 grams of carbon  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:02):**  per square meter per year, just one way of measuring productivity, if you will, the primary  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:08):**  fixation of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and the creation of ecosystem life, the creation  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:14):**  of biomass.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:15):**  What surprised me was that the kelp forest could do 15% more carbon than the tropical  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:21):**  rainforests of Brazil.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:22):**  I mean, who would have thought that the kelp forest sitting offshore California fixed 15%  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:28):**  more carbon each year than the tropical rainforest and that in many senses, the tropical rainforests  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:34):**  of the West Coast could be considered to be the kelp forest that's offshore.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:40):**  And what I learned of the enormous carbon fixing potential of kelp forests as just the  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:46):**  beginning of what I would call a trophic cascade of ecosystem services, not only are we growing  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:52):**  lots and lots of kelp, but we're creating fish habitat.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:56):**  And that fish habitat is a place for all the sardines to hang out.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:01):**  And some people say, oh, sardines school offshore.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:03):**  But when they don't have a school, the sardines hang out in the kelp.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:06):**  And if you want to make another school of sardines, you start out with a big kelp forest  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:10):**  and you let the sardines multiply inside the kelp forest.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:13):**  And some of them spill out and those will form a bigger school or they'll get harvested  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:18):**  by game fish or even apex predators.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:21):**  But that's an example of a trim tab and that is making sure that kelp forests can thrive  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:27):**  to enable the fish habitat to occur.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:29):**  And if you build the fish habitat, they will come.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:33):**  There's this inevitable relationship that, you know, habitat is more important than food  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:38):**  for forage fish because if they don't have habitat, they're going to get eaten that night.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:43):**  And so they need to have habitat.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:45):**  And when you build that habitat, you get the forage fish and then you get the game fish  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:50):**  and then you get the apex predators.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:52):**  And that creates a rich, diverse ecosystem that is balanced.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:58):**  And you know, one of my advisors back at Caltech, Dick Fineman, like to say, you don't understand  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:03):**  a system until you've built it.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:06):**  And I would add to that, we don't understand an ecosystem until we've rebuilt it and recapitulated  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:13):**  the trophic cascades and the healthy, vibrant biodiversity that we see on the kelp forest  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:19):**  today.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:20):**  That's fantastic because it really seems to be addressing the root cause there and the  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:25):**  aspect of the ecosystem that is key for all of those other functions to flourish, which  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:30):**  is starting with the plant life.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:32):**  And I know that there are a lot of programs these days to reintroduce different members  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:37):**  of different hierarchies in the food web in order to sort of kickstart the regeneration  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:42):**  of an entire ecosystem.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:43):**  And you're starting there with the kelp forest.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:46):**  And in reestablishing these, let's say, baseline aspects of the food web, it fits in with a  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:55):**  larger business model as well, because you're not just dependent on donations and a nonprofit  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:00):**  model to do this.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:02):**  There's actually the potential to create a lot of products that are useful for plenty  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:07):**  of different industries.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:08):**  Do you want to speak on the business model for a minute?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:12):**  Definitely.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:13):**  The whole objective is to build a self-sustaining marine permaculture industry that can harvest  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:19):**  sustainably, millions of dollars in seaweed.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:23):**  It's kind of like mowing the lawn.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:25):**  And millions of dollars in fish per square kilometer per year.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:28):**  And those fish spill out of the forest around the sides.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:32):**  And those fish that spill out on the sides can be harvested while leaving intact the  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:36):**  incubator, which is the forest itself.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:40):**  And that sustainable harvesting, mowing the lawn, if you will, of the top meter of seaweed  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:46):**  and the fish around the edge of the system, that we view as a very sustainable model that  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:51):**  can enable big ocean nations to thrive around the world and even offshore.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:57):**  Even landlocked states can do offshore systems like this.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:01):**  And up until now, we've mostly talked about kelp when we're talking about seaweed.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:05):**  But seaweed isn't just one thing.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:08):**  Can you tell me about some of the different varieties and the different conditions that  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:13):**  they need to grow and thrive?  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:14):**  Yes.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:15):**  There are over 14,000 species of seaweed.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:18):**  And we've probably figured out how to commercially utilize one or two dozen.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:22):**  So isn't that amazing?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:25):**  So there are red seaweeds, there are brown seaweeds, and there are green seaweeds.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:29):**  The kelps fall under a subset of the brown seaweeds.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:33):**  And each of them has special properties and characteristics.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:36):**  But there are thousands of reds and thousands of browns and thousands of greens.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:41):**  And so it's like we're at the tip of the iceberg as far as species diversity and uses.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:46):**  There's so many things to do with so many of the seaweeds and they have special properties.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:50):**  In fact, I keep being astounded at the superfood nature of seaweeds for human health, for animal  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:58):**  and livestock health, and for the health of the ecosystem.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:02):**  I'm just astounded at the multiple benefits that we've been able to identify for sea plants  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:08):**  in general.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:09):**  Well, let's dive into that a little bit more.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:11):**  Tell me about some of the products that can be made from seaweed and especially some of  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:16):**  the ones that you're most excited about because I know there's a lot of them.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:19):**  Yes.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:20):**  Well, the list goes on and on.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:21):**  I start with the seven Fs and that is food, feed, and fertilizer, fish, biofuel, and fiber.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:29):**  And the seventh F is kind of funny, pharmaceuticals.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:32):**  I'm not going to put in that category kind of nutraceuticals.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:37):**  And it's surprising that both the nutraceuticals that we use today and many of the pharmaceuticals  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:44):**  are actually found from marine organisms.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:48):**  They discover them in the marine environment and they figure out how to produce them in  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:53):**  isolation.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:54):**  But it's really nature that's finding half of the pharmaceuticals that we end up using,  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:58):**  which is fascinating to me.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:01):**  But I would go back to Michael Pollan and that is that whole foods are better for us,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:07):**  mostly plants, not too much.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:09):**  And the mostly plants and the whole food aspect is really key because I find that a whole  
**[0:17:15-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:15):**  food seaweed that's relatively unprocessed is better than some refined product from the  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:24):**  seaweed because it has such a complex set of nutrients.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:28):**  And we're finding even that fresh seaweed is even better than dry seaweed.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:32):**  So we're actually thinking, okay, how can we develop some new food products that are  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:36):**  kind of in the fresh category?  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:38):**  Or when I go surfing, I actually go and I eat seaweed in the water when I go surfing  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:43):**  because clean water, you're not going to get fresher seaweed.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:47):**  And I'm always testing out different species.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:51):**  Almost all of the 14,000 species are non-toxic and many of them are really tasty and edible.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:56):**  They tend to have really interesting textures.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:58):**  Many of them don't have such a strong flavor, but it's kind of like pasta.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:02):**  Everybody loves pasta, but is it really the pasta they're loving or is it the sauces they  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:06):**  put on the pasta?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:09):**  Imagine like there's a spaghetti seaweed even.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:11):**  Imagine that you took a spaghetti seaweed and use that as your pasta instead.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:15):**  And now you've got gluten-free, low glycemic index, wonderful whole food that is underneath  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:21):**  your beautiful sauces.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:23):**  It's amazing the potential of how it could be combined and explored in a culinary sense  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:28):**  as well for sure.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:29):**  Oh, it's fascinating.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:30):**  And we've got so many chefs really enthused to incorporate seaweed into everyday products.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:35):**  And as a garnish, as a side dish, it is probably the most healthy thing that you could put  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:39):**  on your plate.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:40):**  It's just amazing.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:41):**  I mean, we're looking at Asia where in Japan and Thailand, they have seven times lower  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:47):**  incidence of breast cancer.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:49):**  You look at cognitive function and cognitive health span, seaweeds are the original source  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:54):**  of EPA and DHA, which is brain food.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:58):**  And then cardiovascular, it's just amazing.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:00):**  When you have a regular dose of seaweed, they've done this with rats and mice, it actually  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:06):**  reverses the metabolic syndrome that leads to obesity.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:10):**  And so literally they would like feed these mice McDonald's diet.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:15):**  And then if they add a little bit of seaweed to their water, they go from obese to not  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:21):**  obese just because they've added the seaweed.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:24):**  So I was just blown away that it could reverse metabolic syndrome.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:28):**  But all of these effects.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:29):**  It's just the real potential there.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:30):**  It is.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:31):**  It's amazing to me.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:32):**  Well, talk to me now about creating an entire ecosystem out of this ocean farming model.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:38):**  I know that we've sort of focused on the cultivation of the seaweed aspect of it, but that's really  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:42):**  sort of just the starter or the environment that allows for so much other life to thrive.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:48):**  What are the different levels of life in the ocean, almost like we would consider them,  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:53):**  let's say in a food forest or an agroforestry system in the seven levels of a forest?  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:57):**  What are the levels in an aquatic system?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:59):**  Are you talking about different trophic levels?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, and the life forms that occupy them.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:06):**  Yes.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:07):**  Well, I think it starts with the autotrophs, right?  
**[0:20:09-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:09):**  And the autotrophs are what are actually making biomass out of mineral sources of nutrients.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:18):**  So we're talking about nitrate, we're talking about phosphate, we're talking about micronutrients.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:22):**  And that is a combination of the macroalgae seaweeds and the microalgae plankton.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:28):**  So the plankton, they fix all these nutrients and carbon dioxide, and they're floating around  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:35):**  and they make carbohydrates.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:38):**  And they float around and they get eaten by mussels and bivalves and invertebrates and  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:42):**  all the filter feeders, as well as some fish.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:45):**  You know, sardines end up eating plankton too.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:48):**  So that's the food for the sardines.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:50):**  Now the habitat for the sardines comes initially from macroalgae.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:55):**  And the macroalgae are the kelp forests, the seaweed forests.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:59):**  And that is again an autotrophic production.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:02):**  Those macroalgae, the kelp, synthesize biomass from the inorganic nutrients, from the nitrate  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:12):**  and the phosphate and the micronutrients.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:14):**  And so they're effectively creating the stuff of life out of inorganic materials.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:19):**  And that's where this whole trophic level begins.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:23):**  So the sardines get their food from the microalgae and their habitat from the macroalgae, and  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:28):**  those become the fin fish, if you will.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:31):**  But before then, I will mention the invertebrates, which are living around the kelp forest and  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:37):**  the seaweed forest.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:38):**  And sometimes they're actually on the sea floor.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:41):**  And other times they're actually, as epiphytes, actually on the kelp itself.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:47):**  And so they live in this ecosystem on the kelp or on the sea floor.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:51):**  And there's enormous habitat, of course.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:53):**  There's a lot of food.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:54):**  Lobsters are known to eat kelp.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:57):**  Abaloneis eat kelp.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:58):**  I mean, so many different invertebrates eat kelp for living.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:04):**  It's the food, the fundamental food of the ecosystem.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:07):**  So that's kind of the second level.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:09):**  The fin fish begin with the sardines and the anchovies, even juvenile salmon.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:13):**  And that's kind of the second trophic level because they're eating microalgae.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:17):**  And then you've got game fish that are eating the forage fish, the vegetarians, so to speak.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:23):**  And then you've got apex predators who are eating the game fish.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:28):**  And so it goes up the trophic level.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:30):**  Now what's significant is this.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:32):**  The DHA and the EPA, which is so neuroprotective, the Harvard Medical School has come out with  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:36):**  reports on this, it's incredibly neuroprotective.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:39):**  And it is created in the algae.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:43):**  And then it is accumulated by the small forage fish.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:47):**  And that's one thing that makes sardines and anchovies and even small salmon very good  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:53):**  to eat, very neuroprotective is that they have accumulated the DHA and the EPA omega-3  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:58):**  fatty acids in their bodies.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:01):**  And that's where it comes from.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:02):**  It doesn't actually come from the fish, it comes from the algae.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:05):**  And that's fine because, but they also are slowly accumulating some of the heavy metals,  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:11):**  some of the mercury that came from fossil fuel burning and things like that.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:16):**  And the gasoline, there was lead put in gasoline and things like that.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:20):**  What happens is at the forage fish level, the neuroprotective effects of the EPA and  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:27):**  the DHA far outweigh any hazards.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:29):**  But as you go up to the game fish and then to the tuna fish, the levels of the heavy  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:37):**  metals increases much more than the EPA and the DHA.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:42):**  So you start running into problems of mercury, which is coming from coal power plants, that's  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:49):**  now distributed throughout the surface oceans in some places more than others.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:54):**  There's a lot of coal burning in China, for example.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:56):**  And so the South China Sea has some 20 times the level of mercury as the rest of the Pacific  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:07):**  Ocean.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:08):**  So ironically, there's also this bioaccumulation so that the sardines have far less mercury  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:15):**  than the game fish, which have left less mercury than the tuna fish.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:20):**  What's amazing is that some tuna fish have 50 times the level of mercury that a sardine  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:24):**  does.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:25):**  So ironically, a tuna fish from the South China Sea might have a thousand times the  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:31):**  level of mercury as a sardine from the Pacific Ocean.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:36):**  And that is a very significant factor.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:38):**  So I'm a fan of small fish.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:40):**  I also eat seaweed.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:42):**  And those are highly neuroprotective.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:43):**  But you have to be careful with the amount of large game fish that you actually eat.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:48):**  And you know, these days, humans have farmed out, no, humans have captured 90% of the big  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:54):**  fish in the ocean.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:55):**  And so the levels are far lower.  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:58):**  And so it's much more impacted.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:59):**  And what we need to do is leave a big fish alone, let them repopulate, and go for the  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:05):**  small forage fish.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:06):**  And with marine permaculture, we're looking forward to growing a trillion more sardines  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:10):**  without nets, without fish feed, and without deep water moorings, and enabling those sardine  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:16):**  fisheries to thrive in a way that they did decades ago.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:20):**  You remember the Monterey sardine cannery, you know, off of Northern California, they  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:25):**  could return to abundance.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:27):**  We've lost some, more than half of our major forage fisheries in the world have been decimated.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:35):**  And I think we've got the opportunity to regenerate those.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:38):**  And we could do those with marine permaculture, one kelp forest at a time.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:41):**  Oh, that's so exciting.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:42):**  And it's very good to hear some hope at the end of that description of just how bad things  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:46):**  have gotten.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:48):**  Now, we've also focused a lot on the marine ecosystems up until now.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:53):**  But we were speaking just before this interview, and you told me that you're doing some more  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:56):**  work in freshwater environments.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:58):**  Do you want to tell me about that now?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:00):**  Yes.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:01):**  So, you know, part of what I was looking at in my geologic history analysis was looking  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:06):**  at the major events of the last hundred million years.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:08):**  And I came across this one 49 million years ago that just was the strangest thing.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:12):**  It was called the Azolla event.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:14):**  That's like, what was that?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:16):**  Because there was this huge carbon drawdown associated with the Azolla event.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:20):**  It's like, what's going on?  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:21):**  Well, it turns out there's this aquatic fern called Azolla.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:25):**  And there's seven species alive today.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:28):**  And you know, back 50 million years ago, there were crocodiles in the Arctic Ocean, and there  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:32):**  were palm trees.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:33):**  And it was really hot up there.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:35):**  It was very warm.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:39):**  And this Azolla existed up there.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:41):**  And every springtime, it would start growing out near the rivers towards the Arctic Ocean.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:48):**  And there was this lens of freshwater on the surface of the Arctic Ocean.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:52):**  And so this freshwater fern that could handle about five parts per thousand salt would start  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:56):**  growing out across the Arctic Ocean and would potentially cover most of the million square  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:01):**  kilometers in one summer.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:03):**  I mean, it takes three days for Azolla to double.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:06):**  And so you run through the math and yeah, 100 days of summer, you're pretty much at  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:10):**  a thousand by a thousand, it's like a million square kilometers of Azolla.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:15):**  And then autumn would come.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:17):**  And in the autumn, the light level would drop, the Azolla would decay and die.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:22):**  And it would sink into the anoxic Arctic Ocean and lay down a layer of oil.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:28):**  And believe it or not, most of the oil we have in the Arctic today came from Azolla.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:35):**  It's just amazing.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:36):**  Like, I couldn't even believe it that one plant could draw down so much carbon and do  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:41):**  it so quickly.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:42):**  I mean, I was just kind of blown away.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:44):**  It's like, wow.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:45):**  I mean, if that works, I mean, it's like, why don't we just like grow some Azolla and  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:50):**  start fixing carbon?  
**[0:27:51-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:51):**  Well, so it turns out Azolla does a great job of doubling every three days, fixing nitrogen.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:00):**  And actually, ironically, it's the only freshwater vegetarian source I'm aware of, of producing  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:05):**  EPA and DHA.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:06):**  Because inside every Azolla plant is this symbiotic cyanobacterium that comes from the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:12):**  ocean, fixes nitrogen, and guess what?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:15):**  It grows EPA and DHA.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:16):**  So like, if you want your EPA and DHA and you want to eat fresh water, if you're a vegan,  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:21):**  or something, Azolla and seaweed is the way to go.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:24):**  And if you're landlocked and fresh water, you want to grow Azolla and eat it because  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:28):**  it's got this incredible neuroprotective brain food.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:32):**  I mean, that's what's going to give you cognitive healthspan.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:35):**  And the literature is already coming out showing that EPA and DHA, these kind of whole foods  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:42):**  that have EPA and DHA, are a key to cognitive healthspan well into your later phases of  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:49):**  life.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:50):**  And that's a great opportunity to really make that happen.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:54):**  So Azolla is amazing.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:55):**  And if you've got a waterway that's got excess nitrate or phosphate, Azolla is just going  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:00):**  to soak it up and it'll take all the excess phosphate in if there's no nitrate left because  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:04):**  it can fix its own nitrogen.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:06):**  So what might be growing in an irrigation ditch or a stream or something like that,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:11):**  or if you have a river that's got too much nutrients in it, you can put Azolla in and  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:17):**  harvest it.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:18):**  It's going to be there every three days or it's going to just take over and then sink  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:20):**  and turn into an anoxic mess.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:23):**  But if you harvest regularly, then it becomes a livestock feed.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:29):**  The fish like it.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:31):**  I've seen chickens fighting over it and we fed it to cows and to horses with good results.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:36):**  And by the way, when you feed it to chickens, you get omega-3 eggs, which is great.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:41):**  Wow.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:43):**  I'd never heard about this before.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:44):**  Is this just so new that it hasn't really made it out into the media yet or is there  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:51):**  something else holding it back?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:52):**  Well, I'd say the future is here today.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:55):**  It's just not broadly distributed yet.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:58):**  But ironically, Azolla grows naturally in Louisiana.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:03):**  Azolla carolina is one of the seven species.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:07):**  If it freezes, it tends to die.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:09):**  So it's really a warm water plant.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:10):**  But every springtime, even in your cold environment, you could grow some Azolla and feed it to  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:15):**  your animals, feed it to your livestock.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:17):**  Just make sure you harvest it every three days so that it, you harvest half of it every  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:22):**  three days to keep up with it.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:24):**  But assuming you do that and it stays nicely oxidative, it can pull all the nutrients out  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:29):**  of that environment and you can clean up your rivers, clean up your ponds, clean up your  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:33):**  waterways and you're going to have very healthy livestock as a result.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:37):**  That's pretty wild.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:38):**  Is it a simple process of just seeding the water?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:40):**  Well, yeah, I mean, it'll double every three days.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:43):**  You got to manage it.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:44):**  It's considered a weed and a pest in a lot of places.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:46):**  But I'll tell you, it's considered a green fertilizer in Vietnam.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:49):**  And when they're growing rice and the rice patties, they put in the Azolla first and  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:53):**  it grows and it fixes nitrogen.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:55):**  And then later the rice grows up and uses that nitrogen to grow better and they have  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:00):**  to reduce.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:01):**  They don't need as much fertilizer on their rice patties because they've got Azolla.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:07):**  That's wild.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:08):**  I don't remember seeing that when I lived in a rice growing community in the Philippines,  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:12):**  but I should have looked into it closer.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:14):**  I was mostly building buildings when I was there.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:17):**  Well, it's broadly distributed and used in Vietnam, but it has yet to really kick in  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:23):**  in India and I'm not sure about Philippines.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:26):**  So I'd look to, I mean, Vietnam is a great example of where it's being used now.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:30):**  Okay.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:31):**  And is there any risk of it becoming an invasive species?  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:36):**  Does it double so fast?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:38):**  Well, it exists naturally in places like Louisiana and Mississippi.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:42):**  So if you're going to have it go back in there, then it's okay.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:46):**  There's seven different species around the world and I'd look for a local species and  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:50):**  try to use that.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:52):**  Decwe go, it grows in just two days, but it doesn't fix nitrogen.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:55):**  So it doesn't have quite the same properties.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:57):**  But we've managed to grow Azolla in various dry locations and I think it's just checking  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:04):**  with your local authorities.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:06):**  Sometimes they call these things weeds, but you know, one person's weed is another person's  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:10):**  bounty.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:11):**  So it's all a matter of finding the right combinations that are going to work well.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:15):**  And I wouldn't be surprised if you can go to your local drainage dish and find some  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:18):**  Azolla and start cultivating it.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:20):**  Yeah, I got to figure out what it looks like.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:22):**  I'm going to do some research after this.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:24):**  Is it something you can buy, sort of like a spawn or a seed that you can then scatter  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:28):**  into a waterway?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:30):**  We have purchased Azolla for internal cultivation in the United States and so that can be done.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:38):**  Generally speaking, it's a warmer climate plant and so it's something that you may need  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:44):**  to cultivate in a colder water region to be able to, because seasonally in the summer  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:50):**  it can do a great job of absorbing nutrients and then each springtime you might need to  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:56):**  reintroduce it.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:57):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:58):**  So we've talked about a number of different ways that this can be turned into a farming  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:01):**  context and even some business models that can be made out of it, but setting up an ocean  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:06):**  farming infrastructure especially is a very expensive endeavor and it requires quite a  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:11):**  bit of engineering.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:13):**  Where have you been finding support and financial backing to sort of launch the prototypes and  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:18):**  the operating models to trial this?  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:22):**  Well there are several foundations who have helped us from the United States and elsewhere.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:28):**  We've gotten support from the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, Schmidt  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:35):**  Futures and some of the US governmental organizations including the US Fish and Wildlife Service  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:41):**  for various facets of marine permaculture.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:47):**  One of the reasons we went to the Philippines early on is that there are a quarter million  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:52):**  subsistence seaweed farmers today in the Philippines who are living on the front lines of climate  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:57):**  disruption.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:58):**  The water is too warm, the nutrient levels are too low and as a result they can grow  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:04):**  seaweed and feed their families five months a year and not 12 months a year.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:08):**  And what we do with marine permaculture is provide deep water irrigation for these fresh  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:14):**  seaweeds that enable them to thrive even during the driest portions of the year.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:20):**  And that's a really key insight is that by bringing irrigation to seaweed farms as well  
**[0:34:27-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:27):**  as to regular terrestrial farms, we can ensure steady production every month of the year.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:35):**  And that means that the subsistence farmers can have a way to feed their families 12 months  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:41):**  a year.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:42):**  And that's essential to sustainable livelihoods and the sustenance of the seaweed farming  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:48):**  communities and really our civilization fundamentally.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:52):**  Yeah, that's very promising and it really brings in the community aspect of a project.  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:58):**  It does.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:59):**  Yeah, so as we're looking at a project here, kind of give me a rundown, perhaps with a  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:03):**  case example of one that you've helped to start.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:06):**  What is the process?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:08):**  Let's say you've gotten the funding from the organizations that you might have mentioned  
**[0:35:11-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:11):**  and what are some of the steps on the ground that are required to get this up and running?  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:19):**  Well, we need a source of seaweeds and in the Philippines there are several red seaweeds  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:24):**  that are commonly used to produce carrageenan for food products today.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:29):**  And that's a great traditional use.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:30):**  But then there's, you know, we're moving towards a biorefinery model and the way the biorefinery  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:35):**  model works is that you don't get just one product out of the seaweed like carrageenan.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:39):**  There's actually other foods, feeds and fertilizers that can come off of the product, come off  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:45):**  the seaweed and generate multiple products with multiple revenue streams.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:49):**  So we see that as really a key part of creating value, if you will, from the bounty that is  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:55):**  nature's bounty of creating these wonderful seaweeds.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:58):**  And that's really key not only for the quarter million seaweed farmers in the Philippines,  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:03):**  but there's more than two million seaweed farmers in Indonesia that are also in the  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:06):**  same situation.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:08):**  And so it's something that once we get it right in the Philippines, we can take to other  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:11):**  countries and really enable that to work.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:14):**  That said, we're going through a series of engineering steps to get up from a very small  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:17):**  scale irrigation farm, which we have now, up to a hectare scale, which is actually the  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:23):**  standard size of farm that any seaweed farmer is allowed to have in the Philippines.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:28):**  By registering, you can basically get a permit for a hectare and each member of a farmer's  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:35):**  family can have a hectare to grow and develop on their own.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:39):**  So that hectare size family farm is really a key model for us because we're seeing this  
**[0:36:45-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:45):**  as a sustainable cash flow size that's manageable by an individual or a family and yet can produce  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:53):**  positive returns over time.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:55):**  And part of our developing of a biorefinery that would be transportable is really to identify  
**[0:37:02-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:02):**  enough of the value chains to really make this a worthwhile enterprise for families  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:10):**  around the world to undertake either.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:14):**  It's amazing how quickly the water gets deep near the Philippines.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:18):**  You could be a kilometer offshore and be in 200 to 300 meters of water, which is enough  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:22):**  to do the upwelling that's needed.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:25):**  And so literally, these sardine fishermen go out and hang out on the marine permaculture  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:29):**  and go fishing for sardines.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:31):**  And this is within the normal range of their sardine fishing boats.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:34):**  So they go out around sunset.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:36):**  They spend most of the evening out there fishing for sardines.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:41):**  And then they come back in afterwards.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:44):**  And what's interesting is that the marine permacultures themselves are the central focus  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:48):**  point for the sardine fishermen to go because it's much easier to harvest the sardines around  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:54):**  the marine permaculture than it is to try to find them elsewhere.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:58):**  So to me, that's a very good natural sign.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:00):**  And we see millions of sardines hanging out at the marine permaculture.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:04):**  And we have evidence that it's regenerative because we actually find squid eggs and juvenile  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:09):**  fish that are younger than our deployment of the marine permaculture that are growing.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:13):**  It's actually a nursery.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:14):**  I've had several of our interns come out with us and they say, this is a nursery.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:20):**  These fish are just growing here.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:22):**  And it's just kind of a revelation to realize when you actually go snorkeling on the marine  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:26):**  permaculture just how regenerative it is.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:28):**  I mean, people kind of wonder, oh, maybe you're just attracting fish.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:32):**  Maybe they're coming from elsewhere.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:33):**  But anecdotally, when we go diving, we know we're growing more fish.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:37):**  And furthermore, with isotopic stable isotope studies, we'll be able to demonstrate that  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:42):**  these fish grew up on the marine permaculture because the upwelling water has different  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:47):**  isotope ratios.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:48):**  And so we'll be able to distinguish between the fish that just showed up and the fish  
**[0:38:51-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:51):**  that have been growing and living there.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:53):**  And so that's a really key aspect as well.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:55):**  But ultimately, it's all about getting to hectare scale and making it practical for  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:59):**  the seaweed fishermen farmer family to get out there and basically keep an eye on their  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:03):**  marine permaculture, do some fishing, and harvest every 45 days with a new seaweed crop  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:09):**  that they can take to market.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:10):**  Sounds like there's just so much potential in this.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:13):**  And I'm wondering how you pitched this concept to the local people in the area where you  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:17):**  did this initial project.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:20):**  What was the strategy of communicating the potential benefits and getting them comfortable  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:28):**  with the idea of doing things in a different way than they had traditionally?  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:31):**  Well, initially, we did go to the mayors.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:34):**  And they were actually very familiar with the seaweed farming.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:37):**  Because the seaweed farming has occurred since the 1970s in the central Visayas region, all  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:41):**  the way down to Mindanao and even up towards Luzon.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:45):**  And so there is quite a tradition of growing seaweeds.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:48):**  But the plight of the seaweed farmer has been well known that the water is getting warmer  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:53):**  and warmer, the nutrient levels are too low.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:56):**  And it's part of global warming.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:58):**  And the reality is, unless we restore overturning the circulation of that deep water, we're  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:03):**  not going to get the production of seaweeds that we once had.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:06):**  So when we explain this to some of the local mayors of the communities in the Visayas,  
**[0:40:10-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:10):**  they were all in.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:11):**  I mean, literally, we got a permit in six to eight weeks.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:15):**  Not only one, but two or three communities came in with this.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:18):**  And I've got to share with you a story that during the COVID-19 pandemic, everything was  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:25):**  getting shut down.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:26):**  In fact, in the Philippines, it was almost a military lockdown.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:28):**  But when we talked with, we met again with the Coast Guard, with the local barangay,  
**[0:40:33-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:33):**  and with the local fishing communities and the local fisheries groups.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:40):**  And they realized how essential the seaweed farming research was going to be to the livelihoods  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:47):**  of these local seaweed farmers.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:49):**  They just deemed our operation as an essential industry, right?  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:53):**  Because it's producing food.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:56):**  And so we were deemed an essential industry.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:58):**  And right in the middle of a military lockdown, we got approval from the Coast Guard, from  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:03):**  the local barangay, and the local fisheries to be operating our marine permaculture offshore.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:09):**  And we were careful, we kept things under quarantine.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:12):**  But we effectively were able to demonstrate the superior growth of these red seaweeds  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:19):**  to deep water irrigation, two or three times the growth that we would see with normal baseline  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:25):**  growth during that time of year with red seaweeds that were not irrigated.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:30):**  So it's amazing.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:31):**  And I've got to share with you also, the sardine fishermen started fishing around our system  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:37):**  like just days after we got out there.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:39):**  I mean, it was just like they were all in.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:41):**  This was a very quick adoption.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:43):**  And now we've had seaweed farmers come over from the other islands and come and work with  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:47):**  us to learn and train how to operate the marine permaculture, how to work it so that they  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:52):**  could then take this knowledge back to their villages and be able to use marine permaculture  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:58):**  irrigation services to really regenerate the production that was in the previous decades  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:04):**  but is now compromised by climate disruption.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:08):**  And is there a funding mechanism to help them get their own operation started on their separate  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:14):**  islands?  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:16):**  We need to build towards that.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:17):**  We've been in discussions with the World Bank and with the International Finance Corporation  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:23):**  to really help finance these projects as we scale them to Hector scale and beyond.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:29):**  But we need to develop this institutional finance with the World Bank, it would come  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:32):**  through the state and local governments where we can enable communities to effectively finance  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:39):**  the irrigation services that are needed for these seaweed farms to thrive.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:43):**  And so we're going to have to, we're building to Hector scale now and with that demonstrated  
**[0:42:48-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:48):**  then we need to develop effectively a clean development mechanism of sorts of a new kind  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:55):**  and that is enabling these sustainable businesses to thrive.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:58):**  And so we see a public-private partnership as really being key in this area and we're  
**[0:43:03-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:03):**  actually raising private funds to enable this entire marine permaculture industry to thrive  
**[0:43:10-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:10):**  and we're going to build an alliance of organizations around the world that can effectively utilize  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:17):**  this technology, improve it and fold those improvements back into the global association  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:22):**  so that we can make the progress that the earth needs in order to address our carbon  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:26):**  budget in time.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:27):**  Not to mention food security, the food security in the ecosystem comes first but then we want  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:33):**  to measure the carbon balance from this regenerative intervention as well.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:38):**  Yeah, of course it seems like there's so many ways that you can be analyzing this for the  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:42):**  myriad benefits that it has in a holistic sense and to expand on what you were talking  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:47):**  about on improving the technology, I know that you had mentioned before we started the  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:51):**  interview that you're starting to integrate bamboo materials into the materials that make  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:58):**  up the infrastructure, the engineering aspect of these underwater farms.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:04):**  Can you first, I guess, tell me about what components it requires and then how you're  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:08):**  integrating the new materials in with that?  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:12):**  Well we have to build, you know, particularly in the Visayas, you've got doldrums to deal  
**[0:44:17-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:17):**  with and when it gets really hot and sunny and you've got doldrums, you have, I mean,  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:24):**  our marine permaculture design is designed to be able to utilize wave energy offshore,  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:28):**  be able to utilize wind energy in the higher latitudes and be able to even utilize ocean  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:33):**  thermal energy in the future.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:35):**  But when it comes to the doldrums, you're really dealing with solar energy, that's the  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:39):**  strongest correlation.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:41):**  So we're looking at and developing marine solar platforms that can power the solar irrigation  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:47):**  pumps effectively.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:48):**  And so we've got these solar irrigation systems but they need to be above the water surface  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:53):**  and then the seaweed platforms need to be below the surface and we've got a deep water  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:57):**  irrigation pipe that's coming up from the deep.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:59):**  It turns out there's a, you know, proven high density polyethylene has been a proven structural  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:05):**  material for 50-year timescales in these undersea platforms, so it works really well underwater.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:11):**  But then above water, it gets really hot and it turns out the bamboo in some ways does  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:16):**  better as a structural material above the water surface because it's flexible, it's  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:20):**  adjustable and it can withstand the heat pretty well.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:23):**  In fact, it can withstand the heat better than the polyethylene.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:26):**  So below the water surface, the polyethylene works great and above the water surface, the  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:30):**  bamboo works really well.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:31):**  So we're finding this combination to be one of the best practices where, you know, in  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:36):**  flexibility there is strength and flexibility is all about bamboo.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:42):**  Polyethylene is very flexible as well and we need to build these flexible structures  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:48):**  that can withstand the rigors of nature and that appears to be a combination of bamboo  
**[0:45:54-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:54):**  and polyethylene underwater.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:56):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:45:57):**  It makes total sense because I've researched for quite a long time different treatment  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:01):**  methods for bamboo in order to extend its life in use in buildings and one of the oldest  
**[0:46:06-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:06):**  traditional methods is soaking it in seawater and getting a saline solution into the capillary  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:13):**  system on the inside that replaces the carbohydrates or at least salinates them sufficiently so  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:18):**  that they're not attracted to bugs and fungus.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:21):**  And so it just, it seems like it's all coming full circle to use it as a building material  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:26):**  in this innovative context but still kind of integrated into a way that utilizes a traditional  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:33):**  way of preserving the material for even longer.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:36):**  Exactly and it's, you know, it's all about sustainable development.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:39):**  What amazed me is I just put in a request for a quote on a pallet of solar panels from  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:43):**  China and we're down to 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour, per kilowatt and so that's like this  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:49):**  new low, right, 18 cents a watt.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:52):**  It's just like I couldn't believe it and it's like okay, what can we do to use that, you  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:46:57):**  know, very inexpensive resource and some local materials like bamboo and create a platform  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:03):**  that can enable really excellent balance of system costs so that we can build a simple  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:09):**  solar irrigation system that doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg and it can be very  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:14):**  effective at hectare scale.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:16):**  This is really exciting.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:17):**  Now one thing that I was interested in is in a previous interview that I did with Enric  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:21):**  Sala, the founder of the Pristine Seas Project with National Geographic, he told me that  
**[0:47:26-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:26):**  conservation is actually the most economical way of regenerating marine ecosystems.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:32):**  Basically that leaving certain areas alone is enough to allow them to bounce back.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:37):**  You're talking about taking a more active role in sort of kick-starting these damaged  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:41):**  ecologies.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:42):**  What are the advantages of a more active approach and is it absolutely necessary in most of  
**[0:47:48-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:48):**  these marine contexts?  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:50):**  Well we have to start with doing fear of bad things in the ocean but if you talk to Alan  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:54):**  Savory on land-based examples, that wasn't enough.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:57):**  In other words, they went to conservation in Africa and even in the US and they put  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:03):**  fences around the land and they watched the land die slowly and that really wasn't enough.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:09):**  But Alan Savory and the Savory Institute has done incredible work to show that it's the  
**[0:48:14-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:14):**  combination of suitable rotational grazing, suitable land management, and actually hoofed  
**[0:48:22-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:22):**  animals which get moved around.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:24):**  They spend one or two days on a particular patch of pasture and then they get moved.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:29):**  They get moved naturally by predators but if we don't have the predators, you've got  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:32):**  to move them as a farmer.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:34):**  Maybe a drone will move them in the future.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:37):**  And you keep them rotating, right?  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:38):**  And like the goats that we love, you basically keep the goats on one pasture for one day  
**[0:48:44-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:44):**  and then 29 days of recovery.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:46):**  And that is the key because it's the poop and the pee and the hooves breaking the crust  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:51):**  of the soil and then 29 days of recovery, those plants grow back much faster and you  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:56):**  sequester so much more carbon dioxide into the soil.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:00):**  This is a terrestrial example.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:02):**  But that's a case where you need active management to actually bring the earth back to thriving.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:09):**  And similarly, if you let all the animals out, right?  
**[0:49:12-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:12):**  In the last 30 years, we've fished half the fish biomass out of the ocean, right?  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:17):**  And in the last century or so, 90% of the big fish are gone.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:22):**  So it's as if we got a barn, you know, and the barn doors are open, all the animals have  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:28):**  left the barn.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:29):**  If you close the barn door now, you're not going to have any animals inside the barn.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:34):**  So we think that, you know, look, Easter Island was stable as a rainforest.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:40):**  It's also stable as a savanna.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:42):**  And like somebody cut down the last tree on Easter Island and it's not coming back.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:48):**  You know, no matter, no amount of wishing is going to get us back to a rainforest on  
**[0:49:53-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:53):**  Easter Island if there are no trees on Easter Island.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:56):**  So that's where we are in the oceans, right?  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:49:58):**  I mean, the oceans are stable thriving with fish everywhere and they're stable as a dead  
**[0:50:04-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:04):**  ocean, right?  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:05):**  And the reality is we've depleted the sardine fisheries off of Namibia.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:10):**  We've depleted the sardine fisheries off of Northern California, off of Portugal.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:15):**  They're expecting a collapse of the sardine fishery in the next five years.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:18):**  And 18,000 sardine fishermen in Portugal alone will be out of work and a way of life.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:24):**  So unless we find a way to regenerate those sardine fisheries, it's not going to happen  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:29):**  by itself.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:31):**  That's really where marine human culture comes in.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:33):**  That's what it is, right?  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:34):**  We're at the point where these systems are degraded to the point that they are not going  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:39):**  to kind of self-seed without some sort of intervention.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:43):**  And in your example with the rotational grazing pattern, certainly the ideal thing would be  
**[0:50:49-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:49):**  able to reinstate the large herds that made their way along the American savanna.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:50:57):**  And the rotational grazing happens naturally as they're moved around by predators.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:01):**  But given that we fenced off huge portions of the land, that we've removed the predators,  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:06):**  it's not going to happen on its own.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:09):**  And conservation is a concept that works much better if all of the elements are in place  
**[0:51:14-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:14):**  for it to sort of do what it was designed to do.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:17):**  But when those elements are removed, it requires some sort of active intervention in order  
**[0:51:24-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:24):**  to, I guess, mimic the patterns that are required for its health until it can take over on its  
**[0:51:30-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:30):**  own.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:32):**  That's a really good point.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:33):**  And with the sardines, it's fine.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:34):**  You know, if you have a billion sardines, they create their own habitat.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:37):**  They do just fine.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:39):**  But if you don't have a billion sardines, how do you get to a billion sardines?  
**[0:51:42-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:42):**  And I've seen time and again, diving, free diving on kelp forests, the sardines living  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:47):**  in the kelp.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:48):**  And that's a really key insight that until they get to their bigger populations, they  
**[0:51:53-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:53):**  need to use a habitat like a kelp forest to actually regenerate.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:51:57):**  And that's where we really came upon the inspiration that we move from fewer bad things in the  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:02):**  ocean, which are important and necessary but not enough, to doing more good things in the  
**[0:52:07-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:07):**  ocean.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:08):**  And that's our vision for marine permaculture, to regenerate the ecosystem services that  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:12):**  are provided by the diminishing kelp forests, which are 95% depleted in Northern California  
**[0:52:17-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:17):**  and they're 95% gone in Eastern Tasmania.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:19):**  If we regenerate those ecosystem services offshore, we can regenerate the kelp forest,  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:25):**  the associated services, and ultimately bring back the habitat for those sardine fisheries  
**[0:52:31-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:31):**  and ultimately the sardine fisheries themselves.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:33):**  Now it seems like you've got a pretty good overview of the way that these ecosystems  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:40):**  that you're creating through the marine and even the freshwater farming enterprises ties  
**[0:52:45-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:45):**  in with a larger holistic system and the health of that system, both economic and ecological.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:54):**  Can you tell me how you envision marine farming enterprises functioning as part of a regenerative  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:52:59):**  economy and what benefits they can bring beyond the products that they produce and the money  
**[0:53:03-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:03):**  earned?  
**[0:53:04-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:05):**  Well, to start with, we've got the family-sized hectare farm that can work from Australia  
**[0:53:11-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:11):**  to Philippines to Indonesia to the Americas even.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:14):**  And those can be relatively close to shore.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:17):**  And in many places, you've got access to deep water not very far away.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:21):**  And so that's accessible by a family-sized farm.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:23):**  And I think that can provide a really sustainable and local community-level benefit that would  
**[0:53:29-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:29):**  be awesome.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:31):**  Then further offshore, and we've got 300 kilometers of exclusive economic zone, you can have 100  
**[0:53:36-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:36):**  hectares on a larger commercial scale that can really address major needs that are present  
**[0:53:43-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:43):**  when it comes to feeds that can eliminate most of the enteric methane of ruminant livestock.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:50):**  We've got larger fertilizer applications for row crops, hundreds of millions of acres in  
**[0:53:55-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:53:55):**  the United States alone, but certainly India and Asia as well.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:02):**  And the opportunity to address food, half of the seaweed that's harvested is used for  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:08):**  food today.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:09):**  And we're looking forward to developing new food products that will be transformational  
**[0:54:12-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:12):**  as well.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:13):**  So those are some of the direct economic benefits that occur.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:16):**  But then furthermore, when it comes to ecosystem services, so much of it, it's really about  
**[0:54:21-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:21):**  the health of the kelp forest.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:23):**  And that has to do with this habitat that there are thousands of species that rely upon  
**[0:54:28-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:28):**  the kelp forest for some part of their life cycle.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:31):**  And when you have that habitat offshore, it can work well, especially during our times  
**[0:54:35-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:35):**  of climate disruption.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:36):**  Between the years of 2015, 2016, we had a major warm blob, a heat wave, a marine heat  
**[0:54:43-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:43):**  wave come down from Alaska and really shut down some of the upwelling of the California  
**[0:54:48-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:48):**  current.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:49):**  And between that and a strong El Nino of 2015, 2016, it really devastated the kelp forests  
**[0:54:55-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:55):**  that were.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:54:56):**  And without having these kind of kelp forest ecosystem services offshore that could be  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:01):**  using this irrigated upwell water to work well, the kelp forests were devastated.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:07):**  We lost 90% of the kelp forest, and the net result was a loss of a factor of 10 in the  
**[0:55:12-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:12):**  sardine population, a loss of thousands.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:15):**  Most of the seals and sea lions were lost, and tens of thousands of seabirds were lost  
**[0:55:21-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:21):**  as well.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:22):**  And so it was really a collapse of the ecosystem offshore during those years, and we saw thousands  
**[0:55:28-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:28):**  of sea lions starving to death.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:30):**  So it was a very severe situation.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:32):**  And if you have these kind of ecosystem services offshore, we'll be able to survive the next  
**[0:55:37-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:37):**  marine heat wave, the next El Nino, with far greater resilience because the sardines will  
**[0:55:43-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:43):**  have a place to go.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:44):**  The sea lions will have some sardines to eat, and the seabirds, again, will have some of  
**[0:55:49-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:49):**  the sea life to eat as well.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:51):**  As a result, even if we lost our nearshore kelp forests, we could have those regenerative  
**[0:55:58-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:55:58):**  kelp forest ecosystem services available offshore on marine permacultures that could ensure  
**[0:56:03-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:03):**  better resilience to survive the next marine heat wave.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:06):**  That gives a really good idea of just how urgent this work is, seen as these types of  
**[0:56:12-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:12):**  events are becoming more common all the time.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:15):**  They are.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:16):**  They're really essential.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:17):**  And you know, it goes further because in tropical areas, we can do marine permaculture growing  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:20):**  seaweed in the tropics.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:22):**  But while we're actually irrigating the seaweed, we're actually also cooling off the mixed  
**[0:56:26-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:26):**  layer of the ocean.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:27):**  And when we do that, just half a degree or one degree Celsius, that's enough to prevent  
**[0:56:31-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:31):**  coral reefs from bleaching and to actually reverse their coral bleaching.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:35):**  We've demonstrated since 2009 the fact that these coral reefs in the summer are living  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:40):**  within one degree of mortality.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:43):**  And by cooling off just a half a degree to one degree during the hot summer months, these  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:47):**  corals can continue to survive and even thrive.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:51):**  And so we see marine permaculture as a model to not only producing a sustainable seaweed  
**[0:56:56-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:56:56):**  harvest but actually cooling some high-value reefs enough to keep those key reef ecosystems  
**[0:57:02-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:02):**  alive during the difficult years and decades to come.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:06):**  It can keep things going long enough that those surviving reefs can become the diaspora  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:12):**  that will lead to reef propagation globally once we get our carbon budget back into balance.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:17):**  And I'm curious, what are some of the barriers that are preventing the active regeneration  
**[0:57:22-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:22):**  of marine ecosystems right now?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:24):**  Well, some of the challenges is it's fairly capital intensive to develop the initial stages.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:30):**  And so we are in the process of raising that capital.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:33):**  In fact, we had a successful crowdfunder in Australia that raised two-thirds of a million  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:37):**  dollars for Australian kelp forests.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:39):**  And now we're in the phases of a crowdfunder in the US in conjunction with the 2040 film.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:46):**  We've been doing a crowdfunder and I'm very happy to say that this year we'll be able  
**[0:57:51-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:51):**  to announce achieving the first milestone, which is a quarter million dollars, to raise  
**[0:57:55-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:57:55):**  towards a thousand square meter seaweed forest that'll be deployed in the Pacific Ocean.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:00):**  So we have a crowdfunder on our website, climatefoundation.org, and it's under the 2040 heading.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:05):**  And this is a crowdfunder that everyone can contribute and we've got small and large donations  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:09):**  going in.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:11):**  But we're reaching our first milestone this year and we're looking forward to scaling  
**[0:58:14-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:14):**  towards that thousand square meters.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:16):**  So it's a way to effectively build the capital that we're going to need to build to show  
**[0:58:22-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:22):**  the thousand square meter system works, that we can get up to a hectare, show that it's  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:26):**  economically sustainable, and then replicate that hectare scale family farm across the  
**[0:58:31-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:31):**  Pacific Ocean.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:32):**  Wow.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:33):**  Wow.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:34):**  This is really exciting stuff.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:37):**  And yeah, I just I feel like I've learned so much in this short interview.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:41):**  How can listeners learn more and even participate in marine permaculture projects or perhaps  
**[0:58:47-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:47):**  even start one themselves?  
**[0:58:50-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:50):**  Well check out our website because we've got on it some ideas on how to get involved, how  
**[0:58:54-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:54):**  to participate.  
**[0:58:55-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:58:55):**  We're interested in developing local communities that want to develop marine permaculture.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:00):**  And we're actually working with a number of volunteers around the world to actually reach  
**[0:59:07-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:07):**  out, get involved, and participate.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:10):**  And so whether it's donating some time, contributing time and effort, sweat equity if you will,  
**[0:59:18-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:18):**  or if you don't have time, contributing to the fundraiser that would enable us to get  
**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:23):**  to the thousand square meter scale and get to that family size hectare.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:27):**  Those are our aspirations for the future.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:29):**  Check out the film 2040, which is a really wonderful description of the hopeful view  
**[0:59:33-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:33):**  of our future in 2040.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:34):**  And we're very happy that marine permaculture is one of several solutions that are featured  
**[0:59:39-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:39):**  in the 2040 film.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:40):**  Yeah, I saw that one.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:42):**  You guys did a great job in explaining through that medium.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:46):**  And I hope it definitely continues to get seen by more people as an inspirational resource.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:51):**  Well, look, Brian, it has been fantastic to talk to you about this.  
**[0:59:55-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:55):**  I can tell that we can go on for a whole lot longer and there's so much more information  
**[0:59:59-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:59:59):**  to share, but perhaps we'll leave it for a second session.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:03):**  Can you give some more contact information as to how people can find out very specifically  
**[1:00:09-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:09):**  about how to get projects started in this way?  
**[1:00:13-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:13):**  Yes.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:14):**  Well, I would start with climatefoundation.org.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:17):**  They can send an email to info at climatefoundation.org.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:20):**  And we're happy to talk with them about how we can get these capacity built and how we  
**[1:00:27-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:27):**  can effectively replicate the hectare scale family marine permaculture across the oceans  
**[1:00:34-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:34):**  and really become the future that the Earth needs in order to feed the world, in order  
**[1:00:38-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:38):**  to regenerate life in the oceans, and in order to balance our carbon budget in a practical  
**[1:00:43-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:43):**  time scale.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:44):**  Well, there you have it, everybody.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:46):**  Let's get started.

**[1:00:49-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brian-von-herzen/#t=1:00:49):**  Brian, thank you so much for taking the time today.

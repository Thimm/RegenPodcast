**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:02:29):**  Krawczyk about the practice of coppicing woody perennial plants and woodland management as  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:02:34):**  a whole.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:02:35):**  Now, for a quick recap, Mark Krawczyk is the author of the new book, Coppice Agroforestry,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:02:40):**  Tending Trees for Product, Profit, and Woodland Ecology.

**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:13):**  Now, despite the focus on coppice agroforestry systems that this conversation continues to  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:18):**  revolve around, Mark and I also go into a wide array of other topics, including the  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:23):**  long history of forestry management in indigenous cultures around the world, understanding invasive  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:28):**  species, woodland products and small craft economies, fire mitigation strategies, and  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:33):**  a whole lot more.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:34):**  So, this is the second of the two-part episode, and if you missed the first portion, I highly  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:40):**  recommend you go back and have a listen, because it's really worthwhile and it'll also  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:43):**  help to put more of what we're talking about today into context.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:48):**  Another bonus that comes along with this episode is that, thanks to New Society, the publishers  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:53):**  of this book, I'll be offering a free volume of Coppice Agroforestry to listeners of the  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:58):**  show.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:03:59):**  And yes, even though I first announced this last week, there is still a chance to win.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:03):**  So be sure to stay tuned until the end of this episode, where I'll let you know how  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:07):**  you can win your very own copy.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:10):**  Now with all of that out of the way, I will hand things over to Mark Krawcheck.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:14):**  Yeah, I'm really hoping that with a lot of what is happening in current events, we  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:20):**  could talk about the heat waves and the ensuing fires that are happening right now here in  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:25):**  Europe and other ecological emergencies, it's starting to open up the space for better forestry  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:31):**  management finally.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:33):**  And I'm starting to hear conversations happening from clients, even at political levels about,  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:40):**  okay, what are we going to do about the forest now?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:43):**  They're becoming either a liability for having left them for so long or best case scenario,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:50):**  it's just like, it's something that kind of gets glossed over when we talk about how  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:55):**  to manage land.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:04:56):**  It's either agriculture or it's conservation and there doesn't seem to be much in between  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:00):**  because of how devalued these woodland spaces are.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:04):**  And I think a conversation also needs to start to happen about how the goal, especially with  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:09):**  conservation is not necessarily that we move all of the existing woodlands back into closed  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:14):**  canopy forest with just mature species.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:18):**  Because I think you alluded to this a second ago that there is, it's almost like a bell  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:22):**  curve, right?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:23):**  Where you start from, let's say a clear cut where there's no vegetation, but then you  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:28):**  can also get up to a point of closed canopy dense forestry where there's minimal biodiversity  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:34):**  and that as well, there's very little light reaching the lower levels and there's maybe  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:40):**  perhaps a few large senescent species that are not really contributing and are in need  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:45):**  of rejuvenation.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:46):**  And so there's conversations to be had on both sides of that spectrum, as well as this  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:51):**  increasingly dangerous fuel load that's amassing from woodlands that we've just stopped to  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:05:56):**  manage because it's either niche economies that have kind of gone away for a while or  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:02):**  people just can't be bothered because there's more profitability in the other enterprises  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:05):**  on their piece of land.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:07):**  It's really good to see that this is starting to work its way into the larger conversation  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:11):**  around ecological management.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:13):**  I agreed.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:14):**  And I think that's also one of those arenas where what I hope this book provides readers  
**[0:06:21-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:21):**  is not just the tools and information necessary to apply coppicing in various contexts, but  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:29):**  also a more holistic understanding of forestry to the degree I was able to kind of weave  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:35):**  it in, recognizing that coppicing is a tool in our toolkit, but there's a lot of other  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:40):**  really valuable, relevant tools that we can use and that not all tools are appropriate  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:46):**  in all contexts.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:47):**  So coppicing isn't necessarily better than a selection type high forest management, like  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:55):**  continuous canopy cover approach.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:06:58):**  In the right application, having that multi-storied complex strata, super diverse, but dense canopy  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:08):**  cover is going to be optimal.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:11):**  But in other situations, it can become something that's really limiting to biodiversity.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:16):**  For example, we've got patches in our woodlot, we've got 40 acres of woods and about a third  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:23):**  of it was abandoned.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:25):**  It was pasture up until the 1960s and then it was left to regenerate.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:30):**  And around us, what you'll tend to see as the pioneer canopy species are quaking aspen  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:36):**  and white pine.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:38):**  And so now we're at a point where we've got 80, 100 foot tall white pines, most of which  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:42):**  have branches from all the way down to the bottom, they're 12 to 18 inches in diameter,  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:49):**  but they have zero market value because the lumber is really low grade given all the knots.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:07:55):**  But for us, we're happy to make lumber out of that or make building timbers or whatever.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:00):**  So the US Department of Agriculture has some great grant programs out there through their  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:05):**  conservation stewardship program.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:07):**  And we were actually given funds to monetize this management through the lens of habitat  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:15):**  diversity creation, a patch cut, a one to two acre clear cut as a way to do just what  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:21):**  you're talking about, which is kind of this intentional but targeted disturbance just  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:26):**  to create some edge, to create some diversity instead of having eight acres of all this  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:31):**  kind of closed canopy white pine with very little growing in the understory.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:34):**  Now we've got this patch that basically it gave rise.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:38):**  So some of it what's happened in there is coppice.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:40):**  There was a small patch of the quaking aspen trees that now became about a half of that  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:47):**  patch is aspen that's 10 feet, 15 feet tall, tens of thousands of stems that came up, which  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:53):**  is fantastic browse and habitat for all sorts of wildlife that appreciate those kind of  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:08:59):**  more full sun conditions.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:01):**  And so just in again, that same way of this kind of cut and come again, patch scale disturbance,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:09):**  we can apply these ideas without necessarily being concerned about it being coppice.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:15):**  It's that targeted rejuvenating disturbance that really comes into the mix here.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:22):**  But yeah, it's encouraging to see forested landscapes being recognized for their ecosystem  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:31):**  services as well as the wood products they provide.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:33):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:34):**  And that's one of the things that I love about your book is that though it is focused on  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:38):**  coppice agroforestry, it gives its dues to many different types of forestry management  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:43):**  and how they fit into essentially a mosaic way of managing based on the necessity, the  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:50):**  context and all of the other factors needed to do so in a regenerative way instead of  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:54):**  making a recommendation that, okay, this works and it has worked for a long time.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:09:58):**  So it will work for you no matter where you are.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:01):**  Sometimes we can fall into that mindset as well.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:03):**  And that kind of comes to how forestry is looked at now.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:08):**  You mentioned a little bit about how it's shifted in the past and why coppice agroforestry  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:13):**  has nearly gone extinct for a period.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:17):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:18):**  When did the shift in mindset or the practices come about and was it mostly technology or  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:24):**  access to other fuels?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:25):**  And also how is it starting to make a revival, a resurgence again in modern times?  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:31):**  Yeah, great question.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:33):**  So a theme that I think is really fascinating, it's built into the history was that one of  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:42):**  the primary products that coppice stands provided like through the middle ages was charcoal.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:49):**  And charcoal represents this kind of energy dense value added concentration of heating  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:56):**  potential but also it was essential for industry.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:10:59):**  And so there's a figure in the book, I think it comes from Oliver Rackham, who's a historical  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:07):**  ecologist from the UK.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:08):**  We're talking about 2000 years ago, he talks about one district in what was then Roman  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:14):**  Britain that would have required an estimated 23,000 acres of coppice to sustain the military  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:21):**  ironworks.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:22):**  So industry had a ravenous appetite for fuel and it was essential.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:27):**  And so he actually posits that if it were not for industry, it's very likely that much  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:33):**  of at least the British Isles, but I could imagine this would have extended to the European  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:37):**  continent would have been cleared of forests because for many people, the need to grow  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:41):**  food was at least as important as their need for wood products.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:46):**  And so kind of counterintuitively industry sustained the forest.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:51):**  And I think that's a really key thread to the relevance today as well, which is the  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:11:57):**  economy is an essential part of the plan for your management.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:03):**  And it's not to say that every patch needs to make money, but we need to think about  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:08):**  how there's that kind of reciprocity that either the ecosystem services are providing  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:14):**  adequate value, et cetera.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:16):**  So given that industry was really the primary consumer of these wood products through time,  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:24):**  it wasn't so much of coal being discovered as a resource, but it was more the transport  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:29):**  infrastructure to enable coal to be moved long distances that really started to usher  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:35):**  the decline of Coppice, at least in the UK.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:40):**  Because it became, you know, the mining industry, as opposed to this kind of more complex husbandry  
**[0:12:46-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:46):**  of woodland management was just that much more simplified and provided a lot of opportunity  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:12:56):**  to extend the reach of production beyond its proximity to a nearby forest, et cetera.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:03):**  And so it appears that coupled with what ultimately was the undermining of the commons, going  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:12):**  back to some of that discussion we had on the feudal system and the nature of, you know,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:19):**  the commoners access to land, what we started to see again, this is British history, although  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:23):**  I think there's corollaries through a lot of Europe, was this move toward the toward  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:29):**  enclosure, which essentially required landowners to partition off their property in order to  
**[0:13:35-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:35):**  maintain ownership of it, which meant that the villagers were increasingly being walled  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:43):**  off from access to the resources they needed, which, you know, that coupled with the rise  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:47):**  of industry meant that there was this kind of migration towards the cities.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:51):**  People were being removed from landscape.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:54):**  And so that's where we started to see kind of the demonetization of a lot of these like  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:13:59):**  cottage industries and crafts, as well as the more subsistence lifestyles that people  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:04):**  achieved.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:06):**  And then with a major industry kind of switching fuel sources in relatively short period of  
**[0:14:12-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:12):**  time, you know, all of those converging forces seem to really have begun to transition the  
**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:21):**  values ascribed to coppice woods, coupled also with we see a transition over time of  
**[0:14:29-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:29):**  lengthening harvest rotations and higher proportions of standard trees, the value of whole wood  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:38):**  became less and less as land was consolidated and technologies kind of caught up with the  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:44):**  ability to process and move materials.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:46):**  So we started to see this longer and longer rotation length and less trees being managed  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:53):**  for sprouts in that interim.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:14:56):**  So all of those forces started to create this transition to the point whereby the early  
**[0:15:04-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:04):**  20th century or mid 20th century coppicing had really largely been not quite forgotten,  
**[0:15:12-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:12):**  but kind of relegated to, you know, much more niche periphery of a lot of these woodland  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:20):**  management practices.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:22):**  There were a few directions I was going with this, but I wanted to start off with the economy  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:26):**  piece.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:27):**  You asked a really good question.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:28):**  And now reorient me here for a second.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:31):**  Yeah, no, I'm trying to think what my question is because I was trying to bring it like full  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:36):**  circle, right, and why it's relevant in modern times, even though it has been mostly replaced  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:41):**  by fossil fuels and larger industry and the technology that makes it easier to harvest  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:46):**  and process large, large dimensional lumber.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:49):**  How do you see it fitting into future management or present management even?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:54):**  Yeah, what are the technologies?  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:57):**  Great.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:15:58):**  So that that is a good thread tying together my last answer there, which is that first  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:04):**  off, I think it's essential that again, we have clear defined needs.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:11):**  I think the what, like what is coppicing once we get that, that's almost superfluous to  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:16):**  the why.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:17):**  The why is the most important reason for us to apply these techniques.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:25):**  And there's essentially, you know, this untapped potential for using pole wood products that  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:33):**  is limited really only by our imaginations.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:36):**  And so I think when it comes to the modern relevance increasingly, like I came to coppicing  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:44):**  learning about this sort of systematized rotation.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:46):**  Maybe you'd have a 10 acre patch and you're going to cut one acre a year for 10 years.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:51):**  And ideally the materials you want are going to be have reached that size after 10 years.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:16:56):**  So you kind of have this perfect rotational system.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:00):**  I think that's a lot less relevant to most people today.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:02):**  First off, because it's going to take sometimes generations to get these systems producing  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:07):**  what they could, especially if you're starting from either open space or you're trying to  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:13):**  kind of transition an existing forest patch into coppice.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:18):**  Also I don't know that it's always the best technique for us to use if we have existing  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:22):**  forest.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:24):**  And so I think it's really a big part of it is reviving this kind of economy of pole wood.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:29):**  It's about recognizing the utility and the value in smaller diameter materials.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:36):**  And then it all comes back to like, how is it meeting either your needs or meeting some  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:41):**  very clear market demand for products?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:45):**  And so there's all kinds of ways that that can play out, I think for a lot of farmers,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:51):**  because one of the challenges is this often tends to be a bit more labor intensive.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:55):**  It's often kind of human scale management.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:17:58):**  And so as we start to scale it up, it becomes more challenging for it to fit some of these  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:03):**  industrial scale approaches to management, although it is possible.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:09):**  But I think some of the ecosystem services that woody plants can provide are some of  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:16):**  the highest value opportunities there.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:18):**  And so I'm thinking about shelter belts and windbreaks, shade for livestock, browse almost  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:24):**  more so than like kind of cut and carry fodder for animals.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:28):**  I think that at the subsistence technique or when you're raising animals at a very small  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:33):**  scale, those can be great strategies.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:35):**  But if you just supplemental fodder that the animals can browse as they have access to  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:39):**  them, fantastic.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:41):**  But again, just like riparian buffers that can be harvested every 15 or 20 years for  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:48):**  wood products.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:50):**  In a lot of cases, as scale increases, complexity has to decrease.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:18:55):**  And so things have to get simpler because it's a few people going in there with chainsaws  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:02):**  and skidding the materials out and it's got to get done in one or two days.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:05):**  Whereas like for someone that makes woven wattle hurdles or baskets, the value proposition  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:14):**  of those types of products is much higher because there's so much labor, more labor  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:17):**  built in.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:18):**  So it's essentially, it's contingent on the skills and vision of the manager, which ideally  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:27):**  then is either tied directly to their own needs or the market demand that they see out  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:32):**  there for products they can produce.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:34):**  And I'm not, it's a little bit of a non-answer in some ways because it's really dependent  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:40):**  on each individual and how it fits into their specific context.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:45):**  But even just the idea of like growing woody biomass for tree crops, I think has potential  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:52):**  prospects.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:53):**  So we see this a little bit, I'm a novice when it comes to centropic agriculture, but  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:19:58):**  the idea of like growing your fertility adjacent to the crop is another way that I can see  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:03):**  some of this.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:04):**  It's not necessarily monetized in the way that some of these traditional practices would  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:08):**  have been, but it's creating more of a closed loop within the farm ecosystem.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:13):**  And I love that this ends up bringing up so many other side conversations when you start  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:19):**  to talk about compost agroforestry, things like what it would look like to revive the  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:25):**  commons of our lands, what it means to involve yourself in a culture that sees the longer  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:32):**  term life cycles of an entire forest and how you pass down skills and knowledge to be able  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:40):**  to go through multiple, let's say 20, 30, 40 year harvest cycles that no one person's  
**[0:20:46-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:46):**  lifespan is going to encompass and the traditions and the festivals that come out of that kind  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:54):**  of a cultural involvement in the ecosystem.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:20:57):**  And of course, what you said too, about how this is very dependent on the context and  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:02):**  the place, the ecosystem that you're managing, how would you say that people could start  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:07):**  to let's say, go into an abandoned woodland and analyze its health or assess it for its  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:14):**  potential for coppice management or a way of getting in there and kind of reviving the  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:21):**  cycles through heavy pruning, palarding, coppicing, whatever it might be, that intervention.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:30):**  So there's several metrics that we can look for in a forest stand to assess suitability  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:39):**  for these practices.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:41):**  It is a little bit of a frontier because there isn't a clear roadmap for like how to create  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:47):**  coppice from existing forest.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:49):**  That the way that those systems, the historic systems we see express themselves over time  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:21:56):**  likely evolved over hundreds of years and they were the result of just kind of this  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:01):**  human landscape interaction that in many cases would have spanned multiple human generations.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:08):**  I think it's really important to recognize, health is a hard thing to pinpoint when it  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:14):**  comes to forest ecology.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:16):**  But if I've got healthy trees that are desirable species, we've got a mix of diameter classes,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:25):**  age classes, there's an understory represented, we've got 12 inch diameter oak trees or 16  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:31):**  inch diameter hemlock trees or something like that.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:34):**  I tend to think of those types of stands as being much better suited to just typical conventional  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:40):**  silvicultural techniques.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:42):**  In most cases, meaning like uneven age selection management where you're maintaining that continuous  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:48):**  cover of canopy and you're identifying individual trees that you're harvesting.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:22:54):**  If the forest was a tree, it's pruning the forest.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:00):**  And I think the ethics of ecoforestry are really foundational to that, one of which  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:05):**  is like the needs of the forest come first.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:08):**  That we're always looking to just remove dead, dying, diseased, weak and the lower value  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:13):**  individuals first.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:15):**  So I would say if it looks like it's diverse, if it appears to be in good relative health,  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:22):**  meaning the trees look strong, you don't see a lot of wound, the canopies look robust and  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:26):**  full, you've got diversity of species and age classes, I would tend to say that's not  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:31):**  a good candidate for coppice.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:33):**  As we get into what would be considered like even aged forest stands where it looks like  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:38):**  everything's more or less at the same point of regrowth, that starts to become something  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:43):**  where it's going to make a lot more sense because you're not interrupting this already  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:48):**  kind of diverse structure and age class that's there.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:52):**  Also traditional coppice systems were very dense.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:23:56):**  So we're talking like six to 10 feet between stools in a stand.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:01):**  And there's a couple reasons for that.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:03):**  One is because you're going to just generate more wood from that same stand.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:06):**  You're kind of optimizing productivity within that patch.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:09):**  Two is you're not leaving all these open niches for other stuff to come in and fill in those  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:14):**  gaps.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:15):**  And then the third reason this would be, it's going to tend to encourage really straight  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:21):**  upright growth with mineral outward branching.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:24):**  And for craft materials, that's very important.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:27):**  So density is something that I'm looking for.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:32):**  If it's, you've got kind of this even age stand where everything's kind of at the same  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:39):**  relative age and height, that could be a good candidate.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:44):**  But if there's a lot of space in between the stems, there's going to be a lot of filling  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:50):**  in that you'd want to do ideally in order to really optimize what's going on in that  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:54):**  patch.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:24:55):**  There's a number of ways you could work your way around that to some degree, this is speculation.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:00):**  This is what I would want to do.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:01):**  If it was my situation would be because you're going to have to open up enough light when  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:07):**  you make your first cut to make sure that those sprouts can grow vigorously.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:12):**  And so that generally means you're going to have to open up a minimum of about a third  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:15):**  of an acre.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:16):**  We're talking like a patch, a hundred feet by a hundred feet, or maybe, you know, a little  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:21):**  bit bigger than that, like at a bare minimum, that's also dependent on how tall is the surrounding  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:25):**  canopy.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:26):**  And usually we'd limit it to like the one to two acre patch cut as far as like the extent  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:31):**  of that scale.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:34):**  But there's a forestry technique called a seed tree cut, where essentially you try to  
**[0:25:40-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:40):**  time your harvest to a year where the desirable tree species are putting out abundant seed.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:48):**  And you're generally leaving a few trees per acre in order to seed into that stand.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:25:55):**  So that would be something like if it was a patch of oak trees, ideally we'd be timing  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:00):**  it with a mast year where the oak tree is going to put out a ton of new seed.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:06):**  And so the forest is planting itself rather than you going in and having to like fill  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:10):**  in these gaps with seedlings you plant.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:13):**  So I'd be looking at the density of the stand.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:15):**  That was the other theme there.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:17):**  And then also the species and the age and the species I'd be looking at.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:21):**  So as we mentioned earlier, most conifers aren't going to coppice.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:24):**  So we've got patches where there's like dense stands of Eastern hemlock.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:30):**  Already that's not a great candidate, unless I wanted to clear that already and try to  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:34):**  flip the species composition there.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:37):**  Which maybe there's a reason to do that.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:39):**  But for me, the beauty of most forestry is that the forest tends to plant itself really  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:45):**  well.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:46):**  And so if we can kind of sail with that, tend the stand rather than kind of impose our will  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:52):**  by planting into the stand, it's less work for us.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:26:56):**  It's a more elegant solution in the long run.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:00):**  And it allows there to be kind of this push pull between people and landscape.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:06):**  And then the third thing I would toss out there too, in terms of assessing suitability  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:10):**  would be, I think this is the fifth thing actually, but I'm calling it the third thing,  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:14):**  would be the age.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:15):**  Which we generally look at the diameter or the height of the tree in order to give us  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:19):**  an idea of what the age is.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:21):**  Because I haven't mentioned this, I think I briefly mentioned it earlier, but as trees  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:27):**  grow older, many species lose the capacity to sprout with vigor.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:33):**  And so beyond 30, 40, 50 years, for many species, they're not going to sprout back with that  
**[0:27:38-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:38):**  same just vitality that they do when they're in their teenage years to maybe 30 years.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:46):**  And it does depend on species.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:49):**  But if you've got a 15 inch diameter stand of white oak trees, they probably will sprout,  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:27:57):**  but they'd probably do it much more aggressively if they were 15 or 25 years.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:04):**  And so that's just another thing to keep in mind is how far along the stand appears to  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:09):**  be if you're anticipating and hoping for sprouting coming from what's already there.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:13):**  Yeah, it's a really important consideration.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:16):**  I'd hate people to go in and start lopping down really large trees with the expectation  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:20):**  that they're going to shoot back up.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:22):**  That's important to know.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:24):**  And you talked a little earlier about the amount of products that can come from this  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:29):**  type of management, all like a huge variety, as well as the marketability of some of it  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:34):**  even in current times.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:37):**  Where do you see perhaps career opportunities in forestry management like this right now?  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:42):**  Are there openings for alternative or historical ways of managing forest?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:48):**  Or is this something that you kind of have to have your own land to make money off of?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:53):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:54):**  Because this brings us back to part of the question I think you last asked, which was  
**[0:28:58-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:28:58):**  kind of land tenure, the succession of like human management on land over time.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:06):**  And I do think that coupled with wildlife pressure and browse on young sprouts, those  
**[0:29:12-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:12):**  are two of the biggest challenges I see to making these practices more widespread.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:20):**  When it comes to land tenure, I think one of the beauties of forested land, and perhaps  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:25):**  this is your experience with these clients you've got there in Spain, is that tons of  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:30):**  people have forest and they have no idea what to do with it, nor do they have the skills,  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:34):**  time, energy, or vision to want to engage with it.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:38):**  So I think in many ways, it is one of the best opportunities for landless or cash poor  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:44):**  people that have skills, vision, and energy to be able to build a relationship with landscape.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:52):**  Because there's just abundant forest that's basically sitting without any intervention  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:29:57):**  at all from people.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:01):**  And so I think that is a great opportunity for someone that has the desire to participate  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:07):**  in land management, but doesn't have the means to buy land.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:14):**  I want to just kind of speak to what you asked a little bit earlier, too, is like, then how  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:17):**  do we kind of ensure that the energy that we're doing, or the effort that we're putting  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:23):**  into this management might be perpetuated in time.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:28):**  And there's not a ton of tools for that, because we don't really have the economic or the social  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:32):**  structures in place to help preserve that.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:34):**  I mean, the nature of private land ownership really complicates this land tenure succession  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:42):**  in time.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:43):**  And that's where land trusts and conservation easements become really important.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:48):**  But that is something that's largely undeveloped in the realm of this kind of succession of  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:54):**  forest management over time.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:30:57):**  The idea of the kind of the long-term low-cost lease, which I think a lot of people have  
**[0:31:03-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:03):**  been using as creating some investment prospect for agroforestry systems for landless folks,  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:13):**  seems like it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:15):**  The 99-year lease or something like that as a mechanism to make sure that if I go in to  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:20):**  manage a property that I don't own, I have some insurance that I'm going to be able to  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:26):**  continue to do that throughout my lifetime.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:30):**  And then as far as job prospects or opportunities for earning livelihood, this again, I think  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:35):**  is where imagination is really essential.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:38):**  Because so many of these products, people don't know about the difference.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:44):**  We grow log-grown shiitake mushrooms, which isn't anything that's that uncommon.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:47):**  But I realize increasingly that there's a story behind the management that people don't  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:52):**  necessarily get when they just buy your product.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:31:56):**  And so there's a degree of education why this is different than mushrooms that are grown  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:00):**  in more of a laboratory setting on substrate that's been sterilized or pasteurized.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:07):**  Not to say there's anything wrong with that, but as we move into some of these other realms  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:10):**  where perhaps we're making woven products or we're making barbecue charcoal or artist  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:17):**  charcoal, it's like you really have to do a lot of education of the customer.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:21):**  You have to build your niche.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:22):**  You have to be a good entrepreneur often because it's not just the product, it's the story,  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:28):**  it's the management, it's what you're doing.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:30):**  And so there's essentially at least two ways you could approach this.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:34):**  One is that, okay, I have this patch of woods that has this resource, what can I do with  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:38):**  it?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:39):**  And so that might be based on the size of the materials.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:42):**  It's often going to be also contingent on the species because some species are better  
**[0:32:46-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:46):**  for certain things than others.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:48):**  So there's, you have the resource, what can you do with it?  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:52):**  And then the other end of it would be, you have the skills, where do you procure that  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:32:56):**  resource or how do you maybe adapt the skills to accommodate the resource you have?  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:02):**  So some of the prospects I think that are, well, first off, I think diversification is  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:07):**  really essential.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:08):**  And this all comes back to the idea of adding value to raw materials.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:12):**  That's kind of the foundation of the polewood economy is that, you know, one person's kindling  
**[0:33:17-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:17):**  is someone else's art project or someone else's, you know, whatever it is, the installation,  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:27):**  that's another form of art project, but it's something that's almost decoupled from like  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:31):**  the actual tangible value.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:33):**  Yet, you know, you might be able to retire on a single installation if you're talented  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:38):**  and creative enough.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:39):**  Whereas for, you know, the typical logger, it wouldn't even be materials worth falling  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:44):**  out of the woods.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:46):**  So just recognizing all of the possible uses of a material and always trying to use them  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:51):**  for their highest potential as one place to begin.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:33:59):**  And then, so that was kind of, I was beginning by outlining these kinds of two different  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:03):**  approaches.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:04):**  You've got skills versus, you know, materials.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:08):**  And I think part of that is just going to be emergent in a design.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:11):**  Like I, as I started to develop my passion working with wood products, I became a chairmaker.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:19):**  So now I'm starting to look for materials that are well suited to that, but maybe I  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:23):**  don't find the materials that I learned to use because I learned to do all the kind of  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:28):**  ribbon split out from often large diameter materials to get there.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:32):**  So I decided, okay, I'm going to start making rustic furniture because that's really well  
**[0:34:36-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:36):**  suited to coppice because you're using wood in the round, you know, small diameter stuff.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:45):**  Proximity to markets is really crucial.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:47):**  I think one of the most lucrative opportunities would be the woody cuts for the floral products.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:34:55):**  Talking about things that have either interesting shapes or colors or flowering species that  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:01):**  can be harvested during dormancy and then brought indoors and the term is forcing so  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:06):**  that they're forced to bloom.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:10):**  Those would be things like hydrangeas or flowering quince or cherries, things like the corkscrew  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:16):**  willows.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:17):**  So you were talking like dollars, you know, three, five, $10 per stem that someone could  
**[0:35:23-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:23):**  generate dozens of dollars, hundreds of dollars off of one coppice stool each season.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:33):**  That really requires proximity to market.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:35):**  So where I am, there's not a huge demand for that sort of thing.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:38):**  So I'm either needing to wholesale to a distributor or travel to a larger population center where  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:44):**  there might be that.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:45):**  Whereas I think like in a more urban environment, there's tons of opportunities for those sorts  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:50):**  of high value niche products.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:53):**  I think obviously like the woven crafts are something that will be with us forever.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:35:59):**  But also within that is just identifying new niches that aren't already exploited.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:03):**  I don't know if there was a tradition of woven caskets that went back in history.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:07):**  I wouldn't be surprised, but I've seen that as kind of this emergent new product, especially  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:12):**  with the increase in interest in green burials.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:16):**  But you know, just creating this space to reinterpret products, looking at the versatility  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:23):**  of materials and not being limited by what's been done in the past.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:27):**  And again, in a lot of ways, this is really a business development proposition.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:33):**  It's, you know, is there demand for this?  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:37):**  Do I want to make it?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:39):**  Can I get the materials?  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:41):**  But I think the sky's really the limit when it comes to, and in our imaginations are also  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:47):**  the limit, the limiting factor for how we can leverage this.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:53):**  And I guess the other thing I would just toss in there is that this to me starts to mark  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:36:58):**  the frontiers of what modern coppice could be, because I often think about it again in  
**[0:37:03-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:03):**  this rotational path scale, clear cut type formal system.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:10):**  Whereas coppicing is something that we can do at the plant level, at the individual level.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:16):**  And so you don't need to have this 10 acre rotation.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:20):**  It could be vacant lots or field margins.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:24):**  There's a guy I met in Michigan in the US 10 years ago.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:29):**  He's got a partnership with someone that owns land along the margins of an interstate.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:33):**  And it's just this wild patch of red Osher dogwood and him and his family, they make  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:36):**  wreaths and other kind of decorative woven products.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:42):**  They don't own the property.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:43):**  They just go in there and they tend this field margin.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:47):**  And I don't know which came first.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:48):**  You know, the product or the relationship to the landscape or to the material, but that's  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:57):**  something that works really well for them.  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:58):**  They're not paying taxes.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:37:59):**  They don't own on the land.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:01):**  They don't have to own it themselves.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:03):**  It's just some wild stand.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:05):**  And you could be doing that just with a small little patch.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:09):**  You know, again, kind of in the back of a vacant lot.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:11):**  So it's really about kind of creativity.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:14):**  It's about, you know, this is where also I look to a lot of the, the, what we often call  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:18):**  like the trash trees or, you know, exotic invasive species, et cetera.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:24):**  Opportunistic plants is huge opportunities because the, the, the kind of dominant paradigm  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:28):**  now is just to try to eradicate these species that are colonizing ecosystems quite readily.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:35):**  And for me, it's like I could battle, or I could try to transform wild forest into something  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:43):**  that I'd like to see it as, or I could try to find opportunities to market things that  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:50):**  people want to eradicate from the landscape in a way where there's this participatory  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:56):**  tending that's going on there.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:38:58):**  It's a much more elegant solution to, you know, invasive control is, is, you know, finding  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:05):**  ways to, to quote unquote, eat, eat the weeds rather than just, you know, beat them.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:09):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:10):**  I've got a perfect example of that is the property that I'm moving on to.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:15):**  They're trying to eradicate black locust from the riparian zone, which I get it.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:20):**  There's there, they're pretty invasive in that context.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:23):**  They can out compete some of the natives that they want to promote, but my goodness is there  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:27):**  ecological and economical potential in that tree.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:30):**  I know you've planted some on your own land, right?  
**[0:39:32-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:32):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:33):**  I mean, it's, it's as a species, it's, it's an all star for sure.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:38):**  It does come with some, some challenges.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:41):**  People don't like the thorniness of the tree.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:44):**  Although that tends to really decline as it gets more mature.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:48):**  And then the, the suckering habit of it, which is the, the nature of a number of species  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:54):**  that coppice vigorously, they'll also send up sprouts from the root system.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:39:57):**  So it tends to want to form a bit of a colony once it's established.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:01):**  And that can be problematic in some cases, but it's a real anomaly in the world of plants  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:07):**  and woody plants because it grows fast, but it's very dense.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:10):**  And we usually don't see those two things overlay on one another.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:15):**  Most of our fast growing species like poplars and willows are, are, you know, very lightweight.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:20):**  And so they tend to be more poor when it comes to fuel sources.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:24):**  And then the other property of black locust, that's fantastic.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:27):**  It's durability.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:29):**  It's just incredibly rot resistant.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:31):**  And then it makes, you know, fragrant blossoms that are fantastic for fodder for bees.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:36):**  It's a really quality forage for livestock and wildlife.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:41):**  And so, you know, there's a lot of potential there, but again, that all comes back to context  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:45):**  too.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:46):**  I mean, if you're trying to do something else, that's not compatible with the species that's  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:51):**  there.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:52):**  Well, in some cases it probably makes more sense maybe to rearrange your goals because  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:40:55):**  you can spend a lot of work fighting what the landscape quote unquote wants to be, or  
**[0:41:00-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:00):**  you can, you know, make lemonade from it and, and and kind of just, you know, stale with  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:10):**  succession rather than motoring against it.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:13):**  Incorporate your goals into the reality rather than trying to force it the other way around.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:17):**  Well said.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:18):**  Well, look, Mark, I could definitely continue this conversation with you for a long time,  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:23):**  but I want to be respectful of your time.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:25):**  Can you tell our listeners, first of all, how they can find the book and how they can  
**[0:41:29-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:29):**  reach out to you and get in touch?  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:31):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:32):**  So I have a few different websites.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:34):**  The book is available on our farm website, which is valleyclayplain.com, C-L-A-Y-P-L-A-I-N,  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:43):**  Clay Plain, which is a nod to the national community that was once ubiquitous in the  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:49):**  part of the world where we live, the Valley Clay Plain Forest.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:53):**  There's a website called Coppice Agroforestry that has some great resources.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:41:58):**  And that's just coppiceagroforestry.com.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:00):**  And then my kind of design and consulting arm of my livelihood is keylinevermont.com.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:09):**  That's not key lime as in pie, but K-E-Y-L-I-N-E, keylinevermont, all spelled out dot com.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:19):**  And was there another thing I was sharing?  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:22):**  Resources or?  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:24):**  Was there something else you wanted to get out there?  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:25):**  So what I was going to say is for for non so currently I'm really only shipping books  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:29):**  to domestically to the states.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:33):**  So for people in Canada, go to New Society Publishers in Europe, we're still finding  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:38):**  kind of the optimal source for that.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:41):**  I've heard people use Booktopia.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:43):**  Local booksellers should be able to order it for you.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:46):**  But the shipping costs are astronomical these days.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:49):**  So I'm not shipping there.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-krawczyk-on-coppice-agroforestry-and-woodland-management-part-2/#t=0:42:50):**  But there's also an e-book available through the publisher, New Society Publishers.

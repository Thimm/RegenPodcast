### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:00):**  Now, the first three interviews in this ongoing series on reforestation and agroforestry have  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:05):**  highlighted small personal projects on private land, each with a different person in South  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:10):**  or Mesoamerica whose primary motivations are to restore the forests and biodiversity of  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:14):**  their land.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:16):**  In all three cases, producing a viable agricultural product was an important aspect of the project,  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:22):**  and one which brought in funds to keep the operation running, but profitable agriculture  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:26):**  wasn't the primary goal for any of them.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:29):**  Now in this interview, I spoke with James Potter with the Inga Foundation, who talked  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:34):**  with me about the work and project model of the foundation.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:38):**  In my own travels, I've seen a lot of slash-and-burn agriculture all over the world, from the rice  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:42):**  paddies of the Philippines, the coffee plantations in cornfields of Guatemala, to cattle ranching  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:47):**  in Mexico and clearings for new palm oil plantations in Thailand and Malaysia.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:52):**  It used to baffle me that such a strategy for land management could still persist in  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:58):**  this day and age.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:01:59):**  A lot of what I've tried to learn about in my time in those places is centered around  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:03):**  how people farmed and managed fertility on their parcels.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:07):**  Now in my talk with James, he helps to explain the origins and motivations for slash-and-burn  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:12):**  farming and the impact that it's had on the soil, as well as the economics for the people  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:16):**  who practice it.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:18):**  From there, we talk about the Inga Foundation's unique approach to integrating Inga trees  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:23):**  and all of their beneficial properties into the farming strategy for people who are used  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:27):**  to burning their land in between crop seasons.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:30):**  We also look into the pilot projects that they've helped to create and the results of  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:34):**  the implementation of this method over time.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:37):**  James also helps to unpack the common challenge of the transition period between the maturation  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:43):**  for longer-term perennial species where yields may be too low for subsistence farmers to  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:47):**  sustain themselves.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:49):**  Now while I remain wary of any plan that promotes a standardized approach across many different  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:53):**  contexts, I've been impressed by some of the fundamental challenges that alley cropping  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:02:58):**  solutions present for helping farmers transition into practices which take much better care  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:03):**  of the soil and biodiversity of their land in the process.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:07):**  Now this is an episode that I would love to hear opinions and feedback from any of you  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:10):**  who are listening, especially if you have personal experience working with alley cropping  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:14):**  systems and intercropping within orchards or other tree plantations.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:19):**  Does the division work against the efficiency of the farm?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:23):**  Can the trees develop to a point where they shade out the crops in the alleys?  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:27):**  How much diversity is beneficial for the trees and crops selected and at what point do they  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:31):**  start to compete for resources like light and nutrients in the soil?  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:36):**  As always, you can leave comments on the website or email me directly at info at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:41):**  Now I'll hand things over to James.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:44):**  Hey James, thanks so much for making time.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:48):**  I know you've got this very busy schedule as a full-time teacher, but I'm really excited  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:53):**  to talk to you about the Inga Foundation.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:56):**  So what do you say we just jump right into the questions?  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:03:59):**  Sounds great Oliver, it's really great.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:01):**  Thank you for having me.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:02):**  I'm looking forward to talking to you today.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:03):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:05):**  Now I've been really excited about the projects and the advancement that this organization  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:13):**  has been able to do for the ecosystems and the communities that it works with.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:17):**  But before we get started with that, could you tell me a little bit about your personal  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:20):**  background and how you started to work with the Inga Alley Cropping Foundation?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:25):**  Sure thing.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:26):**  My involvement with the Inga Foundation began in about 2016 when my mother, who is the secretary  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:32):**  of the Inga Foundation, Lorraine Potter, showed me Dr. Hans' documentary Up in Smoke.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:38):**  And it really opened my eyes to the horror of slash and burn agriculture and the devastating  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:46):**  environmental and ecological effects that it's having really on just ordinary people  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:52):**  who are trying to make a living for themselves and for their families.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:04:57):**  So after I watched this documentary, my mother and I both decided that we were going to try  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:03):**  and get the Inga Foundation, which had been founded as a nonprofit organization in the  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:09):**  United Kingdom in 2007, to get a branch of the Inga Foundation over to the United States.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:16):**  So we worked in 2016 to register the Inga Foundation as a 501c3 in the United States.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:23):**  And we started working pretty much from the ground up from there.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:28):**  I've been working as a grant writer for the Inga Foundation.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:31):**  I've been spreading awareness about the work that Dr. Hans is doing with this incredible  
**[0:05:37-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:37):**  foundation.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:38):**  And I feel really honored to be a part of a solution that's helping hundreds of people  
**[0:05:47-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:47):**  in a part of the world to make a living and to just bring themselves out of poverty and  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:56):**  this environmental devastation that they're dealing with.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:05:59):**  Yeah, fantastic.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:01):**  I have seen the effects of these types of slash and burn agriculture practices around  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:06):**  the world in my own work.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:08):**  So let's focus on that for a second and talk about what the problem is with this agricultural  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:12):**  practice of burning out the understory and the forest of an area in order to use it as  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:19):**  agriculture.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:20):**  Where did this start and how has it become such a dominant practice in many developing  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:25):**  countries?  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:26):**  Well, the thing about slash and burn agriculture is that it's a subsistence farming method.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:32):**  This is really just a method of agriculture that people use to grow basic food crops for  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:38):**  themselves and for their families.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:41):**  It's essentially a decision to eat or not to eat.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:45):**  And when people are put into that situation, they burn a few acres of fertile rainforest  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:53):**  on which to grow their crops.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:06:56):**  And for about a year, the nutrients from the soil and from the burning process feeds their  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:03):**  crops.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:04):**  The problem is that slash and burn agriculture is not a sustainable nor environmentally nor  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:10):**  ecologically friendly method of agriculture.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:13):**  Not only does it contribute billions of tons of carbon to the atmosphere, but because the  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:20):**  soil fertility doesn't last, people's crops fail subsequently.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:26):**  And it forces subsistence farmers to depend on this unsustainable system of agriculture  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:33):**  to keep clearing new acres of rainforest every few years just to survive, which in turn,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:40):**  is just this vicious cycle of destruction and devastation on a global scale.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:46):**  It's not just practiced in places like Honduras where Dr. Hands is doing his work, but it's  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:51):**  practiced in the tropics all over the world.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:07:55):**  And what the Inga Foundation really seeks to do is it seeks to provide these subsistence  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:00):**  farmers with an alternative and a sustainable alternative that will raise them and their  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:07):**  families out of poverty and to give them crops year after year without having to slash and  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:13):**  burn.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:14):**  Now I've seen this, like I said, in some of my own travels and even in the community where  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:18):**  I was living and working up until recently in Guatemala, we had people using slash and  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:24):**  burn techniques in that community, in that valley where we live.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:28):**  And as I came to understand it, now it's not the case in every community around the world,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:33):**  but it came from actually a fairly sustainable practice, which sort of got out of hand where  
**[0:08:39-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:39):**  people would go and burn a small tract of land in the forest and plant mostly perennial  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:47):**  crops like bananas and certain varieties of yuca and such and sort of farm or garden those  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:08:53):**  intensively for a short time until they started to kind of start to dip in fertility and whatnot.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:00):**  And then they would leave that place to sort of biodegrade, regenerate back into forest  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:06):**  and repeat the process within another small area.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:10):**  But now that you know, the global economy is demanding much, much more as far as production  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:17):**  for low wages, like you said, the subsistence model does not allow those places to actually  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:22):**  regenerate and it's come to the point where entire forests have been burnt down for simple  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:28):**  annual crops.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:30):**  And so it seems to me like it's much more of a driver from an unhealthy economic global  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:37):**  model than it is from one where people were doing this for a long time, kind of within  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:43):**  the bounds of what the ecosystem could provide.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:46):**  And so the Inga Alley cropping solution here, can you tell me a little bit about how this  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:52):**  plant was chosen and what were some of the results that gave hope that this could help  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:09:58):**  to remediate or offer solutions for the slash and burn model?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:04):**  Sure.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:05):**  Well, Dr. Hans is a tropical ecologist from Cambridge University.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:11):**  Having talked with him, he is incredibly experienced both on the scientific research and the field  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:18):**  implementation of the Inga model.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:20):**  And he experimented with a lot of different models and tree species over the course of  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:27):**  about 25 years.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:29):**  He arrived at Inga for a number of reasons.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:33):**  And in 2012, he started Inga Alley cropping in Honduras with about a dozen families who  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:43):**  were willing to implement the model.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:46):**  They were a little hesitant to implement the model at first because of course they had  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:52):**  really known no other way of agriculture other than slash and burn agriculture.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:10:59):**  But they implemented the system in 2012.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:02):**  And what happened is that they realized that the Inga model was much better than anything  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:12):**  that they had been doing beforehand for a number of different reasons.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:16):**  The Inga tree, first off, we use a certain species of Inga known as the Inga edulis tree.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:23):**  It's a nitrogen fixing tree such that the tree itself replenishes the soil.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:30):**  So these trees can be planted on soil that has been completely degraded and devastated  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:38):**  by slash and burn agriculture.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:39):**  And they can then regenerate that soil over the course of about two to three years.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:45):**  It takes about one to two thousand trees to fully implement an Inga system, an Inga Alley  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:50):**  cropping system for a subsistence farmer.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:11:55):**  But what happens is that these trees are planted in long rows and in between that's of course  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:03):**  where the crops are planted.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:05):**  And it's not just crops like wheat and beans and corn, but over time families are able  
**[0:12:12-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:12):**  to plant cash crops such as bananas, pineapple, cacao, turmeric, all within these alleys.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:20):**  Another aspect of Inga Alley cropping that made it so appealing to farmers, especially  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:26):**  in the Los Flores region of Honduras where Dr. Hans started his work, is that much of  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:31):**  the land that was burnt was were on these incredibly steep slopes.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:37):**  So what Dr. Hans found is that another huge problem with slash and burn agriculture that  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:44):**  especially with widespread slash and burn agriculture like you talked about is that  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:48):**  soil erosion is a huge problem because even if slash and burn agriculture is done on a  
**[0:12:54-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:12:54):**  small scale, if it's done in areas where the geography is steep and unforgiving, it just  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:04):**  causes rampant erosion which essentially makes it such that the land doesn't have an opportunity  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:09):**  to heal.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:12):**  So the farmers found that the Inga trees were anchoring themselves to these steep slopes  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:18):**  and they were able to plant crops and it prevented the erosion.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:23):**  This was most apparent back in about 2016.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:28):**  There was this massive, massive storm that struck the Los Flores region in Honduras.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:33):**  It was a few years into the implementation of the Inga Alley cropping model.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:38):**  So the alleys were still relatively young and the trees themselves were still relatively  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:44):**  young and it just dumped water.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:46):**  Oh, pardon me, it was in 2015.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:49):**  I got my date slightly wrong.  
**[0:13:51-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:13:51):**  It was in 2015 and what happened was that the farmers noted that their crops, the farmers  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:00):**  who had implemented slash and burn who were still operating under that model, their crops  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:05):**  were just completely washed away by the erosion and just the deluge of water that just swept  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:11):**  their crops away.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:13):**  Whereas farmers who had implemented Inga Alley cropping found that the Inga trees anchored  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:19):**  their crops to the soil such that they were able to still reap their crops and they had  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:26):**  a harvest that year.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:28):**  So that was another advantage of the Inga Alley cropping system.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:31):**  And pardon me, if I'm starting to ramble, Oliver, please feel free to cut me off.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:36):**  No, no, no, you're doing fine.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:37):**  This is a really good illustration of some of the extra benefits of planting trees in  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:42):**  general and not just the in-depth stuff.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:44):**  Oh yeah, and it doesn't stop there.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:47):**  Additionally, since so many of the farmers in the tropics rely not on electricity but  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:14:53):**  on firewood, Inga Alley cropping, Inga Alley cropping as we always say is an integrated  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:00):**  ecosystem and it's true because Inga Alley cropping provides everything for the farmers.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:07):**  Not only do the Inga trees produce a fruit which farmers are able to eat and the seeds  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:12):**  they're able to harvest to share with their neighbors and implement alleys themselves,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:18):**  but part of the Inga Alley cropping process is that once the trees reach a certain height,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:25):**  they have to be pruned.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:26):**  What the pruning does, the pruning part of the operation, farmers strip the leaves from  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:33):**  the branches and they leave the leaves to biodegrade as a mulch to, again, stabilize  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:40):**  the soil so the crops don't wash away.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:43):**  Farmers then take those branches and use those in firewood for cooking.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:48):**  So not only do they have firewood, they have mulch, they have stable soil, they have crops  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:54):**  that are planted in these alleys.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:15:56):**  So what happens is that the Inga Alley cropping model simulates the rainforest without there  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:03):**  actually being that native rainforest on this slash and burn plot of land.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:09):**  It simulates those circumstances so that the farmers no longer need to cut down virgin  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:17):**  rainforest and then continue that unsustainable model.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:21):**  Yeah, and I think a lot of people who are familiar not only with this podcast but with  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:25):**  a lot of permaculture teachings and familiarity with nitrogen fixing crops understand how  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:30):**  every time that a nitrogen fixing tree especially is pruned back, it releases the nitrogen that  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:37):**  was stored that has been sequestered from the air back into the soil and makes it available  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:42):**  to the rest of the plant.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:43):**  So you have a built-in fertilization system.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:46):**  To say nothing of the extra nutrients added to the soil and the water retention ability  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:50):**  of putting a mulch down from having dropped those leaves on top as well.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:54):**  Yes indeed.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:16:55):**  Tell me about some of the crops that the project sites have had success in growing and have  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:02):**  they been able to integrate animal systems in as well.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:07):**  For the most part, the crops that are grown are largely corn and beans which are their  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:13):**  main subsistence crops for families.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:17):**  But cash crops such as pineapple, cacao, turmeric, bananas, black pepper, all of these have been  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:25):**  grown successfully in the Inga alley cropping.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:29):**  Turmeric has been a local favorite simply because of its variety of uses.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:36):**  Even I take a turmeric supplement so I like to think that maybe my turmeric is coming  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:40):**  from the Inga alleys.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:42):**  It's got such a powerful, pardon me, there's so many, the word is failing me.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:17:57):**  The nutrients and the antioxidants from the turmeric.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:00):**  Not just in the turmeric, but really the Inga alley cropping opens the doors for so many  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:05):**  options for subsistence farmers to raise themselves out of poverty.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:10):**  And that's really another great appeal of the Inga alley cropping model is, and that's  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:14):**  what partly Dr. Hands has been doing in Honduras is that he's been raising awareness, and I've  
**[0:18:21-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:21):**  been doing some as well, to really raise awareness for farmers such that slash and burn agriculture  
**[0:18:29-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:29):**  is not just unsustainable ecologically and environmentally, but economically it's completely  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:38):**  unsustainable such that farmers will continue to remain in poverty because they barely have  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:44):**  enough crops to feed themselves.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:47):**  What Dr. Hands and the Inga alley cropping model offer is that alternative for people  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:51):**  to raise themselves out of poverty and farmers have had tremendous success selling their  
**[0:18:57-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:18:57):**  crops and increasing their role as stakeholders in the local economies.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:07):**  They're able to work with local vendors and local merchants to sell their cash crops and  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:13):**  then in turn they're able to put that back into the economy.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:20):**  I'm reminded of a farmer in Honduras, his name eludes me, but I can get you that if  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:28):**  you'd like.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:30):**  He was in abject poverty in Honduras to such a degree that he was about to immigrate into  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:39):**  the United States illegally just so that he could have a job, so that he could provide  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:44):**  for his family, so that he could send money back for his family.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:48):**  When Dr. Hands was telling me this story, it was heartbreaking what he was telling me,  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:53):**  but what happened is that one of his neighbors had implemented the Inga alley cropping model  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:19:59):**  and he had never heard of Inga alley cropping before.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:01):**  He was a subsistence farmer who had used slash and burn all his life, so his parents, he  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:07):**  had never known anything else, but his neighbor was telling him about all of these benefits,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:11):**  about you have crops year after year, you have enough corn to feed your family, you  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:15):**  have firewood, you have everything that you need, and then he was showing him all of his  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:18):**  wonderful cash crops that he was able to grow and sell and able to keep money for himself  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:22):**  and for his family.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:25):**  And sure enough, this farmer reached out to Dr. Hands and the Inga Foundation and they  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:31):**  helped establish alleys and now he's rowing and thriving and so is his family and they're  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:36):**  all doing incredibly well for themselves.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:38):**  Just one of the many success stories of Inga alley cropping.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:42):**  Yeah, that's a fantastic story and I've heard so many just like that.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:46):**  Much of where I was living in Guatemala, many of the subsistence farmers there were teetering  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:52):**  in between the option of staying and trying to make a living on increasingly infertile  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:20:56):**  land, especially in the rocky kind of mountainous region where we were, where there was risk  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:01):**  of erosion and those cycles of slash and burn were starting to completely deplete the few  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:07):**  resources left for agriculture and considering migrating up.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:11):**  And it made me think a lot that perhaps if we put half of the resources in the United  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:16):**  States going towards anti-immigration policies and trying to keep people from crossing the  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:21):**  border from the south, if we were to put those resources into programs like Inga alley cropping  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:28):**  and giving people better options from everyone who I spoke to down in that region, they would  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:34):**  much rather stay where they are, remain in their communities and be able to provide well  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:40):**  for their families and the people that they support.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:43):**  But because of those lack of options is why they're considering going up.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:47):**  And it just makes me think that, you know, redirecting some of those resources could  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:52):**  both problems and really increase the livelihoods of people in their own countries.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:56):**  One hundred percent agree, Oliver.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:21:58):**  And it's also because a lot of what you hear about climate change and carbon emissions  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:07):**  and carbon sequestration, slash and burn agriculture contributes more carbon to the atmosphere  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:13):**  than all global transport combined.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:16):**  So it's really about going for the big results with climate change is that if we can if we  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:21):**  can cut slash and burn, if we can stop slash and burn agriculture by providing people with  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:26):**  sustainable alternatives to it, then I think we have taken a tremendous step towards addressing  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:33):**  the problem of climate change.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:35):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:36):**  Now, let's talk about some of the details here that I just wasn't quite clear on through  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:40):**  the website.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:42):**  When you're creating these alley cropping models, are you following a contour line on  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:47):**  the slope of the site or does it has that not been tried out so much yet?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:53):**  It hasn't been tried out so much as far to my knowledge of following contour lines on  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:22:59):**  the slope.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:00):**  They're pretty much just planted in parallel hedgerows, whether that's horizontally or  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:10):**  vertically going up the mountain or going up or down the mountain is something that  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:15):**  I'm not completely familiar with.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:19):**  But I think that Dr. Hands is always experimenting with the model and trying new things to improve  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:26):**  it for the sake of the farmers themselves.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:31):**  And I remember kind of working with the communities where I was at in Guatemala and a lot of the  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:36):**  issues with trying to work into an agroforestry model is the amount of time that it takes  
**[0:23:43-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:43):**  for trees and sort of longer maturing shrubs or perennials to mature and trying to bridge  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:51):**  that gap in between how long it takes to get those systems established and start to have  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:23:57):**  a harvest from them and the money that is lost in the interim.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:01):**  And many times, especially in the context in which you're working, people don't have  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:05):**  that time in which they can stop making some sort of money because they're kind of walking  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:12):**  a razor's edge on insolvency to begin with.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:15):**  How do you bridge that gap in the time it takes for the systems to establish?  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:21):**  And that's one of the wonderful things about Inga Alley cropping is how quickly it takes  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:28):**  off.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:31):**  Most Inga Alley cropping systems are ready for that first stage, the pruning stage like  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:38):**  I was telling you about.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:39):**  They're ready for that after about a year to a year and a half.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:44):**  Inga trees reach their maturity at around two to three years.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:48):**  So it's good to prune them pretty frequently, not just so that the farmers have firewood  
**[0:24:54-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:24:54):**  and mulch, but also so that the trees can continue to contribute nitrogen to the soil  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:04):**  as well as protect farmers' crops.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:07):**  It's difficult to implement at first, like you were saying, with families walking that  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:15):**  razor's edge who are in the slash and burn models.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:20):**  But once it is implemented, it takes care of itself.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:26):**  We have people in Honduras who work with people who are just starting out and just implementing  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:31):**  the Inga Alley cropping model.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:34):**  We've got about 12 paid people in Honduras who work with the families and farmers who  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:43):**  are implementing the system.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:45):**  So we're constantly checking in on them to make sure that the system is being implemented  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:50):**  properly, to make sure that they're planting crops properly, and that it's essentially  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:56):**  it's a teaching model.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:57):**  It's a teaching system.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:25:59):**  So that after that two to three year threshold, families can do it for themselves.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:26:07):**  That in turn can lead to the spreading of the system from farmer to farmer.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:26:16):**  One of the ultimate goals of the Inga Foundation is to have the model become almost a farmer  
**[0:26:22-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:26:22):**  to farmer initiative, a grassroots model where the Inga Foundation trains, and we've currently  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:26:30):**  trained about 240, 250 families in the Inga Alley cropping model.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:26:37):**  We like to increase that number 10-hundred fold because the ultimate goal would be to  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:26:42):**  have the families teach each other to make it this self-replicating model that can be  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:26:48):**  spread across the tropics, not just in Honduras but in Guatemala, in Brazil.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:26:55):**  And the Inga Alley cropping model can even be replicated in other tropical nations across  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:03):**  the world, in Asia and as well as in Africa.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:07):**  There are species of the Inga tree and there are other nitrogen fixing species that Dr.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:14):**  Hans has done intensive research on that would work in similar agroforestry alley cropping  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:22):**  models.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:23):**  Now that's perfect because I was just about to ask where else have you worked or tried  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:29):**  out some projects aside from just Honduras?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:35):**  And just as a follow up to that question, Dr. Hans who's done nearly, so it's been over  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:43):**  25 years of research into Inga Alley cropping and into slash and burn agriculture, he started  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:50):**  out actually as an engineer, but once he saw the devastation that alley cropping was causing  
**[0:27:58-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:27:58):**  he knew that it was his calling to make these people's lives better and to bring them some  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:05):**  hope.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:07):**  So that's exactly what he did.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:09):**  He dedicated his time and his energy to researching alternatives for these people.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:15):**  And he partnered with the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew with whom he still has a working  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:21):**  relationship.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:22):**  He's done a lot of research with them.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:25):**  He even established a rainforest.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:26):**  He helped to establish a rainforest biome there in which he's bringing awareness to  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:35):**  people in England about what is the rainforest and why do we need to save it?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:41):**  Why does it matter?  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:42):**  And why can we not allow or why do we have to provide an alternative to slash and burn  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:46):**  agriculture?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:48):**  And that's really where he's done a lot of his research.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:51):**  Although in Honduras it's proven.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:28:55):**  He's proven it with the families that are implementing the system successfully and on  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:01):**  their own.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:03):**  And he could do it in tropical nations around the world.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:07):**  There have been a number of testing and demo farms in Honduras.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:18):**  And there have even been other nations.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:22):**  Basically we're talking about groups of farmers from other nations who have come to  
**[0:29:30-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:30):**  Honduras and seen the work that he's doing there.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:37):**  And they've taken back Inga trees to their respective nations.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:44):**  And they have even taken back some of the education that they were given.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:51):**  It was back in 2015 that Dr. Hands hosted a number of people from various Central American  
**[0:29:57-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:29:57):**  nations and really they worked hands on with Dr. Hands and the Hanveran staff to go over  
**[0:30:05-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:05):**  every step of the process of implementing Inga alleys in their respective countries.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:13):**  And they were from all over from what he told me.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:17):**  They were from places like Guatemala, Brazil, Honduras, you name it.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:21):**  They came from all over.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:22):**  I think it was at least 13 of them.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:24):**  It was at least 13 of them from all over who wanted to implement Inga alley cropping in  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:29):**  their respective countries.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:31):**  Now just curious, what is the range of hardiness zones where the Inga can survive?  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:37):**  Just to give me an idea of like how far this could spread latitude.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:42):**  As far as specific lines of latitude and longitude, I don't know if I can provide those.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:49):**  But the Inga edulis tree, which is native to South America, it can spread all over South  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:30:57):**  America for sure.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:02):**  But there are analog species because the Inga edulis is just one of many species of Inga  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:08):**  trees.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:10):**  There are other species of Inga trees, some of which have nitrogen fixing properties that  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:14):**  could work in other nations across the world.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:19):**  But there are also analog species of nitrogen fixing trees that Dr. Hans has done research  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:24):**  with that work in other nations in Africa as well as in Asia.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:30):**  Now from another environmental perspective here, is there a risk of the Inga becoming  
**[0:31:34-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:34):**  an invasive species and taking over and causing havoc in native or otherwise established ecosystems  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:41):**  where it's being implemented?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:43):**  As far as implementing Inga trees in monocultures, Dr. Hans has had no problem implementing Inga  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:52):**  trees in monocultures and them in turn becoming invasive.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:31:57):**  It's partly due because of the families who sustain the model, who sustain the system.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:05):**  The families who depend upon the Inga alleys keep the Inga alleys in check.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:10):**  Inga trees grow quickly.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:12):**  That's one of the advantageous things about the Inga tree.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:18):**  But no threat has yet to come of Inga trees planted in these monocultures forming an invasive  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:27):**  species.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:29):**  They are a tree that grow naturally in the rainforest and there are massive Inga trees  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:37):**  that Dr. Hans has reported finding down in Honduras.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:41):**  Some of them 100 years old, old, old Inga trees just in the middle of the forest.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:49):**  So they're right at home in the rainforest.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:54):**  But the Inga tree does do a really good job, one thing it does a great job of is keeping  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:32:59):**  out invasive trees.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:02):**  It does keep out invasive species of weeds and plants such that farmers don't need to  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:09):**  worry about growing their crops and their crops being choked out by weeds.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:15):**  They're able to plant their crops and grow them in as close to a forest floor as can  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:21):**  be simulated by an Inga model.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:25):**  And now what does this do for the biodiversity of the regions affected?  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:28):**  Now obviously where you're going to implement this and where the trees are being planted,  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:35):**  the land has already been basically stripped bare by the fires, right?  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:39):**  And establishing any kind of perennial system is going to help the biodiversity in some  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:45):**  way.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:46):**  Are there any other incentives to plant or cultivate the native species that were removed  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:54):**  in the first place or does it have the potential to bring back some of the birds and the fauna  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:33:59):**  that are needed in the new habitat?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:02):**  Yes indeed.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:03):**  I mean the Inga model not only allows for some of the local flora and fauna to return  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:12):**  because it's now able to.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:14):**  It can survive because it's not being scorched by the sun in these humid and tropical ecosystems.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:23):**  So the biodiversity, both the flora and the fauna, can return.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:29):**  As far as biodiversity of other trees, the Inga Foundation does have a nursery.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:37):**  Not only has a large nursery, but actually it's three nurseries.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:43):**  We recently built one in which they can germinate upwards of 100, 200,000 trees.  
**[0:34:51-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:34:51):**  Not just Inga trees, but it's also about other native species of trees in which the Inga  
**[0:35:02-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:02):**  Foundation eventually does hope to, once the model has proven it, once the model has regenerated  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:11):**  the soil to a degree where trees can be planted, if farmers would like to plant hardwoods,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:20):**  they're more than welcome to do so.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:23):**  As long as the Inga trees that are there have regenerated the soil enough to a degree that  
**[0:35:33-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:33):**  they're able to plant hardwoods to bring back that biodiversity with the trees so that we  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:42):**  can really bring back the rainforest.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:45):**  Now from the perspective of the cultivators, of the farmers who are implementing this,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:52):**  is there any, like I can imagine some of the hesitation being that space is now given up  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:35:57):**  on the land that could otherwise be occupied by more profitable plants?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:04):**  And I know some of the other sticking points that people have been wary of is that these  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:10):**  intercroppings of trees could shade out the crops that they're trying to grow.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:15):**  How do you help to convince the people who are considering implementing this method that  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:21):**  planting trees is actually within the interest of whatever crop that they're trying to gain  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:26):**  in income from?  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:28):**  Great question.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:32):**  So with the farmers who are concerned about profit, the Inga Foundation has a demo farm  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:42):**  in which they're able to educate farmers who come to visit.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:49):**  That was actually how the Inga Foundation and the Land for Life project was started  
**[0:36:54-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:36:54):**  in 2012, where about a dozen families who had visited the demonstration farm in Las  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:01):**  Flores, they decided that they were going to sign up.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:06):**  They decided they were going to sign up for the Inga alley cropping model.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:09):**  So that's the first step of convincing a family or farmers who want to implement an Inga alley  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:19):**  cropping model but are concerned about profit is namely through education.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:25):**  Education is, as a teacher, I know the value of an education and how sometimes someone  
**[0:37:33-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:33):**  can have such a deep-seated notion or an idea in their head that frankly it might be a little  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:41):**  flawed.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:43):**  But it's your job as a teacher not just to say that it's flawed but to give someone a  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:50):**  new way of thinking, a better way of thinking, or to approach a problem from a different  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:37:54):**  perspective in which you've learned something and you're better as a result of it.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:01):**  So for families who are concerned solely about profit, they make more profit using the Inga  
**[0:38:08-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:08):**  alley cropping model than simply by having fields of slash and burned land on which they  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:17):**  grow a few crops for a few years.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:20):**  It's a question of would you rather, it's a question of would you rather, it's of a  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:24):**  short term, of short term profit or long term profit.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:28):**  So really with a profit, it's all about convincing families of the long term solution and how  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:35):**  in the long term you're going to make a lot more money implementing Inga alley cropping  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:39):**  as opposed to slash and burn.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:43):**  As far as shading, as far as the Inga trees shading out other crops, the shade is necessary  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:55):**  in the Inga alley cropping model.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:38:57):**  The shade and the mulch are two incredibly important pieces.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:01):**  The only outside fertilizer that Dr. Hands uses in the Inga alley cropping model is rock  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:08):**  phosphate, which is a relatively cheap and abundant fertilizer.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:13):**  He gets it from Florida.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:14):**  He gets it by the metric ton.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:16):**  So when I was going over his budgets one day, I'm like, Dr. Hands, why do you have a line  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:22):**  item for like six tons of rock phosphate?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:25):**  He's like, oh, we need it.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:26):**  I was like, all right, I'm not gonna ask any questions.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:32):**  So the shade is important because it shades out the sun.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:38):**  The sun is incredibly harsh in these tropical regions.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:42):**  So it's important that the crops are protected, at least while they're germinating and while  
**[0:39:50-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:50):**  they're still young, so that they're not burnt to a crisp.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:39:58):**  And then the mulch, of course, nourishes them.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:00):**  The rock phosphate is the fertilizer, also nourishes them.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:04):**  The nitrogen fixing trees nourishes the crops.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:07):**  So that by the time that the crops are ready to, the farmers are ready to get a crop that  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:15):**  they're trying to harvest, you've got incredibly strong plants.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:21):**  You've got, I mean, just looking at some of the images that Dr. Hands has sent me, he's  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:25):**  got some of the biggest pineapples I've ever seen in my life.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:29):**  They're just massive.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:31):**  And these cash crops are as large as they are simply because they've been nourished  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:38):**  by an Inga Alley cropping model, not just from the beginning stages, but all the way  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:44):**  through the process.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:46):**  And as far as generating interest, as far as how we generate interest in the model for  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:53):**  the farmers, again, it returns to education.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:40:58):**  In the long-term goal of the Inga Foundation is to actually establish an educational center  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:06):**  where the foundation can showcase success stories, like the one I was telling you about,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:13):**  and to host delegations from all over the world, from tropical regions all over the  
**[0:41:18-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:18):**  world, as well as to send people back with not only Inga trees, but also with analogous  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:28):**  species to prove that this model cannot just work, that it works in Honduras, can work  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:33):**  elsewhere.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:37):**  Because what I see time and time again with environmental organizations is that you see  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:47):**  people saying, oh, we just need to plant trees.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:49):**  We just need to keep planting trees and keep planting trees and keep planting trees.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:53):**  And although reforestation is excellent, I'm a big fan of reforestation.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:41:58):**  I grew up on a tree farm, actually.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:03):**  And I understand the value of it.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:05):**  The problem is that unless you have a model in place whereby the trees that you plant  
**[0:42:12-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:12):**  can be tended to and taken care of, and someone is there the whole way making sure that they're  
**[0:42:22-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:22):**  not dying and that they're being watered, et cetera, you're not creating a sustainable  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:28):**  model.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:29):**  And really, with the environmental crisis that we're facing as a world today, we need  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:34):**  something, we need a model that is sustainable for everybody.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:38):**  And that's what we believe that the Inga Alley cropping model can provide.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:46):**  I agree with what you're saying, not just from the economic standpoint and the ability  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:42:53):**  to kind of help to recuperate from what seems like an antiquated system, but these days,  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:00):**  it seems more urgent than ever.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:01):**  I mean, we're coming at a time within the last couple of weeks where huge, huge fires  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:07):**  have been set in the Amazon rainforest, just further south from where a lot of your demonstration  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:12):**  sites are.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:13):**  And most of this is motivated through an investment in agricultural model, especially towards  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:22):**  producing cattle and producing soy.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:25):**  Obviously, there is the potential to grow and to reap so, so much more from a more diverse  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:32):**  ecosystem, but I'm seeing a lot of potential application for this type of model in the  
**[0:43:38-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:38):**  immediate recuperation of the viability of these damaged ecosystems coming off of such  
**[0:43:45-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:45):**  major destruction.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:47):**  Where do you see this potentially going and generating interest, especially as this is  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:52):**  an increasingly hot-button issue?  
**[0:43:54-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:43:54):**  Well, where we see this generating interest most is, well, ideally worldwide.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:44:07):**  The Inga Foundation would like to see the model replicated in the tropics worldwide.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:44:14):**  The investment, like you said, is a huge issue.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:44:20):**  The Inga Foundation is a lean organization.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:44:26):**  We've helped about 250, 260 farmers so far since 2012.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:44:34):**  But eventually, the hope is, like I said, to make the Inga Alley cropping model that  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:44:42):**  self-replicating model for farmers so that they are taking that initiative and they're  
**[0:44:48-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:44:48):**  spreading the word without the need for outside investment.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:44:55):**  Right now, however, at this stage where an immediate solution and a viable solution is  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:01):**  needed, investment is necessary.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:03):**  The problem that's faced is, like you said, where so much of the investment is going to  
**[0:45:11-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:11):**  factory farms for cattle or these massive plots of land for soy.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:17):**  It's difficult to get that investment.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:20):**  So the ultimate goal of the Inga Foundation right now is to spread awareness, to show  
**[0:45:28-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:28):**  people that this is the solution, that if you're going to invest in a nonprofit, if  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:39):**  you're going to invest in a nonprofit to save the rainforest, that this is the one.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:44):**  With that said, how can our listeners get in touch with you and the organization and  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:49):**  reach out to either donate or get involved more actively?  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:54):**  Excellent.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:55):**  Great.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:56):**  Thank you so much for that question.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:45:57):**  And the best way to get in touch with the organization is to first go to our website,  
**[0:46:05-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:05):**  which is www.ingatree.org.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:13):**  Another great way to reach out to us is to drop us a line on Gmail.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:18):**  Our email is ingatrees at gmail.com.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:23):**  Both of those are great ways to reach out to us, to donate to us, to just contact us  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:28):**  because we've got a lot of really good information on our website.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:32):**  You can find a lot of materials that we have there.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:36):**  We've got a number of videos that show why the Inga Allicraft model is so revolutionary  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:44):**  and such a breakthrough to save the world's rainforests.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:48):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:49):**  James, thank you so much for taking the time to explain this system to me a lot better.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:46:55):**  I learned a lot from the website itself, but to kind of have these questions answered in  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:02):**  a sequential manner and kind of spelled out not only with the information, but also with  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:08):**  the stories behind it and the people that it affects was really, really important for  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:12):**  me.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:13):**  So again, thanks for taking the time.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:14):**  I really urge people, especially in these times of such destruction in our natural resources,  
**[0:47:20-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:20):**  the rainforest especially, to reach out and see what you can do and look into alternatives  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:24):**  such as the Inga Alley cropping model.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:27):**  And hopefully we can do a follow up as this continues to grow and hopefully continue to  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:31):**  gain traction down the line.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:33):**  Sure thing.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:34):**  I really like the opportunity to talk to you again to give you updates on the incredible  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:40):**  work that we're doing.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:41):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:42):**  Well again, thanks so much for taking time.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:43):**  You have a great rest of your day and we'll be in touch.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:46):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:47):**  All right, that wraps things up for this week's episode.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:47:51):**  If you enjoyed this interview and want to find more like it, as well as articles and

**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:11):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:15):**  natural materials, to beekeeping, vermicompost, permaculture design, philosophy, and so much  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:20):**  more.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:22):**  Thank you so much to those of you who've taken the time to reach out via comments and emails.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:26):**  Your contributions helped me to make this the conversation that it's intended to be  
**[0:48:30-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:30):**  and helps me create more of the content around the topics that you're interested in.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:35):**  If you have any insights, advice, questions, or suggestions, be sure to send them to me  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:39):**  at info at abundantedge.com and I'll look forward to being in touch.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-james-potter/#t=0:48:43):**  New episodes come out every Friday like clockwork, so I'll catch you on next week's show.

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 05 Jul 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:59-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright everybody, before I get started with today's episode, I wanted to let you know  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:07):**  about a new project that I've just launched.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:10):**  After years of highlighting and promoting the knowledge, wisdom, and projects of innovators  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:14):**  and leaders in regenerative living through this podcast, I've realized that this audio  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:18):**  format can only ever reach so many people.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:21):**  There are so many others out there who engage more with other forms of learning.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:25):**  That's why I've started the Abundant Edge YouTube channel.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:28):**  Now that I'm back on the road and visiting regenerative and sustainable projects in my  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:32):**  travels, I'll be profiling the people and organizations that are making a real impact  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:36):**  on their environments and their communities.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:39):**  My goal is to show as many people as I can reach that you don't have to have a lot  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:42):**  of money, access to a ton of resources, or have a fancy education under your belt to  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:47):**  make a real difference in this world and create change.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:50):**  My first mini-documentary highlights the unbelievable achievements of a small community called Kishaya  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:55):**  in the highlands of Guatemala.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:58):**  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:01):**  owner who kept the ecosystem under monoculture cultivation and exploited the local people  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:06):**  who worked for slave wages on the farm.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:09):**  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:13):**  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:16):**  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:21):**  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:25):**  it and create a better life for their families.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:28):**  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:32):**  a profound abundance which you'll see in the documentary.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:36):**  Now if you want to see the rest, you'll have to check it out for yourself.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:38):**  You can find it really easily just by typing in abundant edge into the YouTube search bar,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:43):**  and be sure to keep an eye out for more short films highlighting the projects that I visit  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:47):**  as I travel through Mexico and beyond.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:49):**  I'll also be releasing tutorials on everything from design theory to building and gardening  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:53):**  techniques in the upcoming months.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:55):**  I really hope that this will become a resource that, like the podcast, helps to inspire you  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:00):**  to live your highest potential by living regeneratively.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:05):**  As I continue to explore the myriad options that exist for profitable regenerative work,  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:09):**  I keep coming back to the business aspects of impact and integrity entrepreneurship.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:14):**  Now one of the people that I've come to rely on for professional perspectives in this sphere  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:18):**  is Pete Wyden, founder of the Epic EcoDesigner.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:22):**  And I had the chance to catch up with him for today's session where we explore many  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:25):**  aspects of the personal and external challenges of finding holistic success in an ecological  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:31):**  business.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:32):**  Now in this interview with Pete, we break down some of the challenges that we both faced  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:36):**  in getting our design and consulting businesses off the ground, and some of the most important  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:40):**  takeaways that we learned from.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:42):**  Pete talks about the common challenges that he sees from the people that he coaches, and  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:45):**  stresses the importance of doing the inner work to understand how you want to grow.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:50):**  He also shares some tips on marketing strategies to help attract your ideal clients and reach  
**[0:03:55-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:55):**  a larger audience.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:56):**  Now as we'll repeat a few times in this session, a lot of Pete's advice applies to any business  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:01):**  type and not just ecological designers and consultants.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:04):**  So I'm sure nearly all of you will get some value out of this one.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:08):**  So now I'll turn things over to Pete.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:11):**  Hey Pete, it's such a pleasure to be talking to you again.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:13):**  How are you doing buddy?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:14):**  I am doing so great Oliver.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:16):**  It is almost July here in Minnesota.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:20):**  Just had an excellent design meeting with some nearby clients and loving life.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:25):**  Great to be here.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:26):**  You and I have been in touch through a lot of the different transitions that I've had  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:30):**  between Guatemala and here, and I'm actually going to be coming out to Minnesota pretty  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:34):**  soon and we're going to get picked up in person.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:36):**  Yes, I am stoked.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:38):**  A friend of mine is giving me a canoe very soon too, so I'll probably get out on the  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:42):**  water.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:43):**  Get on the lakes, yeah for sure.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:45):**  Now I know you've had a whole bunch of things going on, not the least of which developing  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:49):**  a project with your band, working with the Epic Eco Designer program, with other ecological  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:55):**  designers in your area, and even some of your own design clients.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:00):**  So what are we today?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:01):**  Just get into the questions since we did a previous interview, it was more than a year  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:06):**  ago now, and if anybody's interested in learning about your personal background, I'll put a  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:10):**  link to that episode in the show notes on this and they can find out about how you got  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:14):**  started and what you do.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:15):**  Perfect.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:16):**  Alright cool, so let's start to explore a little bit about what you've seen in the potential  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:22):**  for environmental regenerative work to be lucrative, how people can form businesses  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:28):**  around this.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:29):**  What have you seen for yourself in this regard?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:31):**  Well it was interesting, and I won't get too much into my backstory, but shortening that  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:38):**  up, I had a lot of experiences working in other people's businesses and in my own, where  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:44):**  I just felt so short-handed in terms of understanding how to really see myself as the true expert  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:52):**  and specialist that I am.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:54):**  As an ecological designer, I personally have a background in ecology and landscape architecture,  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:59):**  and I've been focusing on residential design and now moving more into agricultural, larger  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:05):**  scale educational centers, retreat centers, things like that in the Midwest here.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:10):**  But for so long, I kept myself from diving into my own business and I just kept helping  
**[0:06:17-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:17):**  people with theirs because I was feeling absolutely lost as far as how to find potential clients  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:25):**  who really wanted this type of work, this specialized type of design, how to have a  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:31):**  conversation and feel natural about money with them, and also getting out of this feeling  
**[0:06:39-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:39):**  that I had to somehow undercut my prices in order to be appealing just for someone to  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:48):**  hire me.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:50):**  And so how does that fly in the face of some of the things that you've learned since then  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:54):**  that have helped to build your confidence and helped you also to build the confidence  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:58):**  of other people you've worked with into the realities of what the potential is when you  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:02):**  kind of either break off on your own or realize the power that you have within this knowledge  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:08):**  base?  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:09):**  Yeah, and there's a couple sides to that.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:11):**  The first one that is a little bit harder to put a pin in is this aspect of self-worth.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:22):**  And it's definitely contextual as far as our individual way that that manifests.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:27):**  But so many people, just in general, designer or not, we have this kind of skewed view of  
**[0:07:35-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:35):**  ourselves in terms of the true value, true worth of just us as people in general, but  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:43):**  realizing that we don't have to be something external from ourselves.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:48):**  And we can be authentic and relaxed and really be in our own flow and be making a great living  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:55):**  as a designer.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:57):**  And another, so it's like, we don't have to somehow extend ourselves beyond who we truly  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:03):**  are.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:04):**  We can become some weird idea of the all powerful Oliver in order to be this designer with the  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:13):**  lucrative business who's doing really valuable work.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:16):**  Sure, it's that jumping past self-doubt and into becoming an egomaniac.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:21):**  There's a better balance in there.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:23):**  Tell me how this realization has helped you in your own life and your own business.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:28):**  One aspect of it, which is the other piece that I had mentioned, I alluded to, is that  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:34):**  this work, there's so much benefit to what we do for people, for the planet and the results  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:42):**  that we can get people with a permaculture, ecological hybrid approach, whatever your  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:48):**  specific approach is, is we're all so unique.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:52):**  It's so pragmatic, it's so functional and it can be beautiful as well, of course.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:58):**  So I actually found that it's easier to sell that type of work because of the added benefit  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:03):**  and it's because of the depth of value there.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:06):**  And really, I was thinking about it on my drive to this design meeting today.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:13):**  Even I have done hundreds of these meetings.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:15):**  Sometimes I still get nervous before them.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:17):**  It's natural.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:19):**  But at the same time, that's really just because I care and I want to make sure that the client  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:24):**  feels supported.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:27):**  I have this client-centric perspective on my business, which is so important.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:32):**  And that really takes a lot of the issues of self-worth out because the issues of, do  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:38):**  I know enough, am I good enough, etc., it's like none of that really matters when you're  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:45):**  looking at it from a perspective of how can I help this person and that you are a guide  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:51):**  who sees possibility and potential and acts upon that rather than having to be some kind  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:56):**  of walking encyclopedia.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:58):**  Because a walking encyclopedia actually throws people off in my experience rather than them  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:05):**  trusting you because they're like, oh, that person knows everything.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:08):**  It's not a natural state to be in as a human, as an organism.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:17):**  Infectious curiosity is really what wins the day at all times in a sales conversation,  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:21):**  in a design meeting, or whatever.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:23):**  So that really solved the self-worth piece for me.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:28):**  And as far as value-based pricing, which is what I teach people that I work with on their  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:33):**  business, a lot of that has to do with our sense of self-worth as a designer, but as  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:38):**  a person in the rest of our lives, too, because the business is only a third of who we are.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:43):**  We have our relationships to ourself, our relationship to others in our personal life  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:48):**  as well.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:49):**  So really all of that is affected by our sense of self-worth.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:53):**  And so one of the things that I've always found that you've been uniquely good at is  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:56):**  communicating this sort of added value of the services of ecological design over conventional  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:03):**  landscaping and things like that.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:05):**  Tell me a little bit about how you convey that message to people to help them to understand  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:11):**  all of the benefits that sort of a holistic approach to their natural systems can bring  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:17):**  and how it's sort of related to finding clients.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:21):**  OK.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:22):**  So I'll just give you a couple layers there.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:24):**  So as far as finding clients, that one is definitely specific to each business.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:34):**  It relates to how best we communicate with others, what types of settings we like to  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:41):**  be in, what our real clientele focus is.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:44):**  For example, if you're focusing on consulting with farmers on soil health or if you're working  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:49):**  on getting residential clients, you're going to be in different settings and interacting  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:52):**  with people in different ways.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:55):**  Ultimately, regardless of who you're working with when it comes to lead generation, creating  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:01):**  relationships with people, sales, it's really just about understanding what their top of  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:07):**  mind problem is.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:08):**  And that's such a ubiquitous recommendation in any industry, any business, but because  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:16):**  it's true.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:18):**  And so as part of that client-centric approach, it's really about being just inquisitive and  
**[0:12:25-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:25):**  by nature of being an ecological designer, farmer, whatever we may be doing that we're  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:34):**  using our experience to be consulting for others and help them shorten the gap between  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:41):**  where they're at and where they want to be.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:43):**  It's really understanding not only where they want to be, because that's pretty easy for  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:48):**  people to talk about.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:50):**  What's the vision?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:51):**  Of course, some people don't have a vision and are looking to a consultant to help them  
**[0:12:55-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:55):**  there, but it's really about understanding where that person is today and why they're  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:03):**  there, what the inner workings are of their life, their mind, their relationship to their  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:10):**  property in this example, that's going to help us really understand what the value would  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:15):**  be if we were to help them address those issues from our perspective and from that bird's  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:21):**  eye perspective on their situation.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:23):**  Well, talk to me a little bit about how you get in that deep with a client or someone  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:27):**  that you're collaborating with to sort of suss out these things that many of us either  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:33):**  don't know how to talk about or are unaware of about the things that are holding us back,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:39):**  the problems that are more at the or below the surface that are perhaps causing the problems  
**[0:13:46-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:46):**  with the hang ups or any of those other issues for what it is we say that we're trying to  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:54):**  achieve.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:56):**  And you made a really good observation there.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:59):**  Below the surface is key because in so much of life, I just had a very short conversation  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:05):**  with my neighbor and I was like, it made me a little bit restless and it was a really  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:11):**  good nice little exchange, but I was just like, hey, how's it going?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:16):**  And they're like, hey, good, you.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:18):**  And then we talked about the weather and it's like, that's nice to make that connection,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:21):**  but it's so surface level and I was the instigator of that.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:28):**  Getting below the surface with people is not something we commonly do, especially with  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:33):**  people we've just met, but it is the one thing that's going to build trust most quickly with  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:41):**  somebody.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:42):**  One, because you're breaking through that initial barrier that so many people feel they  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:49):**  need to uphold around strangers or in public or whatnot, people don't actually want to  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:56):**  be that way.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:57):**  They want connection.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:58):**  And in order to make that comfortable for people, they really have to know that you're  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:03):**  looking out for their best interests.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:05):**  And showing somebody that you are looking out for their best interests is about being  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:11):**  inquisitive rather than being the person who's telling, telling, telling, telling, telling,  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:16):**  telling, telling.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:17):**  Like I get sold to all the time where people are like telling me, oh, this will be good  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:21):**  for your business or whatever.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:25):**  If they're coming at me from the perspective of telling me everything they can do, I know  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:30):**  that right off the bat, it's not going to be something I'm interested in at all.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:34):**  And I think honestly, that's where a lot of consultants lose potential sales, is that  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:40):**  the person on the other end of that conversation, the person receiving your spiel or whatever  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:46):**  you're doing, they may not think about it consciously unless they're in sales and they  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:52):**  understand these nuanced differences to interacting with people.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:56):**  But if you come at it from a point of wanting to understand and in that sense, digging deeper  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:03):**  into the things they're talking about, finding clarity.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:08):**  Because someone could say, oh, well, I'm having a lot of issues with my yard.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:12):**  There's like really bad drainage and other stuff going on.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:17):**  You know, some consultants might just write down, oh, poor drainage, we need to fix that.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:23):**  What's that causing?  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:24):**  What's that causing in their landscape?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:25):**  What kind of issues is it causing in the rest of their life?  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:29):**  Do they want to have outdoor barbecues and they can't because it's too muddy to put chairs  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:35):**  out?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:36):**  It's these very specific contextual aspects of how someone's current situation is affecting  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:42):**  them that results in being able to communicate the value of you stepping in and helping them  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:47):**  out.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:48):**  Now, I find in my own interactions with clients like this, usually asking why a few times  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:54):**  will get down into sort of the more base level of what it is that's either causing the issue  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:01):**  or is the thing that they're wanting to achieve but are finding friction or blockages in the  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:07):**  way of.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:08):**  But also coming at it from a perspective of offering up a little bit of personal vulnerability  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:14):**  or finding a way to relate whether you've had the same experience or just a similar  
**[0:17:19-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:19):**  one or no one who has often gets them to explain or I guess sort of communicate the parts that  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:29):**  they weren't planning on, but that are key to understanding what the real objective in  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:34):**  any project is.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:36):**  Have you got methods or maybe even design criteria or communication steps to sort of,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:43):**  I don't want to say fast track that because it's not always a race for time, but to sort  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:47):**  of systematize it so that it doesn't get overlooked.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:53):**  Well I think a big part of that is it's just going through these conversations with people.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:59):**  So there's a few different aspects, I mean just so many things that we're talking about.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:04):**  But one of these pieces is that it takes experience and running through these conversations.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:12):**  So like I said I've worked with hundreds of design clients and so I can sense when there's  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:18):**  something more that we could be talking about when I feel like there's not true stone at  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:24):**  the bottom of the well clarity on what's really happening for them.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:30):**  As far as systematizing it, I think part of what you may be getting at is do I have some  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:37):**  type of rubric I use to go through things with my clients.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:42):**  As part of the United Designers family of professionals, I do take some of that lead  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:50):**  that Dan Halsey and others have put into Rubik for Understanding where someone's at and making  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:57):**  sure I'm covering different angles.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:59):**  But at the same time I find that every client is so different that I at this point use my  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:06):**  experience to guide me in terms of what I really need to know to make sure I'm putting  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:12):**  together a proposal that's going to really convey that value to somebody and get them  
**[0:19:17-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:17):**  really excited from a piece of paper about a design and a transformation in real life  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:25):**  in their property.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:27):**  So as far as creating a system around it, it's good to have an idea of the certain topics  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:36):**  you want to cover with somebody.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:38):**  But as far as getting to the bottom of something, a huge piece for me was getting comfortable  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:44):**  asking somebody why.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:47):**  I've never had somebody look at me and be like, no, I don't want to talk about that.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:52):**  Why are you keep asking why?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:53):**  Are you four years old?  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:55):**  And you don't have to just say why, why, why, because that would be ridiculous, right?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:59):**  But if somebody says, well, I really wish we want to put a new patio in, but I don't  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:07):**  want to have it over here, I want to have it over there, rather than just investing  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:15):**  in that level of the story and saying, okay, we'll put it over there.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:19):**  How am I helping?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:21):**  Like yeah, maybe I might help by choosing materials in the shape or whatnot.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:25):**  But where people really see the value in having you around as a consultant in any situation  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:32):**  is when you are asking those mirroring questions that just keep bouncing that same topic, deeper  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:39):**  and deeper, it's like paddle ball and you're just getting farther and farther down that  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:42):**  little canyon.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:45):**  And then you can explore, you can get to the level of information that might tell you,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:52):**  well actually, well if you bring through lumber every so often to work on your furniture shop,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:59):**  well maybe the patio shouldn't be there or whatever.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:01):**  And they're like, oh wow, I didn't even think about that.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:04):**  And it's about getting that information so that you can have that bird's eye perspective  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:11):**  and give them the real evidence of the fact that you're thinking about things in a different  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:17):**  way.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:19):**  Because that's the only thing that ever ultimately sells a design, a consulting package of any  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:26):**  kind is, are you thinking in a different way from the client?  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:30):**  Because just like Einstein said, like we always quote, a problem can't be solved at the same  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:37):**  level of consciousness that created it.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:40):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:41):**  And so let's take a little shift right now away from just working directly with the clients  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:47):**  and start maybe a little bit further back from the beginning about how you project a  
**[0:21:52-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:52):**  message and start to add value to a conversation that would bring people to your services above  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:00):**  say a competitor or someone else in a similar field.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:06):**  So what I work on with one-to-one clients that I help in their business, we're focused  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:12):**  on four things.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:14):**  It's packaging their service, pricing it from a value perspective, marketing it and selling  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:20):**  it.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:21):**  And in order to have a productive conversation or even know if someone is right for your  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:28):**  service, you have to have that package clearly defined.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:33):**  So that I think is what exactly you offer.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:36):**  You jump further on that is whether the client is right for the services that you, and again,  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:41):**  this is one of the things that I've really gravitated towards in your message is you  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:46):**  also need to be screening the people who come to you.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:49):**  And I mean, it can be very difficult to do, especially in the beginning of starting a  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:55):**  business when you're still in a mindset of scarcity, thinking that you need to take every  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:01):**  single penny of business that comes your way.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:06):**  But how do you get out of that mentality of thinking, okay, anything is going to be worth  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:12):**  it.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:13):**  And realizing that there's only a handful of clients that are really going to compensate  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:18):**  you properly for your time and give you the types of projects that you are uniquely suited  
**[0:23:22-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:22):**  to do well at, and even continue to grow the experience that you want to build towards  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:29):**  the consultancy or the design firm that you ultimately want.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:35):**  And I want to start off by saying, I laugh about it now.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:41):**  But when I was just starting, I was so mired in that scarcity mindset and that energy.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:47):**  Oh, so was I. Yeah, I can totally relate.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:51):**  So with anyone who's just starting out, I feel that I've been there.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:54):**  With anyone who's farther along in their business, there are different aspects to feeling like  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:01):**  one is caught in a rut or whatever that are kind of warning flags that say, okay, let's  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:06):**  take another look at this and analyze it with a fresh perspective.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:12):**  But as far as this idea that one needs to take on whatever comes their way, that's just  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:19):**  a symptom.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:21):**  It's not a necessity.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:23):**  It's not a way of being that it's going to bring success or sustained growth.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:28):**  For example, if somebody is taking on a lot of jobs that they don't like, they might stop  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:32):**  reaching out to new leads and making sales and then the business slows down and they  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:36):**  end up quitting or whatever.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:38):**  Or they may not be able to take the leads that they really want because they're overcommitted  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:43):**  to ones that are simply draining their time and resources.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:46):**  Right.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:47):**  And I say that as a hypothetical as if that wasn't exactly what I went through.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:51):**  A friend of mine.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:53):**  Yeah, so having that package clearly defined, it's really the package results in a clear  
**[0:25:02-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:02):**  offer of what exactly you do for somebody and what that entails and how each part of  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:10):**  that package that you offer solves specific problems that they have.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:16):**  Because this is the client centric approach.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:19):**  It's not all about us.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:20):**  Every mindset comes from this warped perspective.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:24):**  Unfortunately, it's so prevalent and we all deal with it in various ways.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:30):**  It's kind of like, I don't want to say it's like fear where it's always around.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:36):**  It just gets quieter.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:37):**  But it's very pervasive in modern culture.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:39):**  And it's a big reason why so many people in the permaculture ecological design or other  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:47):**  world changer, world healer modalities are really fed up with the idea of money.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:54):**  It's something I come across all the time and it keeps us from being successful in this  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:00):**  current economy and really making the change that we want to see happen and really soaring.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:07):**  But as far as getting to a place where you're interacting with the people, at least on the  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:19):**  actual sales conversation level, once you get to that point with somebody, you know  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:24):**  that they're the right kind of person you want to work with before you even get to that  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:28):**  site visit or get on a call with them.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:30):**  You know that they're going to be a good fit if certain criteria are in place.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:37):**  They're really serious about making the results happen now.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:42):**  They're ready and willing to invest in what it takes to hire you as a consultant.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:48):**  But like I said, those symptoms of feeling frenzied and that just any job would do right  
**[0:26:56-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:56):**  now, it doesn't take that long to sit down and look at, okay, what am I really offering  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:05):**  here?  
**[0:27:08-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:08):**  And then be able to shift your energy, shift your perspective to one of excitement for  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:15):**  the people that you're going to help with this.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:18):**  The biggest piece and I would say 90% of my personal work on my business is simply emotional,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:27):**  the self-worth, the ability to be radically honest with myself and say, this isn't working.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:36):**  So instead of frantically wasting time on Facebook or some weird flyer that someone's  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:43):**  trying to sell me for marketing, I'm going to take two hours or whatever today.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:50):**  Maybe I'll take five hours and go for an amazing hike, get in a really great place of mind.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:57):**  And then spend a couple hours really taking an honest look, maybe with a friend, maybe  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:01):**  with a mentor or whatever on what am I really doing here?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:06):**  Because if you're moving forward from a place where there isn't that clarity, it's just  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:12):**  a recipe for unnecessary failure.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:17):**  And I mean, so much of what you've talked about is figuring out how to define not only  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:21):**  what your services are, but what it is that you're good at before creating this message  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:26):**  and doing all of this client outreach or marketing or whatever it might be to try and grow your  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:31):**  business.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:32):**  Because if those things are poorly defined, your message isn't going to ring true.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:35):**  Your marketing strategy isn't going to resonate with people or give them a false idea of what  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:42):**  it is that you can offer them.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:45):**  So once you kind of have clarified that, once you've done that sort of inner work to understand  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:51):**  yourself and your services better, how do you start to put that out there?  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:56):**  What are the channels that you have found success in and that you have seen other people  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:01):**  find success in as well?  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:04):**  One of the biggest pieces of making an impact in any way today is breaking out of the normal  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:11):**  channels that most people are using to connect with others.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:18):**  So being on social media is great and having a great following on Instagram or your Facebook  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:24):**  page is cool for sure.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:27):**  But those numbers don't mean anything if there aren't sales coming into the business.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:30):**  They really don't.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:32):**  You can have the most impressive Facebook page with 20,000 likes, but if you don't know  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:38):**  why you're attracting those people, it's not going to make any difference.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:43):**  The same goes for in-person stuff and that's what I'm leading into is the fact that hands  
**[0:29:48-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:48):**  down in-person interaction is the way to meet people, to make an impression, and make an  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:57):**  impression as yourself.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:00):**  You don't have to put on some weird business persona.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:03):**  People catch onto that so easily, even subconsciously.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:07):**  It's not authentic and anything that's inauthentic just turns people off.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:12):**  I look at things in a very spiritual, kind of energy-centric way, but regardless, if  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:17):**  it turns people off, it turns people off.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:19):**  That means really time misspent and people not helped with your business.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:27):**  Some of the biggest things that have helped for me were just getting involved with some  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:31):**  local groups and especially educational groups.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:36):**  For example, I walked in randomly to a nature center and talked with this guy.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:42):**  This is just an amazing story I have to share.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:45):**  His wife passed away from cancer a few years ago and while she was battling for her life,  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:52):**  he asked her, is it okay if we take the money that we're going to spend on vacations together  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:00):**  and build a nature center at this park?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:03):**  I should take you there.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:04):**  I've been very involved with this place.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:07):**  Yeah, what park is this?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:08):**  This is Sunfish Lake Park in Lake Elmo, Minnesota.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:11):**  Yeah, I'd love to see it, but yeah, go on.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:15):**  It's called Sally Munzer Nature Center.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:17):**  They have a website.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:18):**  Oh my gosh, I could go.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:20):**  We could spend a whole hour talking about it.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:25):**  I got invited to do various things such as run planting days of native prairie plants  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:31):**  with fourth graders.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:32):**  I got to choose all these crazy awesome unusual plants.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:35):**  The kids learned a ton about pollinators and fire ecology.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:38):**  This is very, very fulfilling work for me.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:40):**  It's not the core of my business, but it's another aspect of creating diversified income  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:45):**  streams, which is important.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:48):**  You can run a business solely on design work, and I do help people do that year round, even  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:54):**  in the dead of winter having design work ongoing.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:58):**  It's fun to have that diversity, and most people need that change.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:03):**  When you're getting involved with organizations, while it can be an amazing way to meet people,  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:10):**  show them your expertise by teaching rather than trying to make some inauthentic impression  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:17):**  in a quick conversation.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:22):**  Meeting kids' families, things like that.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:24):**  I've gotten work that way.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:26):**  For example, kids go home and say, oh my god, we saved seeds from this tomato.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:31):**  Then lo and behold, I'm designing edible landscape for the family because the daughter's obsessed  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:35):**  with saving seeds from everything including bananas, which of course most don't have seeds.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:40):**  That we get here.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:43):**  An important aspect of this though, although it can be so effective, is to understand what  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:49):**  your commitment level is.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:52):**  I'm a very, very creative person.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:54):**  I had resisted analytics, numbers, et cetera for so long in my business, and I'm really  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:02):**  coming around to how powerful they are.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:04):**  I'm bringing that more and more into the one-to-one work I do with business owners.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:10):**  How much time are you willing and able to spend doing this type of marketing where you're  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:18):**  building relationships with others, which is very important from a social permaculture  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:22):**  perspective, from a personal health perspective, and it's very effective for the bottom line  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:27):**  of the business when you know what you're offering.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:31):**  If you're spending 20 hours a week volunteering at a school, is it really paying off in terms  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:39):**  of the relationships that you're building turning into your work that's furthering your  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:46):**  ability to do what you're here on this planet to do?  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:51):**  A big aspect of that though is that I've had an amazing relationship with this nature center  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:57):**  because they're paying me for some of the things I do.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:01):**  I do volunteer some other ways.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:02):**  I'm going to be watering a three sisters garden this week because someone's out of town.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:07):**  I chip in in various ways, but if you're making decisions and committing to things with some  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:15):**  vague idea and if it's vague, you can tell if it's not concrete.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:21):**  If you don't have a definitive, yes, this is the activity that's bringing in income  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:27):**  or yes, I am actually getting leads out of this and then having the skills to build those  
**[0:34:33-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:33):**  relationships and make sales, if that's really not set out clearly, and I come back to clarity  
**[0:34:43-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:43):**  all the time because it keeps us on a forward path, on an upward spiral.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:50):**  But yeah, if it's not clear why we're spending all this time hanging out and helping people,  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:56):**  there has to be that exchange, that give and receive.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:01):**  It's just universal law.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:02):**  It needs to be equal or else you're going to get burnt out or their expectations might  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:08):**  not be met and you committed to something.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:11):**  There's ways in which that energy can fall off of the proper channel if it's not clear  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:18):**  as to why it's being spent in a certain direction.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:21):**  Yeah, defining that's pretty key.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:23):**  A lot of what you've talked about seems to be going hand in hand with developing a holistic  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:27):**  lifestyle that integrates you with the community and business clients and leads and those types  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:33):**  of client relationships are almost just a side effect of that.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:37):**  It has much more to do with building social capital and monetary capital is one of the  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:42):**  things that can come from that depending on how you manage it.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:46):**  But let's talk about something that you touched on just a second ago is diversity of income.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:51):**  And like you said, it is possible to make a good living just through a design firm or  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:56):**  consulting, but especially for people of our generation, the millennial generation, though  
**[0:36:02-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:02):**  I'm kind of on the older end of it, they are looking into a different type of, let's say,  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:10):**  career resilience, whereas the previous model used to be work for a company that was large  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:15):**  enough to offer benefits and all of these things.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:19):**  That option is becoming less and less secure for so many of us, especially those of us  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:24):**  who get into entrepreneurial endeavors and start to work for ourselves or do sort of  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:28):**  freelance work.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:30):**  What are some of the other options that you've seen aside from just ecological design consultancy  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:37):**  and perhaps teaching workshops from time to time that are profitable endeavors with either  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:44):**  colleagues that you've worked with or that you've seen successful examples of in the  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:49):**  sphere in which we work?  
**[0:36:51-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:51):**  Yeah, really the biggest piece that it comes down to is cultivating the awareness of our  
**[0:37:01-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:01):**  own innate gifts and what we love to do and being aware of opportunities to apply those  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:10):**  in various ways.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:11):**  So there's a lot of different ways in which people might be involved.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:18):**  From an entrepreneurial perspective, it's a little bit different than say an ecological  
**[0:37:26-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:26):**  designer could easily become a fundraising donor relations manager for a land conservancy  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:36):**  or something.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:37):**  There's a lot of ways in which an ecological background can turn into something a little  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:42):**  different in that way, but that's more of what I would consider being an employee.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:49):**  So as far as being an entrepreneur and finding alternative ways beyond...  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:55):**  So when you mentioned consulting, I mean that's such a broad thing, right?  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:59):**  Because it's a service.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:00):**  You're just offering a service that's helping address some issue for somebody.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:04):**  So that's very diverse.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:06):**  You could be helping people with soil health.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:09):**  You could be helping them diagnose plant diseases.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:12):**  You could be consulting on creating interior, rewilding people's interiors of their homes  
**[0:38:21-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:21):**  or gosh, there's so many things or creating a sustainability plan for a city, recycling  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:29):**  program, composting, et cetera.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:32):**  And that's just the scratching the surface.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:33):**  I've been talking with somebody recently who does fish genetic analysis and looking at  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:38):**  creating a consulting business around that potentially.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:41):**  So there's other alternative things.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:45):**  There's the whole side of product creation and marketing.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:49):**  For me, for example, I think I can give a more in-depth...  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:54):**  This has some diversity in with it too.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:56):**  I'm part of a small collective in Spring Green, Wisconsin, which is 45 minutes west of Madison.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:04):**  And there's a farm there that my friend Robin has inherited with her brother.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:09):**  It's 160 acres.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:10):**  You and I have talked about it a bit.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:12):**  And I'll be living there next growing season because we are creating an educational farm  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:21):**  and retreat center.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:23):**  So every cover type on that property from Prairie to Woodland to geothermal greenhouse  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:30):**  to riparian area will have programming and production associated with it so that each  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:37):**  cover type on that property is providing the income for its own enhancement over time.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:43):**  So what that entails is, yes, I will be consulting.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:46):**  I'll be creating a proposal this summer and we'll be looking for funding and bringing  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:53):**  in the United Designers to do a plan for that.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:59):**  But also, beyond that, there is so much programming that's going to be happening on that piece  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:04):**  of land.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:05):**  So really, education is such a huge part of what we do as consultants anyway.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:12):**  And regardless of at which whatever level the public is at in terms of their knowledge  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:18):**  of certain skills, of certain ways of being and connecting with the earth and others around  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:23):**  them, there will always be opportunities to educate.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:26):**  But especially now as we're building that inevitable momentum of the wave cresting where  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:35):**  regenerative lifestyle and the higher standard of living that can easily be had by being  
**[0:40:40-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:40):**  connected to the earth and each other on a deeper and deeper level, where that becomes  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:47):**  the norm.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:48):**  There's a lot of education that's needed and wanted desperately in both situations where  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:55):**  people want nature immersion.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:56):**  They want to learn wild edibles.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:58):**  They want to learn how to grow veggies, build their own timber frame home or straw bale,  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:04):**  whatever.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:05):**  So that's a huge part of what's going to be happening on that farm.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:07):**  So that's an aspect of that diversity is being a facilitator of that type of programming,  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:15):**  that type of education, products that come off of the land or that just help people out  
**[0:41:21-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:21):**  in general because all we're doing with that piece of property is fulfilling a huge gap  
**[0:41:28-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:28):**  in the availability of healthy local fresh food, the connection between the soil and  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:35):**  our gut health, mental health, et cetera.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:40):**  That's what I see is that awareness of what are the real issues going on here today.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:45):**  And yeah, plastic in the oceans is an issue, but people aren't necessarily going to pay  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:52):**  you.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:53):**  I mean, there are people that get paid to clean up plastic in the oceans, for example,  
**[0:41:57-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:57):**  but if you're walking around Twin Cities, Minnesota, selling a service to clean up the  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:04):**  plastic in the ocean or something, it has to relate to, yeah, maybe it relates to somebody  
**[0:42:09-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:09):**  feeling a relief of some displaced guilt or something, but.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:16):**  Well tell me how this sits with you, because as ecological designers, we talk so much about  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:20):**  the observation process and trying to give as much time and attention to that to make  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:26):**  educated decisions on how to affect the landscape in which we're interacting.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:31):**  And I think that that applies so much to the business model as well.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:36):**  And if you don't take enough time to really understand the community that you intend to  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:40):**  serve, whether it be online, whether it be in your immediate vicinity or somewhere off  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:44):**  somewhere else, you're not going to tap into what the needs, what the pressure points,  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:51):**  what the desires of those communities that you're aiming to serve are.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:55):**  And you might really find that the services or the products that you care to offer are  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:00):**  very different from what you initially thought you had to offer based on those needs and  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:05):**  desires of the community if you're paying attention.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:07):**  And I know I've come to a lot of different conclusions, partly because I've moved around  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:11):**  the world so much in my adult life, that each place has sort of unique circumstances that  
**[0:43:17-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:17):**  would make something that you're able to offer valuable to that community.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:24):**  Thinking outside of just what you thought you wanted to provide and what these places  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:29):**  actually need or desire could really be the difference between a successful business model,  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:35):**  no matter how positive it might be, and one that struggles just for sort of, I guess,  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:42):**  short-cutting that observation process, which we put so much time and effort into when we're  
**[0:43:46-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:46):**  looking into natural systems.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:50-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:50):**  So one of the biggest game changers for me around that has been cultivating this openness  
**[0:44:01-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:01):**  to the fact that there is, well, for example, if someone's in a state of experiencing the  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:09):**  scarcity mindset, there's no reason why an hour later they couldn't make a $5,000 sale  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:15):**  in their business or the next day.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:19):**  But in our communities and context, it really comes down to context, but there are solutions  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:27):**  that we can offer with our skills, with our gifts, with our personal interests that are  
**[0:44:33-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:33):**  very economically viable in a lot of different ways and different levels where there is a  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:41):**  service that we can offer that just unlocks the whole world for us and really gets at  
**[0:44:47-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:47):**  the heart of what people are seeking in terms of the transformation for them.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:52):**  Because whenever somebody makes a purchase, regardless of whether it's in their business  
**[0:44:56-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:56):**  and they're joining a business mastermind or they're trying to fix up their home in  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:04):**  a certain way, that sale is a transformation.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:08):**  It's a personal healing.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:11):**  And it should be, at least, and that's when it feels great for everybody involved.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:17):**  So in order to get to that place where somebody is making a purchase and they just can't wait  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:22):**  to hand you that check because they know how much it's going to benefit them and it can  
**[0:45:26-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:26):**  feel that fresh air coming into their life, creating those connections that bring that  
**[0:45:34-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:34):**  context from the standpoint of, we're only here for a finite amount of time.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:41):**  And so to sit behind a computer or not be out there connecting with others, people might  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:48):**  describe themselves as an introvert or whatnot.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:52):**  I'm an introvert, but all that means for me is that I gain my batteries recharged when  
**[0:45:57-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:57):**  I spend time alone in nature, especially.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:59):**  Yeah, same with me.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:03):**  So if you're in the consulting industry, a consulting business, you've got to be excited  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:09):**  about interacting with people and to be able to understand, if you're not feeling excited  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:16):**  about interacting with people, is that just because you don't have a clearly defined package  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:20):**  and offer or is it because you're maybe not in the right business is definitely a question  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:25):**  to ask.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:26):**  But as far as being open to the excitement of understanding where in this person's life,  
**[0:46:36-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:36):**  in this experience, do they have something going on that I can help with?  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:44):**  First of all, knowing what you do help with is an important piece of that.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:47):**  So you can know, am I just having a conversation with somebody that's friendly and it really  
**[0:46:55-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:55):**  doesn't have potential right now as a client who's going to sign on and work with me or  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:02):**  is this person just the perfect fit?  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:05):**  And it's so different for each business and it's different for each location, especially  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:10):**  regionally.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:12):**  But being able to be yourself, be that excited, open, optimistic person, it's easy to get  
**[0:47:21-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:21):**  closed off, especially early on in business and be afraid of making mistakes or putting  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:30):**  oneself out there.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:33):**  But it only ever is a benefit because that's the only way we're really going to understand  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:41):**  what people are seeking and how we can actually be of service in the world.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:45):**  I love that.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:46):**  And it really flies in the face of what you've heard in so many different spheres of performance  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:51):**  where the concept of fake it till you make it or kind of put on a front until you can  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:57):**  actually live it genuinely, I think is really starting to erode.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:01):**  As you mentioned earlier, too, with the internet, with so many options available to us and the  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:08):**  messages constantly bombarding our sphere, it's getting easier and easier to tell the  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:13):**  authentic ones, the ones that are coming from a place of honesty and very easy to weed out  
**[0:48:18-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:18):**  the ones that aren't.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:19):**  And I really think that, you know, sort of to break with that narrative, there's no shame  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:25):**  in in talking about where you are in your journey and knowing that increasingly a lot  
**[0:48:30-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:30):**  of people are going to resonate with that message and could be even the thing that creates  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:35):**  the relationships that propel you to another level.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:40):**  What are some of the other factors in sort of unlocking the potential or I guess getting  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:47):**  past the hurdles or maybe what are the hurdles that you see holding back eco minded entrepreneurs  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:53):**  or socially minded entrepreneurs in that way?  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:56):**  I think a big thing is, you know, I had a really powerful experience in my own business  
**[0:49:02-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:02):**  recently with this, but it's so I would say it's so easy to get lost in that, that scarcity  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:11):**  mindset or that, oh, I really need to make this sale.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:16):**  But it's also easy to come from a place of, you know, genuinely seeking to understand  
**[0:49:24-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:24):**  somebody.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:25):**  But there's, you know, those are two sides of the same, the same coin, really.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:31):**  Because who we are, when we're interacting with the people that, you know, may become  
**[0:49:36-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:36):**  our clients, it really comes down to cultivating our ability to be present.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:47):**  And the reason why we're getting into ecological design is not to make money, right?  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:52):**  That's not the primary motivator.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:54):**  I do a lot of money mindset work with my clients, because it's a really important part of making  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:59):**  sales and not being concerned about, you know, the price that you're giving something at  
**[0:50:04-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:04):**  the value in which, you know, the level at which a value based design, you know, is priced,  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:12):**  for example, because if we are this, what I'm saying is that this money mindset thing  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:19):**  is one of the biggest obstacles.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:21):**  It's so pervasive in modern culture, and especially in our permaculture ecological design communities,  
**[0:50:31-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:31):**  and it holds 80% of people back from having a successful business.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:36):**  And there's a spectrum like anything, you know, some people might be so against the  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:40):**  idea of money that they're living off grid, and don't have, you know, a phone because  
**[0:50:46-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:46):**  they don't want to support any anything related to the idea of capitalism.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:50):**  And I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:52):**  But then there are other people who are really trying hard in their business, and they're  
**[0:50:56-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:56):**  going around to having sales conversations, but they're so focused on the concern about  
**[0:51:03-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:03):**  the sale falling through, or saying the right thing, that they're not being authentic.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:10):**  They're not understanding what the client's really looking for, and thus their package  
**[0:51:14-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:14):**  isn't aligning with the client's needs.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:16):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:18):**  And you know, like you said, many of these narratives are really pervasive in entrepreneurial  
**[0:51:23-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:23):**  circles, especially startup circles, and kind of to transition out here before we wrap up,  
**[0:51:32-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:32):**  what is some advice that you would give to people, especially in their beginning phases  
**[0:51:36-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:36):**  of starting their own business or breaking out on their own, either to keep in mind that  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:41):**  will kind of guide them through some of the hurdles that they're inevitably going to face  
**[0:51:45-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:45):**  as early stage entrepreneurs, or maybe tips from your own experience that helped you get  
**[0:51:52-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:52):**  past a lot of the roadblocks or the hurdles of the initial stages?  
**[0:51:59-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:59):**  Top of the list is be excited about what you're doing.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:03):**  And be assertive.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:04):**  You know, it's not about being the know it all, encyclopedia brown of the consulting  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:10):**  industry you're in, or you know, landscape design, whatnot.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:15):**  But if you are genuinely excited, and ready for a challenge, you know, so many designers  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:22):**  when they're starting out hold themselves back because they think, oh, my drawing skills  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:26):**  aren't good enough, or I don't know my plants well enough, things like that.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:31):**  And you know, while there are real needs as far as our expertise, in terms of selecting  
**[0:52:36-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:36):**  the right thing for a certain spot or whatnot, or certain situation, you know, what's stopping  
**[0:52:44-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:44):**  you from learning other than your own mindset?  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:48):**  So you know, people might be timid in a conversation telling somebody about what they do, what's  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:54):**  the point?  
**[0:52:56-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:56):**  You're just telling somebody what you're doing, you're not committing yourself to designing  
**[0:52:59-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:59):**  some breakwater on the edge of Lake Superior, or that requires insane engineering or something.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:06):**  You know, it's, I think a lot of a lot of people at any level of experience, but especially  
**[0:53:11-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:11):**  starting out, they see the future is unknown, of course, from making sales to the types  
**[0:53:21-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:21):**  of projects to the types of clients they'll be interacting with, what's going to come  
**[0:53:24-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:24):**  up.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:26):**  And they rather than moving toward a place of love, they get caught in that place of  
**[0:53:32-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:32):**  fear, which results in constriction in the voice in the way one might interact with other  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:39):**  people, and then the resulting symptom beyond that is constriction of the business.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:44):**  And the only expansive thing in our universe is just this sheer joy of being alive, of  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:53):**  movement of fluidity.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:57):**  So you know, it's a total fractalization of our inner state.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:03):**  And so being really excited about what we're doing, telling people, yeah, I designed edible  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:06):**  landscapes, you know, what's wrong with telling somebody about that if you're super passionate  
**[0:54:11-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:11):**  about it, rather than allowing this fear of, oh, I don't want to mess up their property,  
**[0:54:17-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:17):**  so I'm going to be, you know, really bashful about saying what I do.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:21):**  You know, you don't have enough information to even know if that person's a right fit.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:26):**  You're just telling them, yeah, heck yeah, I'm super stoked to be talking to you and  
**[0:54:31-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:31):**  I design edible landscapes.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:33):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:34):**  You want to know more?  
**[0:54:37-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:38):**  And I would say to just to add on to that, the one thing that has really helped me and  
**[0:54:43-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:43):**  I have been really thick headed about it from the beginning is asking for help.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:48):**  I don't know where this mentality comes in, especially around, and I definitely find it  
**[0:54:53-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:53):**  more in the United States than in so many other countries where I've lived in where  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:56):**  collaboration and closeness of community and family is much more prevalent.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:01):**  But this idea that, you know, it's somehow a bigger success if you did it by yourself  
**[0:55:06-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:06):**  or succeed as much if you asked for help along the way is horrible.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:13):**  It really holds people back for a long, long time.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:17):**  And you know, this podcast in particular is probably my most consistent effort in the  
**[0:55:22-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:22):**  last couple of years of consistently asking for help and reaching out to people who I've  
**[0:55:27-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:27):**  always wanted to talk to to get their advice and ask the questions after reading their  
**[0:55:32-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:32):**  books or, you know, consuming their content or admiring their work.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:36):**  And you know, along that line, Pete, could you tell our listeners at home how they can  
**[0:55:40-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:40):**  get in contact with you?  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:42):**  Because your advice, your guidance, your friendship has been really helpful for me since we've  
**[0:55:47-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:47):**  known each other.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:48):**  And I would really recommend that if anybody else is starting out in these types of spheres,  
**[0:55:53-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:53):**  that they at least get to know some of the content that you've put out there.  
**[0:55:57-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:57):**  So how can they find you?  
**[0:55:58-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:58):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:59):**  And I, I love our friendship as well.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:01):**  Oliver.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:02):**  It's been awesome.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:03):**  Yeah, so I am getting a new website up called petewiden.com.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:09):**  So that's petewiden2eyes.com slash discover will be the page where you can explore setting  
**[0:56:19-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:19):**  up a call with me to talk about what it might look like to get real results in your business,  
**[0:56:25-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:25):**  wherever you may be in it.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:27):**  And also, most actively, if you want to interact with me on a daily basis, I am on Facebook  
**[0:56:34-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:34):**  at the epic eco designer Facebook group, and we have almost 900 people in there now.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:40):**  It's an active group and we are unfolding some really exciting stuff over the next couple  
**[0:56:45-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:45):**  months to build the connectivity and efficacy of that network on Facebook.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:51):**  And you can also find me on Instagram at Pete Wyden.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:56):**  Yeah, and you guys can find me on that same group.

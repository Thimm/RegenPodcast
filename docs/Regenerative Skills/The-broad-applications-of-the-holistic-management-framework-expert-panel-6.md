**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:05):**  Hey there everybody, and welcome to the sixth of the monthly expert panel discussions.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:12):**  As I mentioned before, each month I'll be hosting discussions and debates between some  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:16):**  of the most prominent voices in regenerative agriculture, soil science, restoration land  
**[0:01:21-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:21):**  management, and a lot more.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:23):**  In this session, I hosted a discussion on the Holistic Management Framework with my  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:27):**  friends and colleagues at Climate Farmers, which is a non-profit organization working  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:31):**  to advance regenerative agriculture in Europe.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:34):**  Now in this panel I got to speak with three of the most experienced and influential educators  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:38):**  from the global network of Savory Hubs in order to share their knowledge about the wide  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:43):**  applications of the Holistic Management Framework.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:47):**  Since holistic management is often only associated with animal grazing, I wanted to hear from  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:51):**  the women today about how relevant and influential it can be for people, not only in other types  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:01:57):**  of farming businesses, but also in other aspects of life.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:01):**  Now in my work with the farming community that we're building across Europe, the topic  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:04):**  of holistic management keeps coming up because of this framework's focus on managing the  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:09):**  complexity that other forms of decision making work to simplify and reduce.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:14):**  In contrast to those methods, the idea of managing anything, from a business to a community,  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:19):**  relationship, or government holistically involves understanding the whole and all of the complexities  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:25):**  within it.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:26):**  This is especially necessary when working with living systems and the unpredictable  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:31):**  aspects that come with it.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:34):**  Since these discussions are longer than the regular weekly episodes, I'll keep this intro  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:02:37):**  short and jump right into the introductions for our panelists, starting with Precious

**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:03:16):**  and wildlife.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:03:17):**  And we've also got Sheila Cook with us today, who works to enable farmers to regenerate  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:03:22):**  soils while sustaining a higher quality of life as a hub leader for 3LM, Land and Livestock

**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:03:43):**  And that leads us to Sarah Gleason, who is a first-generation bison rancher based in

**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:03:55):**  for regenerative agriculture and conservation.

**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:04):**  worldwide, Sarah launched into full-time ranching herself.

**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:18):**  community, regenerating the environment, and producing thriving animals.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:23):**  Now to get us started, I want to start with a bit of an ambitious question.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:28):**  And I would love to know, before we get into the technical aspects of holistic management  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:32):**  and grazing, perhaps from each of you, a little bit about the use of this program of holistic  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:39):**  management and the way of making decisions that it outlines and how it's affected your  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:44):**  own work and relationship to the land, perhaps starting with Precious.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:50):**  Thank you.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:51):**  Thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:53):**  So hi, everyone, and I'm really glad to be on this panel with Sheila and Sarah.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:04:59):**  They are such incredible inspiration of mine personally, and I'm so glad that we're here  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:08):**  today.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:09):**  Well, it's tonight on my end.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:14):**  Okay, so basically, I think my journey with holistic management started when I was very  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:23):**  young and still in college, and I bumped into the amazing work that they were doing in the  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:31):**  rural communities where I actually live.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:35):**  So the Savory Hub here in Zimbabwe is literally within the lens that I grew up.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:41):**  It's called Wangi Komeno lens.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:43):**  So I mean, to go straight into what you've asked, Oliver, I think holistic management  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:51):**  is really beyond just wildlife management or land management.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:05:55):**  It really is an integral part of life of anyone who has started the journey, because every  
**[0:06:04-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:04):**  other decision after that, you do not make decisions just the way that we used to before  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:12):**  you actually encountered the whole body of knowledge.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:16):**  And I work directly and I still collaborate with the Savory Hub here in Zimbabwe, which  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:22):**  is called the Africa Center for Holistic Management, and consistently have been really privileged  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:27):**  to be in contact and in some instances really sit under Alan Savory and Geordie Butterfield  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:33):**  is they continuously share their new lessons.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:38):**  So the learning is never ending, and I think we continue to evolve with the journey.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:44):**  And most parts, it has affected how I relate to people, how I relate to the land that I  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:51):**  manage, how I relate to the programs that I design, because I actually work in community-owned  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:06:58):**  pieces of land where the social organizing is also involved over and above the technical  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:04):**  aspects of holistic management.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:06):**  So I think it has really affected how I just relate to things and think through things  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:10):**  in general.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:11):**  So yeah, that's broad and that's how I tackle it.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:18):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:19):**  Sheila, would you like to jump in and tell us how this management system has affected  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:24):**  your own life and your work?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:26):**  Sure, thanks Oliver.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:30):**  And I too am so delighted to be here with Precious and Sarah.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:34):**  Thank you for having us.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:38):**  Interestingly, I'm not a farmer.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:41):**  I've never been a farmer.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:44):**  And what attracted my husband, Christopher, and me to holistic management is the fact  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:51):**  that it's holistic.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:07:53):**  And our work prior to encountering holistic management has been around human change and  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:02):**  supporting human change.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:05):**  And what we knew long before we encountered holistic management was the way to regenerate  
**[0:08:13-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:13):**  planet Earth is to support the shift of the human mind to the place where it has the capacity  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:23):**  to manage the complexity that we've created for ourselves so that we can make better quality  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:30):**  decisions that will result in regenerating Earth.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:36):**  And so when we found holistic management, what happened was the St. Louis Institute  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:41):**  gave a conference in London, which we didn't attend.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:45):**  We didn't know about it.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:46):**  But one of Christopher's good friends attended and said, oh, this is right up your street.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:55):**  And then Christopher checked into it.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:08:59):**  And he said to me immediately, oh, Sheila, this is what I've been looking for for 20  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:05):**  years.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:06):**  And I haven't found it.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:07):**  I think we found it finally with this framework for helping people move into this capacity  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:14):**  for holistic decision making.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:17):**  And he had me look at it and I go, you want me to do what?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:23):**  Because I was vegan at the time.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:25):**  And I said, you want us to help people manage livestock?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:29):**  Are you out of your mind?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:32):**  And he said, oh, yeah, really, this is really the real thing.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:35):**  You got to believe me.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:36):**  That's right.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:37):**  And so he had me watch the Ellen Savory TED talk.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:40):**  And immediately the next day we applied to become a hub.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:46):**  And the rest is history.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:47):**  So it's been completely life changing for me, I have to say.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:52):**  Wow, that's a really compelling story.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:56):**  I love that turnaround and change of perspective.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:09:58):**  Sarah, how about yourself?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:00):**  I know that you have recently gotten into ranching, relatively speaking.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:05):**  And how has this framework informed the way that you run your ranch?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:11):**  I think I have the thank you for including me.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:14):**  It's incredible.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:15):**  I worked with Sheila and Precious in all sorts of different capacities over the years.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:20):**  So it's really fun to be in this role now.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:23):**  I had the amazing opportunity to see practitioners in Zimbabwe or in the UK or wherever in the  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:30):**  world who are managing holistically and obviously something different was happening and then  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:36):**  getting to learn from Alan himself.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:37):**  But for me, it really starts with the holistic context.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:42):**  Holistic context is the cornerstone of anything else in holistic management, right?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:47):**  Because how can we possibly make decisions if we don't have a guiding light of what we  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:53):**  are trying to create and what we want those outcomes to look like.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:10:58):**  And so even before I jumped into full-time ranching, I still had a personal holistic  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:02):**  context.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:03):**  My husband and I had a family holistic context.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:06):**  Now we have a list of context for the business itself.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:09):**  When apprentices come to the ranch, the first thing we do is form a holistic context between  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:14):**  ourselves and the apprentice.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:17):**  Before contracts are created on leased land, holistic contexts are created with the landowners.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:23):**  And then we start talking about legal contracts.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:27):**  And it's game changing.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:28):**  I mean, when you take the time to sit down and build that cornerstone, that every other  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:33):**  decision is then going to look back on.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:38):**  And when you do your testing questions on making decisions, you have a cornerstone of  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:43):**  what those testing questions are actually leading you towards.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:47):**  It's game changing.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:48):**  And it also allows, I feel like myself, to get a kind of a bigger perspective.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:11:55):**  It's so easy, I feel like, in any sort of daily work, and especially in ranching, to  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:00):**  almost just get in survivor mode and to do what's been working.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:04):**  You know, like, this is what I know, this is what we've done before, we're just going  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:07):**  to drive, drive, drive ahead, because we're so busy, we just got to go, go, go.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:11):**  And getting in the business like that, and in the logistics and work, sometimes we lose  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:17):**  sight of, wait, do we have to do it this way?  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:20):**  Or if we did it a different way, or are we losing something?  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:24):**  Are we losing a quality of life?  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:26):**  Are we losing, you know, ecological health that we could have if we did it differently?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:32):**  So anyways, I think having that holistic context, that's a living, breathing document that is,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:37):**  you know, reviewed, at least on an annual basis, with all parties included, just allows  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:43):**  an incredible perspective for life in general, and for any operation.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:49):**  Very well said.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:50):**  And I think between the three of you, you've made a great case for how widely applied this  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:55):**  can be.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:12:56):**  And though, Sarah, you're directly applying it to what people know holistic management  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:00):**  most for, which is animal grazing.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:03):**  Precious, you've been teaching this way of making decisions for a really long time.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:07):**  Can you tell us how far it can extend beyond what it's known for in animal grazing, mostly,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:14):**  and some of the, I guess, out of the box applications that you've seen this become successful in  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:20):**  helping to manage?  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:24):**  So I work mostly with agro pastoral farmers.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:29):**  And I think what Sarah, I'll just build on what Sarah said on the importance of actually  
**[0:13:36-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:36):**  using the holistic context as your guide in decision making and having mutually progressive  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:46):**  conversations.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:48):**  Because sometimes when you work with diverse groups, you have diversities of religious  
**[0:13:53-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:13:53):**  differences, political differences that can really cloud decision making or cloud the  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:02):**  desires that people have.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:03):**  But then when you first use the holistic context to spell out what everyone desires in terms  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:11):**  of for their lives and their future, their children, we are finding out almost every  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:17):**  day that people want the same thing, regardless of any other social difference.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:24):**  But unfortunately, the social differences that we have actually can become a blockade  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:30):**  of all the other possibilities.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:32):**  So this, yeah, so this is just in brief how we've used it.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:37):**  And sometimes you enter into a community that has rife conflict.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:42):**  But dialogue is very important.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:45):**  It's very critical.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:46):**  I personally think that actually working through the complexities of actually holistically  
**[0:14:52-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:14:52):**  planning grazing, holistically planning land use or use of any kind is technically easier  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:02):**  than to actually get people to converse and dialogue in a way that will make them then  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:09):**  be able to actually then plan.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:11):**  So I think it's been useful for social cohesion and building relations and commitment.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:19):**  Nice.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:20):**  And Sheila, with your work through the 3LM organization based in the UK, with these other  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:27):**  applications for business building and especially financial management, can you go through some  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:32):**  of the steps to defining a holistic context aside from managing the animals, perhaps applying  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:40):**  it, like I said, to business, to the finance of an operation?  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:44):**  Sure.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:45):**  But can I just tell you an example?  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:49):**  I have one for the question you gave, Precious, that's really interesting.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:53):**  Oh, by all means.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:15:56):**  We trained a French chef in holistic management.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:02):**  And he went home and he wanted to practice holistic management right away.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:07):**  And his wife is a massage therapist for health benefit.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:14):**  And she rides a scooter from client to client and gives this massage therapy in people's  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:21):**  houses.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:22):**  And she was exhausted and never took a vacation and never took a holiday, working really long  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:29):**  hours.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:30):**  And he said, we're going to use a holistic grazing plan to get you on a better track.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:38):**  And so they used the holistic grazing plan.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:42):**  And the result was she worked then instead of five days a week, four days a week.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:49):**  And instead of 10 hours a day and coming home exhausted, she was leaving home around 10  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:16:55):**  in the morning and coming home between four and five in the afternoon.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:01):**  And instead of having no holiday, she was getting six weeks of holiday because they  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:08):**  planned it in.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:09):**  And then instead of making little profit, she made a lot of profit.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:14):**  So I guess that answers both the questions.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:17):**  It did, but it's very mystical.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:20):**  I'm wondering if you can unpack that a little bit because it sounds like they just waved  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:24):**  the wand and then her life was better.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:26):**  Can you break that down about how she started to achieve those things?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:31):**  So when you're using a grazing chart and following the aid memoir of holistic plan grazing, you're  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:40):**  managing complexity.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:42):**  And the grazing chart actually was inspired by the work of the British military.  
**[0:17:50-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:17:50):**  And they were moving large armies across large land masses, which is complex in the way that  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:00):**  it is complex to move animals across land masses.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:04):**  You're just managing a whole bunch of information.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:08):**  And it's hard for the human mind or even a computer, it's hard for a computer to figure  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:15):**  out how to manage all the complexity that that involves.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:20):**  So a grazing chart is big.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:23):**  It's an A1 size, like a poster size sheet of paper.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:27):**  And then there's all these little pockets where you put information about what you're  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:32):**  managing.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:33):**  And then you can see it all on one great big page.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:37):**  All the constraints, it's a lot of constraints that you're dealing with.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:42):**  And then it becomes obvious to you, oh, I need to start here.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:46):**  And then I would go here and then I would go here.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:49):**  And then you eventually get to a problem, you rub it all out and you go, oh, I got to  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:18:54):**  start over again, until you finally make a route that is going to make sense this year.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:01):**  And because the farm is a different farm every year, you got to change it up.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:07):**  But the same would be true for planning a route through the city of Bordeaux to deliver  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:13):**  massage therapy.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:15):**  There's lots of constraints and they would have been able to put them on the grazing  
**[0:19:19-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:19):**  chart and then work out what is a logical route that would minimize travel time and  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:28):**  de-stress her.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:29):**  And like, for example, you could put it on here in Bordeaux, don't go through these parts  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:36):**  of town at this time of day.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:41):**  And that would save a lot of time if you knew that, right?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:46):**  Yeah, that's good.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:48):**  That gives us an idea of certainly a context that we're not used to looking at this framework  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:53):**  through, or at least it's not as well known.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:19:56):**  But it would be somewhat remiss if we didn't focus somewhat on animal grazing because of  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:02):**  that reason.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:03):**  So Sarah, since you're the one who's actively working at grazing animals, can you tell us  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:07):**  about how you've applied this decision making process to not just manage your animals in  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:13):**  a way that is conducive to your business, but also regenerative for the landscape that  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:18):**  you're managing?  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:19):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:22):**  Right now we are in the worst drought in the last hundred years.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:25):**  We're in, for those of you who don't know, I'm in the US and Colorado, Southwest Colorado  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:30):**  specifically.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:33):**  And just really stressful time for water.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:38):**  I might run out of water, like stock water, drinking water this year, water that I've  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:42):**  had available for months to flood irrigate hundreds of acres.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:48):**  I don't have at all.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:49):**  So in those pastures, I'm getting maybe 25% growth, forage, of what I get on a average  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:20:58):**  year.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:00):**  And so when things like that happen, the grazing plan is critical because it allows me to take  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:07):**  a step back to actually look what's going on in each of my pastures to get creative,  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:13):**  to make a plan as far as where I need to be when, to pay better attention to whether pastures  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:19):**  are ready even to be grazed.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:22):**  And realistically in a year like this, I am going to hammer and overuse probably all of  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:27):**  my pastures this year.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:28):**  I'm going to eat the drought reserve because this is the drought.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:32):**  And when that happens, the amazing thing about holistic management and the grazing plan is  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:39):**  to give us visual on the consequences.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:43):**  So lots of times we make decisions, and because of managing complexity, there are unintended  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:50):**  consequences.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:52):**  This allows me to make intended consequences.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:21:55):**  So I know, for example, that I am currently, it's springtime here, and I am currently hammering  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:03):**  one pasture, totally overusing it.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:05):**  Every time a new piece of grass is coming up, it's getting bit, but I need to stay there  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:10):**  because the rest of the pastures are not ready.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:13):**  And I will do more damage by going and biting those plants before those plants have recovered  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:19):**  to a stage two, stage three growth.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:22):**  By biting it now, I will do more long-term damage if I go.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:27):**  So next year, when I pull out my grazing plan, there will be notes.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:30):**  There'll be notes that say, this pasture you were in much too long last spring, don't be  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:37):**  here next spring because different than rotational grazing, rotational grazing people think they  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:42):**  make this rotation, they set the schedule, and that's where they go when.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:46):**  And it's kind of a repeat system, right?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:49):**  But lots of times then you end up being in the same place at the same time with the same  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:53):**  behavior year over year over year.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:22:56):**  And sometimes that can actually cause worse long-term consequences.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:01):**  So for example, if I came back next spring and repeated what I'm currently doing in this  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:06):**  one pasture, I'm pointing that way because the pasture is that way.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:11):**  Then if I did that each year, eventually that pasture is going to turn to bare ground and  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:16):**  sagebrush.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:17):**  But if I do it one year and next year I give it extra time to regrow and I am somewhere  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:22):**  else in the spring, that pasture will recover.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:25):**  And in fact, it might even recover better because there's going to be such a concentration  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:30):**  of dung and urine and organic matter from feeding hay up there right now.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:34):**  But my point, I mean, those are really integrate, you know, like details on my operation specifically.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:41):**  But the point is that the grazing plan allows me, kind of like what Sheila was saying, it  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:46):**  allows me to see it as a whole and plan those moves intentionally.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:50):**  And then the next year I have this documented resource of what happened when this pasture  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:23:55):**  was underused, this pasture was overused, this pasture, you know, heard of a hundred  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:02):**  elk were in it for an entire month because they were pushed down from the higher elevations  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:06):**  looking for feed.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:08):**  You know, all those sort of complexities that happen when managing land and livestock or  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:13):**  hey, remember when you went on that, you know, week long trip and you didn't feel comfortable  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:18):**  having the animals in this pasture, so you left them here a week too long.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:23):**  That's all part of it, right?  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:25):**  Because I'm not just managing land and livestock, I'm also managing my life.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:29):**  And so I need to make note of all those things in the grazing plan and plan accordingly.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:34):**  Does that answer the question?  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:37):**  It does.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:38):**  And it gives some really important examples.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:39):**  Like you were mentioning the severity of the drought that you're going through is not something  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:43):**  that people have reference to.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:44):**  A lot of them associate holistic management with rotational grazing as if they were the  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:49):**  same thing.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:50):**  And Precious, because you have so much experience teaching this in also quite a brittle climate,  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:55):**  can you tell us some of those key differences kind of expanding on what Sarah mentioned  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:24:59):**  and also some of the differences with conventional management of livestock, especially from your  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:04):**  region of Zimbabwe?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:07):**  Thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:08):**  I just wanted to build on what Sarah so nicely put.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:12):**  I think just also expressing the importance of actually planning on a chart than just  
**[0:25:19-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:19):**  a calendar, because as Sheila and Sarah have said, the chart captures a lot more than just  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:28):**  land issues, but it's animal needs, land needs, and farmer needs as well.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:35):**  So it manages for both social, economic, and biological systems to thrive.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:41):**  And there's no way to plan that only in your head.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:46):**  So you want to do it like that.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:48):**  It's a very simplified form that we use as communal farmers.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:25:57):**  And I think even for ranchers like Sarah, you can literally follow through what this  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:02):**  is communicating to you.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:04):**  And even if Sarah needed to immediately rush somewhere, someone can literally use that  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:10):**  chart to keep the bison moving.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:14):**  And what's important, I wanted to capture the fact that every time you are doing any  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:21):**  plan at all in living systems because of the complexities, you do it from such a humble  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:27):**  perspective of always assuming that you are wrong.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:31):**  And that helps you really become a student and monitor diligently the processes that  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:37):**  the land or your organization is giving you as a feedback.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:41):**  So in this case, we're talking about holistic plant grazing.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:44):**  So when you have implemented your plans, you don't just go and sit in the office and like,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:49):**  yeah, let's keep the animals moving.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:50):**  So every day you're consistently monitoring the health of the animal, the health of the  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:54):**  land, how much impact the animals have left on the land.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:26:58):**  Do we need to keep moving fast, especially if you're in the growing season?  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:02):**  Because now you are grazing so that you do not over-graze, but actually get lots of growth.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:08):**  So that's recovery.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:09):**  And that looks different everywhere, which will help me also dive into your question  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:14):**  of brittle environments.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:16):**  I'm in an environment where precipitation is very limited, but also really happens,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:26):**  rainfalls here happen in such a short space of time.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:29):**  I'll just say maybe we have solid rainfall of about three months, and then the rest of  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:34):**  the year is dry.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:36):**  So that means every time when it rains, biological systems are really very active and you have  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:43):**  lots of growth because the temperatures are also good and moisture is present.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:47):**  And so now when your animals visit that land and they graze, it's prudent to always make  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:53):**  sure that they move as quick so that you have your recovery periods.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:27:57):**  And here we always start at least 90 days recovery periods before we can go back to  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:04):**  bring our animals back to actually graze the plants again.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:09):**  So in the non-growing season, in some parts of the world, people can have snow, which  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:15):**  is some sort of moisture, but maybe the temperatures cause growth to be slow.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:20):**  So we call that non-growing season because there is legal or no growth at all.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:25):**  So in holistic management, people usually classify seasons as rainy season and dry season,  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:31):**  but for us we have growing and non-growing because it is around management of your land  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:37):**  and also monitoring your ecosystem processes, how effective are they in this time of year  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:43):**  and what sort of management game you need to put up with your tool, whether you're using  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:48):**  shade, bison or cattle.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:52):**  So in the non-growing season here, things really get dry and brittle and grasses and  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:28:58):**  plant twigs literally break.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:00):**  So that means that biological decay slows down or sometimes it's not present at all.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:07):**  And so these grass plants need megafauna, which is we have buffalo, zebras that have  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:15):**  evolved with our grasslands, but then we thankfully have a tool of livestock to then with their  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:21):**  complicated stomachs to be able to process and help these grasses keep growing.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:27):**  So they will eat the grass or trample what they do not eat so that every time their wolves  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:32):**  are working the land to open up the grasses so that when it rains again, sunlight and  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:39):**  water, and then these grasses can start to shoot again.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:42):**  So in the non-brittle environment, I would say it's not prudent according to what we  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:48):**  are learning with the ecosystem processes and all the body of knowledge that is out  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:52):**  there, especially in holistic management, that you do not have to rest your land because  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:29:56):**  then the grass is oxidized and that's what causes deserts to advance.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:00):**  And if you over-trample again, that's over exposing your land to lots of animal impact,  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:07):**  you pulverize the soil, when it rains, you actually face lots of soil erosion.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:13):**  So there's lots of creativity in how the animals will move.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:16):**  We do not have fenced camps here, so people usually head, we actually go out with our  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:22):**  animals.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:23):**  So we are acting as those lions and hyenas that will then evolve with our large grazing  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:29):**  herbivores in the wild savanna.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:33):**  And so that's that mimicry that we are using and really thankful for all the body of knowledge  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:39):**  that Alan Savory has so worked hard in.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:42):**  We're learning from all the practitioners now, the body of knowledge is really increasing  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:46):**  and communal people here, tribal people, we know these things.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:50):**  And so it's lots of just reviving the dialogue and then actually getting going.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:56):**  So I hope that that responded.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:30:59):**  Yeah, fantastic.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:01):**  And again, to give a little bit more contrast to the difference in this management style  
**[0:31:06-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:06):**  of animal grazing to what many people consider conventional grazing methods, perhaps Sheila,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:14):**  would you like to talk about the contrast between those and the way that the landscape  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:19):**  tends to respond over time from either your own observations or reports from other practitioners?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:25):**  Sure, I'll talk about two, I guess, the most common.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:31):**  One we call set stock grazing or continuous grazing.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:36):**  And that's the most common way of grazing where I live in the UK.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:43):**  And all that means is that animals are put in low stock density for a long period of  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:51):**  time, and they're really self managing.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:31:54):**  And the consequences of set stock grazing typically are that some plants are overgrazed.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:02):**  And then when they get overgrazed, they often die.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:08):**  And then they get replaced by plants that are less desirable to the animals.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:14):**  And then some plants are over rested.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:17):**  And those become very undesirable to the animals as well.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:22):**  So you end up with a pasture that's quite undesirable and low performing.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:29):**  And it is also contributing to climate change.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:34):**  Because typically what will happen is a farmer will do several different things to try to  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:41):**  regenerate the capacity of that field.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:45):**  One is they'll apply nitrogen fertilizer, another might be they plow the field and reseed  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:51):**  the field.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:53):**  And both of those things are going to be contributing to climate change.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:32:57):**  The other kind of grazing then that's getting more common is what we call rotational grazing.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:06):**  And rotational grazing, there's many, many, many varieties of it, but it's a very simplified  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:13):**  and reductionist way of doing holistic planned grazing.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:19):**  And what's very, very, very common when people do that is they might have success in a good  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:26):**  year, but when they get to a bad year like this year, that's when they run into problems.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:32):**  So like Sarah's facing drought here in this part of the world, we're facing a very cold  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:38):**  spring where we had the driest April on record and now we've got like the wettest May on  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:44):**  record.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:45):**  And so the weather, and it's been cold through both, and so every farmer's run out of grass  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:51):**  here already in the spring.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:33:55):**  And lots of people with rotational grazing, they have grazed their entire farm and they  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:01):**  don't know what to do.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:04):**  And it's only May.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:06):**  And so with holistic management, what is different is we're managing the complexity and we're  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:14):**  monitoring every single day.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:17):**  So even though we made a plan, we use the feedback loop and we assume we're wrong.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:22):**  As Precious said, we have this humility, so we assume we're wrong and we monitor the grass  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:27):**  growth every day.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:30):**  And if it's wrong, if nature is doing different to what we planned, then we take controlling  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:38):**  action.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:39):**  You know, long before the whole farm runs out of grass, we would be able to take a controlling  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:44):**  action.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:45):**  And then if it's still going wrong, then we take, we completely replan.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:51):**  And we've got lots of examples where that's really enabled people to get out of a bad  
**[0:34:57-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:34:57):**  situation and just not get to the place that you get to with set stock grazing and rotational  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:05):**  grazing.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:06):**  Yeah, those complexities need to be adapted to.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:10):**  And it sounds like with the heavy emphasis on management and adaptation to what's happening  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:16):**  in the environment, it sets it apart from these others that are perhaps technique heavy,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:20):**  where there's a set playbook of how to run things.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:24):**  And it's not as flexible as this is.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:28):**  So Sarah, given the challenges that you're going through and also some of the perceptions  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:33):**  from people who don't know the intricacies of this and talk a lot about stocking rates,  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:40):**  and there's controversy over this.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:41):**  There's people who say that damaged lands need to have less animals and higher stocking  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:47):**  rates are going to contribute to desertification and degradation of soils or compaction.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:52):**  Can you give some, I guess, more nuance into that conversation so we can understand a better  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:35:58):**  picture of what's happening in the ecology itself?  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:01):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:05):**  So first, I think we see this a lot in the United States with federally owned lands and  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:10):**  leases when people, what we call BLM land, they have, I'm still familiar with this.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:16):**  So the government sets what they think should be the stocking rate.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:19):**  And then if you get the lease on that land, you are required to follow that stocking rate.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:25):**  However, it is getting better where by showing with the grazing plan and demonstrating on  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:30):**  other pieces of land what can be done, some of that is changing.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:34):**  But I think it goes back to what Sheila said about a paradigm shift in thinking that the  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:42):**  ruminant animals on the land are what is causing the problem.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:47):**  And the problem is not the amount of animals on the land.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:51):**  It's how those animals are being managed.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:36:53):**  And so with holistic planned grazing, we talk about getting the animals in the right place  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:00):**  at the right time with the right behavior.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:04):**  And so if you think about it with bison specifically, there were millions, millions of bison, you  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:10):**  know, roaming through our country in places that now you look at and there's thousands  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:16):**  of acres and there's, you know, 10 cows out there basically doing what Sheila was just  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:22):**  explaining.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:24):**  And it's obviously not working because the land is degrading quickly.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:29):**  So I think the timing, Precious talked about it too, is like that movement and with the  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:34):**  grazing plan and then the feedback loop, which Sheila was talking about.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:39):**  Like those are so key to knowing if your animals should still be there or not.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:43):**  Not necessarily the amount because if there's a lot, a lot of animals on there, but they're  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:47):**  there for a short amount of time, they're going to bite what they're supposed to bite.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:51):**  They're going to dung, urine, trample, and then they're going to go.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:37:54):**  And so it's about the timing of it more than it is about the quantity of animals.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:00):**  In a drought, you tend to slow things down because for various reasons, but the grazing  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:07):**  tends to slow down because recovery is taking longer and that recovery time is what's the  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:13):**  most important.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:15):**  I think it's also helpful to talk about overuse.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:22):**  So if an animal is biting a plant, and I'll just talk about this briefly, but you know,  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:26):**  so if an animal is biting a plant and that plant starts, this is roots and this is a  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:31):**  plant.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:32):**  So if that animal bite, bite, bite, bite, bites this plant, and then that plant starts  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:36):**  to regrow as it starts to regrow, if that animal comes back and bites it again, when  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:41):**  it started to regrow, that plant thinks, oh my gosh, I'm under attack.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:45):**  I better pull energy from my roots so I can keep growing.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:48):**  And then it gets, you know, starts going, gets bit again.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:50):**  I'm going to pour more energy from those roots.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:52):**  And eventually that plant gets pulled out because it's pulled so much energy out of  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:56):**  its roots, right?  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:38:57):**  Those root systems got shorter and shorter.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:00):**  That happens when what Sheila was talking about, there's set stocking rates and there's  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:05):**  partial rest.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:07):**  And so it's all about timing.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:08):**  If those animals have to stay there and it just gets bit, it gets bit again, gets bit  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:12):**  again, it gets bit again, it's getting really short, but it hasn't started to regrow at  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:16):**  any point.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:17):**  That's okay.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:18):**  You can leave and that plant will recover.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:21):**  But what happens is when the timing gets messed up or when there's so much space.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:27):**  So imagine if there was so much space and that in one pasture, in one area, and that  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:32):**  plant was bit and you know, two weeks later because nobody's moving those animals.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:37):**  So two weeks later, this animal's wandering around, this plant has started to regrow,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:41):**  come back and bite it again.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:43):**  And now we're in that cycle of having a negative effect on the land.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:47):**  And it's actually worse when the animals are just sitting there in a huge paddock or pasture  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:53):**  and can come back and bite things after they've started to regrow than it is if it's all smashed  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:39:58):**  into that paddock, everybody thinks it's bit and then moves on.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:02):**  I hope that makes sense.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:03):**  And those sort of complexities are what make the grazing planning chart so critical because  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:09):**  you can actually see, all right, this many animals are going to be in this size paddock  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:13):**  with this much forage.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:15):**  They're going to hit it like this and then we're going to move on.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:17):**  And then the feedback loop is actually going out there on the ground and seeing what's  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:21):**  happening.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:23):**  I know producers, holistic management practitioners who will say, you know, they try to get a  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:28):**  hoof print in like every square foot of pasture.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:31):**  They want an animal all over the place, fighting everything and then moving on.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:38):**  And then it's all a grand learning demonstration and experiment.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:42):**  There's all sorts of little experiments that are going on on my ranch where I hit it really  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:48):**  hard because I was trying to clear out some woody species, but did I hit it too hard and  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:53):**  now I'm going to cause capping and thistle is going to grow back or did I hit it just  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:40:57):**  right and now we're going to have perennial grass instead of thistle.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:00):**  And that's a continuous learning process, which is both exciting and sometimes nerve  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:08):**  racking.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:09):**  But I have a friend and mentor, Andrea Mollenberg, who says making mistakes is fun.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:13):**  Well, it seems like, first of all, there's a ton of variables that you have to account  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:18):**  for and you could probably never do that same experiment twice and certainly not in the  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:23):**  same spot.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:24):**  Right.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:25):**  And then on top of that, one of the benefits that I see from the Savory network is that  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:29):**  there is a large community of people who are sharing information, sharing experiences and  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:35):**  constantly comparing data and what's going on.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:37):**  So that kind of leads me to the criticisms of holistic management from various sides.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:44):**  There's backlash from people who think that there are downsides to the stocking rates  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:50):**  that we talked about.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:52):**  There are conflicting scientific studies.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:41:55):**  And I have seen defenses of this and I have seen criticisms.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:00):**  It seems like with the complexity that's being managed in all of these systems, you can see  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:05):**  them from multiple angles.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:07):**  And so I'm actually going to open it up to the three of you to kind of talk amongst yourselves  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:12):**  about what you've seen of these criticisms, how you would defend them, and at what point  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:16):**  do you take a critical look and make sure that you're not glossing over things and getting  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:23):**  into kind of a pedagogy or just kind of a blind adherence to a methodology that's worked  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:29):**  in the past.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:30):**  So I'll let the three of you discuss that from what you've seen and observed.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:34):**  Nobody wants to go first.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:36):**  I'm happy to start and then whoever likes to go next.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:42):**  First of all, I want to just say the criticisms are few.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:49):**  They're very tiny in number.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:52):**  And what it is, it's a worldview gap.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:55):**  That's what it is.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:42:57):**  And it's by and large coming from academia, academia who are practicing out of date thinking  
**[0:43:05-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:05):**  that they're the ones who are threatened by new ideas, because if they had to admit that  
**[0:43:13-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:13):**  they were wrong, then they have to admit that, you know, the last n years of teaching, they  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:21):**  were wrong.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:23):**  And I didn't really believe that that was the case until I encountered it face to face  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:30):**  in my own country.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:33):**  So I was told by many people, oh, you need to work with a university, you need to work  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:38):**  with the university if you want this to spread.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:40):**  So we did, we contacted many and none of them were interested.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:44):**  And finally, someone said, oh, you need to go to this one in Scotland, they'll be the  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:48):**  ones that will bite, they'll want it.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:52):**  So I looked up on the faculty and looked for the one who the faculty member who was already  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:43:58):**  thinking very holistically, and I had a two hour meeting with him, it was wonderful.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:04):**  He's loved everything I said, he said, Oh, I agree 100% with everything you're saying,  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:09):**  I said, Great, can you help us get holistic management into your university?  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:15):**  And immediately the conversation went negative.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:18):**  He said, No, I can't do that.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:20):**  And I said, and I just spent two hours in his office.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:24):**  I said, Why is that?  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:26):**  He said, Well, I'm five years away from retirement.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:31):**  And if I put my neck out and introduce this here, it's contradictory to everything that's  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:37):**  being taught at this university.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:40):**  It's very likely that I would lose my job, and I would lose my pension, and I can't afford  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:47):**  to do that.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:49):**  And then a few months later, we met somebody at our local university, and a young man,  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:44:58):**  and he was the head of agriculture.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:02):**  And he was very interested.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:04):**  And he said, Oh, come on over, I want to talk with you.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:07):**  We spent a couple hours talking with him.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:11):**  And again, we said, you're really interested.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:14):**  Would you like us to introduce holistic management in your university said, I can't, because  
**[0:45:22-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:22):**  I'm the breadwinner for my young family.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:25):**  And if I lose my job, my whole family doesn't eat.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:29):**  And I can't put my neck on the line.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:32):**  So that's what it's all about.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:34):**  It's individuals who feel threatened and can't change.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:39):**  Yeah, so I mean, I'd really love to appreciate Sheila's commentary.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:49):**  Because I think every time, sometimes on a platform like this, you go all out and really  
**[0:45:57-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:45:57):**  like express how, when we talk about holistic decision making, you're not making any other  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:05):**  work inferior, but you're also just bringing out the importance of management, and also  
**[0:46:12-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:12):**  really the importance of taking serious the issue of complexities and not assuming that  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:21):**  living systems and machines that will respond in a certain way when a certain tool or action  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:28):**  is used.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:29):**  And that whole school of thinking, after saying everything, I faced a certain situation where  
**[0:46:37-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:37):**  people from the academic world will just pick one thing, again, is it way just to confirm  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:45):**  out of context again, and just run with, oh, yeah, so you just said we should use this  
**[0:46:51-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:51):**  tool.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:52):**  Even if you try and really express that, I am by no means prescribing, because once I  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:46:58):**  prescribe, let's just cut it, it stops to be holistic.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:03):**  Because holistic really is about contextual relevance and what has caused an ecosystem,  
**[0:47:11-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:11):**  an organization to thrive that individual potential of that place, what causes the systems  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:18):**  to continue to evolve.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:19):**  But then the body of knowledge of reductionism is so strong right now in our societies.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:25):**  But thankfully, I think slowly, individuals are starting to get a head start and actually  
**[0:47:32-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:32):**  appreciate it.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:34):**  I always consider, I'm not a very deep scientist, but the simplest things that we've done, it  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:41):**  works.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:42):**  Sometimes that's all I have to say.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:44):**  There are lots of working examples.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:46):**  I have a friend in the US, her name is Beth.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:50):**  She had to let go of a list land, because she was using holistic plant grazing.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:47:55):**  So she was leasing land for many years to take care of the same number of animals that  
**[0:48:01-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:01):**  she has.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:02):**  But as her pasture improved, she let go of land that she was paying for.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:07):**  And she still takes care of her own animals with the same amount of number, but same type  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:13):**  of land and piece of land.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:15):**  So it's management that has improved the ecosystem processes and growth.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:20):**  And now she can take care of more animals, basically, in a sense.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:24):**  And you can't argue with those results.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:28):**  It's a lot of diligence of management.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:30):**  The issue is management.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:32):**  It's never the tool or the person, but our management approaches.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:39):**  So in that sense, I think it really shows us how, as a world, we continue to advance  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:46):**  in terms of technology.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:48):**  We've taken people to the moon.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:50):**  We're really advancing in that sense.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:52):**  But then if you look at the natural disasters, they are as huge as our successes in other  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:48:59):**  technological spheres.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:01):**  So that means you can almost see that there's a small disconnect in the fact that I think  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:07):**  as humans, we've evolved not to know what to do with things that self-organize.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:13):**  You know, when someone dies, it's not the end of life.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:15):**  You self-organize, you become manure, you feed the soil, and then you continue to live.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:20):**  So death is not the end, but there's continuous living.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:24):**  And so that's the same understanding that things that we manage and things that we make  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:29):**  are totally different in how they function and how we should handle them.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:34):**  So the criticisms will continue to be there.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:36):**  But I think the body of knowledge is also increasing.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:39):**  And thankfully, we're getting lots of researchers now getting interest.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:44):**  But sometimes academia won't accept holistic plant grazing.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:48):**  They'll accept all the other terms.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:51):**  So those are also semantics, again.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:54):**  But we're just hoping for...  
**[0:49:56-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:49:56):**  There's lots of hope and lots of excitement, which I think I'm choosing to really choose  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:02):**  at this point.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:04):**  So I feel like I'm taking off my rancher hat now.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:09):**  I'm putting back on my PR for a savory hat.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:13):**  But here's, I think, a huge crux of the challenge when it comes to the scientific community  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:19):**  and sort of scientific criticisms.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:24):**  Science in itself is reductionist.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:26):**  And that's not necessarily a bad thing.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:29):**  The scientific method is reductionist.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:32):**  And in order for something to be seen as proven scientifically, it needs to be replicable.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:39):**  We need to be able to say, this is what I did.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:42):**  And when I did it X amount of times, this is the results that I got.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:46):**  That's essentially how science works.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:48):**  That's how we test things.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:49):**  We have controls, how we can test hypothesis, et cetera.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:53):**  Super basic.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:55):**  But in essence, it needs to be replicable.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:50:59):**  We follow these steps.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:00):**  We got these results.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:01):**  Therefore, it is replicable.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:02):**  Then we can prove that it works.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:04):**  That tends to be how science works.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:07):**  Holistic management is a decision-making framework.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:10):**  Like Precious said, it is not a prescription.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:13):**  And you would not believe how many calls we would get even at the Savory Institute that  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:17):**  would say, I've got X amount of acres, X amount of hectares, X amount of animals.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:21):**  How many pastures should I have?  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:23):**  And how long should I keep them in each one?  
**[0:51:25-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:25):**  I have no idea.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:27):**  You know, I have no idea how much those pastures produce, what your animal's behavior is like,  
**[0:51:32-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:32):**  how much rainfall you got this spring.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:34):**  Like, I have no idea.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:35):**  There's so many decisions and complexity that goes into that answer.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:40):**  But what we want as humans tends to be a prescription like that.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:45):**  And if we could make it a prescription, then we could duplicate it, get the same results,  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:50):**  and say, check, it works scientifically.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:54):**  But sometimes when I hear like, oh, you know, we practiced holistic management, it didn't  
**[0:51:58-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:58):**  work.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:51:59):**  My next question is like, well, what exactly didn't work?  
**[0:52:03-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:03):**  Because this is a decision-making framework.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:06):**  So did the decision-making process not work?  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:10):**  Or did the process of making decisions work, but you got results that were different than  
**[0:52:15-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:15):**  what you were hoping for?  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:17):**  You know, what exactly didn't work?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:21):**  Because nothing about holistic management is do X, Y, and Z and get A, B, and C results.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:32):**  So that being said, there are lots of peer reviewed, et cetera, et cetera, scientific  
**[0:52:37-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:37):**  publications saying that if you manage livestock in a way, you know, that mimics ecosystems  
**[0:52:43-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:43):**  takes into consideration these different practices, we can get up to 40% more land productivity.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:49):**  That's been seen 30% more water retention.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:52):**  That's been seen that these things are possible by using this decision-making framework.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:52:59):**  So you know, and again, those were in specific contexts with all that complexity.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:07):**  And then I think I just, I feel like I really need to add that, you know, it is really contextually  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:14):**  relevant.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:15):**  So one of, and a lot of times I'll hear, well, that worked there, but it wouldn't work here.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:21):**  And that's a continual thing that's said literally around the world.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:25):**  All the way down to in my town, there's a amazing farm and ranch generational in-town  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:31):**  Durango that's been doing holistic management for 30 years, but they have 100% of their  
**[0:53:36-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:36):**  property is senior irrigation water rights.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:39):**  And so people where I live 15 miles away called the dry side say, well, they can do holistic  
**[0:53:44-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:44):**  management over there, but it wouldn't work out here because we don't have that same water.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:50):**  So what has been amazingly powerful is demonstrate local demonstration sites.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:54):**  So if I'm doing it here and it's working here, my neighbor next door, can't very well say  
**[0:53:58-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:53:58):**  that wouldn't work here.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:00):**  Right.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:01):**  But there is again, a pride and an ego.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:04):**  They don't usually come and say, I want help.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:07):**  They may become over and just kind of, you know, want to have dinner and kind of start  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:10):**  just asking some questions about what's going on over there that's making it look different.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:15):**  One of the biggest moments for me was actually when I was at Allen's ranch, where I first  
**[0:54:23-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:23):**  met Precious, the Africa center for holistic management.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:26):**  And we had toured that whole ranch and talked about what had been going on, et cetera.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:30):**  And then we went, I don't know how many miles away precious, like 15 miles away, maybe to  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:35):**  Hwange national park and holy smokes, same exact rainfall.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:42):**  Okay.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:43):**  But no grass anywhere.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:46):**  It looked like a desert, dry Creek beds, bare ground everywhere.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:50):**  And I mean, we're talking five foot tall grasses and, and clear running streams, 15 miles away  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:57):**  on Allen's ranch.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:54:58):**  The only thing that was different was the management.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:02):**  And for me that like black and white demonstration right next to each other blew my mind.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:09):**  And so I've now gotten to see that repeatedly in multiple contexts all over the world.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:15):**  But I think as far as changing people's minds, you know, I don't, I don't have any desire  
**[0:55:21-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:21):**  to fight the scientific community, you know because for me, it really has to do with a  
**[0:55:26-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:26):**  local level of people's livelihoods surviving what we can do to sequester carbon and fight  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:33):**  climate change.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:35):**  And that's going to happen whether or not there's a peer reviewed article that supports  
**[0:55:38-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:38):**  it or not, it's going to happen.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:41):**  And so we do, I use what's called ecological outcome verification.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:44):**  It is a scientific methodology looking at empirical data to prove carbon sequestration  
**[0:55:50-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:50):**  and regenerative results.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:51):**  So I do go all in on the hard science, but that does not equal holistic management, right?  
**[0:55:58-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:55:58):**  Because holistic management and even EOV are very agnostic to practices because it is a  
**[0:56:04-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:04):**  very contextually relevant tool.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:08):**  So I hope that answers, that's a very, I feel like messy question you asked, but hopefully  
**[0:56:13-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:13):**  that helps.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:14):**  Well, I was trying to see if you would trip yourselves up and identifying some of the  
**[0:56:21-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:21):**  criticisms and going back and forth with that.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:23):**  But everything that you've said really, I've seen it in many other aspects like Precious  
**[0:56:28-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:28):**  and I both work with ecosystem restoration camps and advising restoration plans for people  
**[0:56:35-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:35):**  who are new to this.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:36):**  And you get a lot of the same questions.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:39):**  What trees should I plant here?  
**[0:56:41-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:41):**  How should I implement key line design here?  
**[0:56:44-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:44):**  It's like, I don't know.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:46):**  Give me more information.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:47):**  What are you trying to achieve?  
**[0:56:49-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:49):**  And there's so many more questions to answer.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:51):**  And there's outcomes that are going to be totally different from one property to another  
**[0:56:56-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:56):**  or a different owner to another.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:56:58):**  And that is often missed in this reductionist mindset of trying to verify very specific  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:57:05):**  results and minimizing the amount of variables, which like you said, this is a paradigm that  
**[0:57:10-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:57:10):**  does not mesh with the natural world.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:57:12):**  Things don't play out so cleanly and so simply as we would want to be able to study the minute  
**[0:57:19-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:57:19):**  aspects of what it is we're trying to achieve.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:57:21):**  And that's really well said.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:57:29):**  So if you want to hear more from this panel and the questions that our listeners asked,

**[0:58:07-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:58:07):**  of the wonderful people who showed up to participate in the chat.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:58:11):**  Now as great as it is to include multiple experienced perspectives on this topic that  
**[0:58:14-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:58:14):**  we covered in the panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and viewpoints

**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:58:49):**  Now this week's question, which we'll be discussing on the forum, is, how do you currently manage  
**[0:58:54-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:58:54):**  your decisions and the complexity of your life and work?  
**[0:58:59-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:58:59):**  How well do the decision makers in your life understand the core values and motivations

**[0:59:07-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:59:07):**  Now though we live in a complicated world of artificial infrastructure and machines,  
**[0:59:11-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-broad-applications-of-the-holistic-management-framework-expert-panel-6/#t=0:59:11):**  most of us would say that the things which we value most come from the natural world,

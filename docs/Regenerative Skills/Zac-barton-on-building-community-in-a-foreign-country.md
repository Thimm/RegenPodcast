**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.

**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:18):**  experiences from the last five seasons of this podcast, just know that the best way  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:23):**  to take the next step and deepen your knowledge in order to apply the skills and learning  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:27):**  to regenerate your world is to read a book.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:31):**  New Society Publishers' vision is to provide the world with fundamental tools to help build  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:35):**  a just and ecologically sustainable society, and many of the guests that I've interviewed  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:40):**  here on the show are authors published by them.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:43):**  You can find all of their work in ebook, audiobook, and classic paperback at newsociety.org.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:49):**  Hey there everybody, and welcome back!  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:55):**  Now today is the last episode in this series on building community.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:00:59):**  Now though there remains so much that we could say about this topic, I wanted to wrap up  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:03):**  this endlessly complex and nuanced subject with a discussion about the challenges and  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:08):**  the learning of integrating into a foreign community.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:11):**  Now of course, I have a lot of my own thoughts and stories on this, but I also immediately  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:16):**  thought back to check in with a friend of mine who's been on this show before in a previous  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:20):**  series on homesteading, and who's had similar experiences which he's actually developed  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:25):**  much much further than I ever have.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:28):**  So Zach Barton is a permaculture designer, an activist, and a teacher who's been living  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:33):**  in Nepal since 2003.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:35):**  In 2005, he founded the Kamala Foundation, an organization committed to bringing the  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:41):**  principles of permaculture to life, and providing community-based programming to cultivate resilience  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:47):**  and revitalize traditional and ecological ways of being.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:51):**  He also established Almost Heaven Farms in 2013, where he researches, demonstrates, and  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:01:57):**  trains local farmers and international visitors in permaculture design, earth-based building,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:02):**  and ecological restoration.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:05):**  Specializing in program design and implementation, Zachary has worked in communities across Nepal,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:10):**  and was instrumental in co-founding the Resilience Through Recovery project, which employed permaculture  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:15):**  techniques to help villages to recover from the devastating earthquakes of 2015.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:21):**  He currently is working to develop a network of communities committed to regenerative development  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:25):**  across the Himalayan bio-region.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:28):**  Now in this conversation, Zach and I focused on our shared experiences working to integrate  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:32):**  ourselves into the foreign communities where we've settled.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:36):**  We talk about the challenges and even the hilarious failures that we've faced in the  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:40):**  process and many of the learnings that have come out of it.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:45):**  I work with many people who are moving to foreign parts of the world and are working  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:49):**  to establish land and community-based projects.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:53):**  For a lot of reasons, my guidance always centers around putting their efforts into personal  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:02:58):**  growth and the learning that is required to be a part of the culture and the social space  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:03):**  that they're hoping to live and work in.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:04):**  Now, Zach particularly is one of my favorite examples to point to of a Westerner who has  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:10):**  found an important place for himself where he lives that he's cultivating through humility,  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:15):**  deep listening, patience, and a priority on respect for the people around him.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:21):**  Now this turned into a really fun conversation with admissions on both of our parts of embarrassing  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:26):**  learning curves as well as honest admissions of the fact that we're both still very much  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:30):**  growing and evolving in this space.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:33):**  And before we get started, I do want to apologize for the mediocrity of some of the audio quality.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:39):**  Just like my personal struggles in the early days of this show when we were recording back  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:42):**  in the shack in the middle of the mountains in Guatemala, Zach is also just coming out  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:47):**  of the monsoon rains in his rural community in the mountains.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:49):**  So you'll have to bear with us in a few spots, but I cleaned things up as best I could.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:54):**  And anyway, with that out of the way, I'll hand things over now to Zach Barton.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:03:58):**  Zach, first of all, awesome to speak to you again.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:03):**  I know we've been in touch a little bit over the Discord channel that you've been on for  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:07):**  a long time, and I've been following your work on the different articles that you post.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:11):**  I love your writing and such, but this is the first time that we've actually gotten  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:14):**  to talk again since the last interview.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:17):**  I'm really excited to hear what's new, what's happening at your homestead, what's happening  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:22):**  in the foundation.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:23):**  Give me a little update.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:24):**  Yeah, great, Oliver.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:25):**  Great to be back.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:26):**  Same thing.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:27):**  I've been following you really closely since our first conversation.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:34):**  Really impressed with the work that's going on.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:37):**  Really inspiring.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:38):**  I'm picking up new regenerative skills and knowledge and even connections.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:45):**  So thanks for that.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:47):**  You put me on to Graham Sait, also who I got to have a two hour conversation with actually,  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:04:55):**  and just really helped me with the bio fertilizer development and the plant nutrition.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:01):**  So the nutrition farming, all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:04):**  I've just been soaking up everything that you're putting out there.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:07):**  So thanks.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:08):**  Amazing.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:09):**  I'm so glad to hear that connection.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:10):**  Yeah, that guy is a wealth of knowledge.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:13):**  Oh, man, it's crazy.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:15):**  Well, pretty much everybody that you interview is really just on the forefront of their fields  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:22):**  and really amazing connections you've made.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:26):**  So thanks for passing all that stuff on.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:29):**  And that kind of leads into what we've been doing.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:34):**  So on the farming side of it and the homesteading side of it, I mean, that's always going on.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:43):**  And farm gets better and better every year.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:46):**  We actually added a third farm.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:49):**  So our farms aren't only farms, they're centers.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:05:54):**  So we do a lot of different things, different activities besides just running our own farm,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:01):**  running our own farm is a big part of it, of course.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:03):**  And that's the important thing for us is to have that fully functional operating farms  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:09):**  as part of our resilience strategy for own lives and our own family.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:14):**  But every farm is also a center.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:17):**  So up here in the mid hillside, at almost seven farms, so that's a full fledged permaculture  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:23):**  education and training center.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:27):**  And then we have our first farm, which is an organic, it's organic rice production and  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:34):**  food forestry that's down south, that's in the subtropical area of Nepal, so southern  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:40):**  part of Nepal.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:42):**  And then we just established our third center.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:45):**  And this is a quite a bit higher in the in the hillside.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:48):**  So it's at 2500 meters.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:50):**  So that's about 8000 feet.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:55):**  And that's a woman's led agroecology center.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:06:59):**  So another farm, but the center's activity will be as a base for women's groups and developing  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:06):**  agroecology, being led by by different women and different women's groups.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:11):**  So adding another farm on to the plate has, has kept me busy over the last half of a year.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:20):**  And yeah, everything's going good.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:22):**  I mean, the soil is getting better, diversity is growing all the time.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:29):**  We've been playing around with different crops, new crops, you know, perfecting our management  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:35):**  practices on other crops.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:37):**  I've been really pushing our farms to move more into no dig.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:41):**  I mean, we don't call it no till because we don't till here we dig with, with tools because  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:46):**  we're on a hillside so we don't even plow.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:49):**  But yeah, no dig systems, more cover crop systems, a lot of mulching.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:07:55):**  So getting heavy into into mulched raised beds, you know, and then perennial more and  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:01):**  more perennial systems.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:02):**  So we've also started a fruit and nut tree seedling nursery on at almost seven farms.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:10):**  And that's the plant out on our three farms as well as to provide as a resource to different  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:17):**  communities, different farmers, organizations, even local government to promote this idea  
**[0:08:24-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:24):**  of fruits and nuts as, as a perennial cropping system, which is more resilient and also kind  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:31):**  of appropriate.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:32):**  So appropriate varieties and appropriate trees for this area.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:37):**  So yeah, all that kind of stuff just keeps going on trees keep growing, getting bigger,  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:43):**  we have more firewood, we have more bamboo, the soil is improving everything just just  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:49):**  kind of keeps growing.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:50):**  Incredible.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:51):**  I can imagine this is with all these moving parts, you've got a lot on your plate.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:08:56):**  And it must be a time management and an organization challenge as much as anything to do with the  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:01):**  ecology.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:02):**  How have you found to manage that?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:04):**  Is it you're getting to the point where you have to delegate a lot of tasks?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:07):**  Or are you still trying to take on most of it yourself?  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:10):**  No, no, you nailed it, man.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:12):**  I'm, I'm working on my delegation capacity, let's say so.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:18):**  And there's a couple pieces to that, right.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:20):**  So one is being able to transition from micromanagement to macromanagement.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:29):**  And I think you know very well that when you're very hands on person, you know, you like to  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:34):**  be the one right in the ground and getting your hands dirty.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:37):**  And it's hard for you to let go of some of the elements of the farm or the business or  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:44):**  the organization.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:45):**  So that is more of a kind of a mental break, you got to be able to handle.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:52):**  And then it's also about developing people.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:09:54):**  So a lot of my work is developing people that I can hand responsibility to.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:00):**  So I work with a lot of young people.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:02):**  I mean, Nepal has a very young demograph.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:06):**  So it's a very young population.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:09):**  A lot of I mean, I'm working with people from 16 years old, even which I'm trying to train  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:15):**  and help them build the capacity to at least take over small projects, you know, a one  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:20):**  week project or a small piece of the of the farming system and stuff like that.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:25):**  So yeah, delegation has been a big part of my life the last the last half a year, a year  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:33):**  for sure.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:34):**  It's one of the things that I like about connecting with you is that we've often had so many similar  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:38):**  experiences.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:40):**  And I know we both got into this because we love to work on the ground.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:43):**  Like for me, it was a lot of natural building for you was the farming stuff.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:46):**  And there's been a lot of overlaps in that.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:48):**  But you definitely get to a point where your time is not best used, you know, working in  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:53):**  the fields or mixing mud to put on the walls.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:10:57):**  It's rather you start to move into an educational and a mentorship role, and then managing the  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:02):**  teams and the newly capacitated people who can go out and start to develop their skills.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:08):**  And I don't know about you, but I've always kind of struggled with that dynamic, like  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:11):**  realizing that it's necessary, while also balancing the fact that those were not my  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:15):**  motivations for getting into this line of work at the same time.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:19):**  But I guess wearing the necessary hats as those things are called for.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:25):**  Have you balanced that?  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:26):**  Well, I think that's it is like, how do you balance it?  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:31):**  And I mean, I will never leave actually doing farming myself, because it just brings me  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:37):**  too much too much joy.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:40):**  You know, it's my exercise.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:42):**  It's the way I keep my body fit and keep my health up.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:47):**  So like, I don't, I think that balance, I guess it's kind of looking like maybe 5050.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:52):**  Right now, like, I still want to be and I think I need to still keep my feet on the  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:11:58):**  ground and have my hands in the soil and stuff because that's going to keep me centered.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:04):**  And it's just so important in this field of work also, like, I mean, how can you work  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:08):**  in agriculture and just sit in an office the whole time?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:11):**  I mean, I know people can and there's different roles that people play.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:14):**  But I mean, I want to have that hands on daily experience.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:19):**  So I think right now it's like, yeah, 5050.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:22):**  And then slowly stepping back, empowering people, enabling people to do that work.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:28):**  Let's see.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:29):**  I mean, it's also a process.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:30):**  And it's funny, Oliver, because there's also a pull, you know, where I am being pulled  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:37):**  to manage things more and being pulled to spend more time developing relationships,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:43):**  you know, with government bodies, other organizations, other businesses.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:46):**  So sometimes life is not about your choice and what you want either, it's kind of about,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:53):**  you know, what's needed to be done.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:55):**  And I guess that knowing that it's needed to be done and that there's going to be even  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:12:59):**  greater impacts, I guess I'm finding myself being a little bit more flexible on letting  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:05):**  go some of those grassroots activities that I like to be involved with.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:10):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:11):**  I think you put it really well there, Zach.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:14):**  Like there is a sense of duty in this as well.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:17):**  Right.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:19):**  Certain things are are calling us to step into because perhaps nobody else is either  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:24):**  able or willing to do them.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:26):**  And that's often how I kind of find peace in that even when I'm not finding the balance  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:32):**  that I would ideally like is, you know, this is the work that needs to get done right now.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:37):**  And either I'm uniquely suited to do it or there's just nobody else stepping up at the  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:43):**  moment and I don't know, being able to contribute in that way so that things don't stagnate  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:48):**  or start to move backwards is also quite, I don't know about fulfilling all the time.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:55):**  There's always a give and take.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:13:58):**  But but it is necessary.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:00):**  And hopefully, you know, we work towards finding better balance over the long run and making  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:05):**  sure that we don't lose our connection to the land in the process.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:09):**  Right.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:10):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:11):**  And I think, you know.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:15):**  Very well, that in this life, there's there's that you have to manage and we're not we're  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:20):**  not just talking about the complexity of a natural ecosystem, we're talking about the  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:24):**  complexity of businesses, corporations, having to work with governments, you know, having  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:30):**  to be able to communicate between all the stakeholders in a movement or in a project  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:35):**  where it's yeah, I guess a lot of that responsibility just falls on your plate.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:41):**  Because there isn't enough people with with that diversity of skills and capacities to  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:49):**  be able to do it.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:50):**  So what to do and like you said, I mean, I think we know the time is now to do all of  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:56):**  this work.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:57):**  I mean, there's no there's no point sitting around for another five, 10 years.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:14:59):**  So if the calling is there, I mean, we go after it.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:02):**  And I'm I guess I'm pretty much willing to do whatever I need right now to make this  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:08):**  continue to move forward.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:09):**  Right.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:11):**  I'm sure you understand as well.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:13):**  Well, so this is actually what I really want to explore with you in this conversation is  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:18):**  the community dynamics that especially people like ourselves, we're both living in countries  
**[0:15:23-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:23):**  that we are foreign to need to navigate in the concepts of cultural assimilation, understanding  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:32):**  your role in a place that's been established and has its own dynamics long before you came  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:38):**  here, in order to, I guess, cultivate the awareness and the observation necessary to  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:44):**  play an important role, but without bringing, let's say your own cultural baggage and perhaps  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:50):**  colonial mindset, which I know it's taken me a long time to work through and have, you  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:15:56):**  know, I continue to navigate in these different places like we're, we're, we're coming up  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:02):**  against a lot of other barriers that people who understand their culture are from the  
**[0:16:06-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:06):**  places that they're working in don't necessarily have to tiptoe around the way that we have.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:15):**  What have been some of your biggest learnings and well, you've got more than a decade in  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:19):**  Nepal now and integrating into that community and finding your place, your niche in how  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:26):**  you can affect change in a way that takes into account the nuances of the culture that  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:32):**  you're working in?  
**[0:16:34-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:34):**  Yeah, I guess it's, it's, it's an ongoing process of establishing your role in your  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:46):**  community. And I don't think it's ever necessarily fixed. And I think it's like we're just talking  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:53):**  about my life is changing now because of the demands of this work. And I'm being forced  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:16:59):**  to put on different hats, which I never had on, had to wear before. So I think I've what  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:05):**  I've always been good at. And again, like in our last conversation, we talked about  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:10):**  how easy it is as a foreigner to be in Nepal because of the culture here and because they  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:16):**  haven't been colonized. And I mean, all of those, those really great things, the diversity  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:21):**  of linguistic groups, ethnic groups, religions, everything in Nepal, there's already quite  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:26):**  a bit of diversity. So I just kind of somehow sometimes feel like I'm just, you know, another  
**[0:17:31-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:31):**  drop in that, that soup. But I think for me, it's always been just trying to be as open  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:42):**  to people here, empowering people to guide processes, because the look, I mean, it's  
**[0:17:48-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:48):**  not difficult to work in a foreign country, if you're open to what people think, and they're  
**[0:17:56-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:17:56):**  ways of knowing and seeing and doing. And just embrace, I don't have a, what would I  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:06):**  call it, like a specific strategy or a way of doing things which I've held on to, it's  
**[0:18:12-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:12):**  it's just grown. It's been influenced by my own experiences. And yes, my background and  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:22):**  stuff like that, it plays a part of that. But now, yeah, almost 19 years in Nepal, my  
**[0:18:29-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:29):**  when I was in university, one of my friends, she would call me a chameleon. And it's because  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:36):**  just kind of whatever, you know, whoever's around me in whatever situation I'm, I'm in,  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:41):**  and I don't know, have you ever come across Bill Mollison's concept of the translator?  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:46):**  He wrote about this in the in the designers manual.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:48):**  Yeah, it's been a while since I read back on that refresh my memory. Well, it's just  
**[0:18:53-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:18:53):**  it's very much about, you know, the the principle of valuing the edge or valuing the marginal  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:02):**  spaces. Like we talked about, you know, the the edge of a pond is actually, you know,  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:09):**  it's it's two elements, it's a water element and a land element, and it incorporates both  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:15):**  the characteristics of those of those two elements. So he also used it to explain people  
**[0:19:20-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:20):**  and I believe he probably saw himself as this kind of translator. But it's someone who's  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:29):**  on both sides, you know, so I am a foreigner, and I look like a foreigner and I came from  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:35):**  Canada. And even after 19 years, I still have a funny accent when I speak Nepali. But I'm  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:42):**  not I'm not fully a foreigner, because I'm very much Nepali and I live in a rural area.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:48):**  And I am farming and stuff like that. So I think that puts me you know, as a translator  
**[0:19:54-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:19:54):**  between those two worlds are those two spaces. So I'm very good at explaining Nepal to foreign  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:02):**  people. And I'm very good at translating the intricacies of the foreign world and the western  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:09):**  world and concepts and stuff like that into two Nepali communities. So I guess I guess  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:15):**  that's how I see my role in the community. To loop back to what you actually asked is,  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:23):**  I mean, translating between these two worlds translating, you know, even pulling resources,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:29):**  sharing resources between the two worlds. It's kind of the role that I've something  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:38):**  I'm good at, and then something that I think I've found purpose in and that I've been able  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:43):**  to bring something to the community here and the community back in Canada also.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:48):**  That's amazing. That's an ability that I have a lot of reverence for. I've seen other people  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:53):**  do it effectively in a lot of places where I've worked. And it is such an essential skill,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:20:59):**  especially in the modern world, when cultures are intermingling constantly. And there's  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:04):**  a lot of possibility. And I've seen plenty of examples of where miscommunication can  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:09):**  cause a lot of stress and break processes down from from yeah, from just that lack of  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:16):**  understanding. And there's few people who have the type of, you know, nearly 20 years  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:21):**  of experience in a place speaking the language, living with the people regularly. But also,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:27):**  you know, the background that you have from Canada and the western world, and the contrast  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:32):**  in between those being able to effectively communicate them between the communities is  
**[0:21:36-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:36):**  I really respect people who take on that role. And with that, what have been some of perhaps  
**[0:21:44-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:44):**  the disciplines or the cultivations that you have managed to leverage for more effective  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:51):**  communication or better integration into that community?  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:21:55):**  Cool. That's, that's a great question. Oliver, I don't know, I don't know, man, I don't know  
**[0:22:00-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:00):**  how to. It's been so organic and unconscious, that I don't even I don't even know if I could  
**[0:22:09-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:09):**  say like, I've ever put a conscious effort into cultivating any specific skill. I don't  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:19):**  I don't know, like, well, okay, well, what's been your experience? What what kind of skills  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:24):**  have you cultivated as you've worked in different communities around the world?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:28):**  And skills is tricky, because I think they're pretty unique to individuals, right? Like,  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:34):**  if I were to recommend certain skills or things that came easily to me, they may not be the  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:38):**  ones that work for others. But the reason why I asked that question was because I've  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:42):**  found disciplines and practices to kind of be those things that fill in the gaps. So  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:47):**  one of the obvious ones, of course, is making the effort to speak the local language. There's  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:52):**  always going to be a barrier that you're not going to get past, and that people are not  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:22:58):**  going to be able to welcome you into aspects of society if you don't understand the local  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:02):**  language. For me, first, it was learning Spanish in Latin America, but of course, that's the  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:07):**  colonial language. And then so though I never got to a level of proficiency, and just a  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:12):**  couple of years that I was in Guatemala, working on at least greetings, common phrases, and  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:18):**  pleasantries in Kaqchikel, and the community there in Sununna, where we're doing that homesteading  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:25):**  project, even those small efforts, even though I couldn't understand full conversations,  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:31):**  but got to a point of, you know, being able to at least show a sign of respect, because  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:35):**  nobody there from the foreign community, or very, very few people make the effort of actually  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:41):**  learning Kaqchikel. It is such a regional and small language, you can barely even travel  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:46):**  with it within Guatemala. And on the other side of that lake, they spoke Tzudu'il. So,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:52):**  you know, you really have to make an effort and say, okay, I'm going to take time and  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:23:55):**  show reverence for the culture of where I am, because it's not otherwise very practical  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:01):**  if you leave. And it made a big difference, the way that people treated me, even just  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:05):**  with that simple vocabulary and ability and phrases was really big. It's something that  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:11):**  I learned from my sister when I first traveled to Morocco. And I studied for a long time  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:16):**  to get by in French, because I knew the learning curve would be more manageable. But when my  
**[0:24:20-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:20):**  sister taught me a few phrases and words in Darija, which is their local, colloquial variety  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:29):**  of Arabic, it completely transformed the relationships that I was able to make with people, even  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:35):**  in small and, you know, not very deep interactions. And so now I'm in that process of learning  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:41):**  Catalan. I speak Spanish just fine. And I don't struggle to communicate with people  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:46):**  around here. But there's a very big difference in how people relate and communicate with  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:51):**  you if you make the effort to speak to them in Catalan. The state government here has  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:24:57):**  done a fantastic job about promoting the local language and making sure that it doesn't die  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:02):**  off because it's only spoken in a small region on the eastern side of Spain. And just like  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:09):**  everywhere else where, you know, small cultural aspects and traditions are lost and small  
**[0:25:15-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:15):**  languages are lost constantly, I feel a sense of, well, obligation, but like duty as a citizen  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:23):**  of this area, someone who's putting down roots here to learn to communicate in the way that  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:29):**  that is part of the history here. But anyway, that's just one aspect. And the rest is going  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:36):**  out and making an effort even when it's difficult. That closely relates to the language, but  
**[0:25:41-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:41):**  there's a lot of things that maybe I have even initial apprehension towards because  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:49):**  of my personality. And like, I'm not super social, I don't tend to go out into big groups,  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:53):**  but there's a lot of functions. There's a lot of traditions and festivals and things  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:25:56):**  around here that reinforce the cultural history of this place. And my partner and I try and  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:01):**  make an effort to participate in those, to understand how local politics work. And all  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:07):**  of these other things that you take for granted when you grew up in a place and they've just  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:12):**  always been around you, but there are differences in how they work. And if you don't make an  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:16):**  effort that it's not just knowledge that comes to you without doing a little investigation  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:23):**  yourself, at least that's what I've found. Do you make an effort to do those things like  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:29):**  with a real strategy in the beginning or is it something that just sort of evolved as  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:32):**  you spent time there?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:33):**  Yeah, well, I mean, when I talk about that, a lot of it happened organically. I guess  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:39):**  I would say that because I was doing things because I wanted to and like I wanted to learn,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:44):**  I wanted to learn the language. I wanted to be able to understand what the, you know,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:49):**  the old man sitting on the side of the road smoking a chillum, you know, what he was talking  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:53):**  about. And when you're up in the mountains, you know, high up in the mountains and it's  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:26:58):**  snowing and you know that people are talking about a language as first is language 100%  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:04):**  the most important. If you do not understand what people are saying or if they're forced  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:11):**  to communicate in English, you know, to make you understand that's not even fair and you're  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:16):**  not getting, you're not going to understand. You're not going to get the full meaning of  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:21):**  what's in their heart and stuff like that. And then as well as I mean, how do you explain,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:27):**  how do you communicate yourself to them if you can't say it in words and in a dialogue  
**[0:27:32-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:32):**  that they understand? So language 100% and I would even say this, like in South Asia  
**[0:27:39-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:39):**  here and like specifically in Nepal, if you don't speak the local language, people are  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:48):**  going to cheat you like right, left and center, you know, and it's like, it's like and I know  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:55):**  that people, especially tourists, they don't really don't like that and they don't understand  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:27:59):**  that culture. Like everything should be a fixed price and on a price tag and you pay  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:03):**  exactly what is there and not one rupee more or less. But that's not how it works in all  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:08):**  cultures and here it's like if you cannot communicate to that person why they shouldn't  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:15):**  cheat you and why they should give you the proper price and have that dialogue and it's  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:20):**  a game, right? If you don't play those kind of games and understand that part of the culture  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:24):**  and stuff like that, then that's just what happens and a lot of foreign people, they  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:30):**  get their asses handed to them on a plate, you know, when they're trying to do business  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:33):**  or something here and it's because they, I mean, I like that word effort that you use  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:38):**  even if you don't speak the language perfectly, the fact that you're trying to use their words  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:44):**  and their concepts and you understand that there's a culture behind everything you do,  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:50):**  even buying a cup of tea on the side of the road, then yeah, and it's not because you're  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:28:56):**  a foreigner, they do it to each other also, right? If there's somebody that wants a cup  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:02):**  of tea and they don't have time and they're just like, what's the price? Okay, and they  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:05):**  just want to pay whatever it is because they got run, they'll get cheated also. There's  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:08):**  a culture behind it all and taking the time and effort to engage in that culture, to understand  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:13):**  the language, yeah, 100% that's so fundamental to be able to make it here for sure.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:19):**  And did you struggle like I have done in so many places to get over your preconceived  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:24):**  notions about what is right and wrong and the way to interact with people? Like, man,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:29):**  I had so much baggage and like I grew up in Japan, I traveled a lot as a kid, I think  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:36):**  I was a lot more open-minded than the average person who hasn't really moved around and  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:40):**  I still ended up like just clashing a lot with things that came from my own preconceived  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:46):**  notions that I had to get over.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:51):**  Oh, for sure, for sure, Oliver. Like the concept of truth or the concept of reality, you know,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:29:59):**  like that's something so fixed, my Canadian brain, you know, like there is one truth,  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:04):**  there is what's right and what's wrong and there's no gray space in the middle. That  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:11):**  took a while and it still does sometimes, you know, and even having a conversation,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:17):**  Nepali is, it's an oral tradition, right? Like they're just, people are just getting  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:21):**  literate now where people are reading and writing. You have a whole generation where  
**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:27):**  like 80% of the people were illiterate. So the way of communicating was, you know, by  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:34):**  telling stories. Also people living in the village, they didn't have a TV, there was  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:38):**  no roads, there was no electricity. I mean, your entertainment was getting drunk and telling  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:46):**  stories, you know, and or getting drunk and listening to other people's stories. That  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:50):**  was like the life for generations. So, and then when you have that kind of oral tradition  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:30:55):**  and when you have that storytelling tradition, reality becomes what you make it, right? Reality  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:02):**  becomes a story that you tell over and over and over and the more times you tell it, you  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:07):**  know, that's when people start to believe and that's when something becomes real and  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:12):**  even can become a truth. Whereas for us, it's like, okay, well I'm going to Google that.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:18):**  No, that's not correct. You know, I'm going to Google that. And like, it's not whether  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:23):**  it's 100% true or not. I'm telling a story. I'm engaging with you. We're sharing a moment  
**[0:31:29-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:29):**  together and I find it really beautiful. But I find it, I still find it challenging sometimes,  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:38):**  especially when it comes to maybe the negative side of cultures. I mean, every traditional  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:43):**  culture has really beautiful things in it, but there's also some negative things in it.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:48):**  So sometimes when stories kind of, you know, perpetuate things which are negative for women  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:31:55):**  or for other ethnic groups or, you know, maintain that high caste, low caste system and stuff  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:01):**  like that, but it's just, it is what it is, right?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:05):**  Ah, Zach, I really liked that you brought that up because that was actually the harder  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:08):**  thing for me. Like, sure, you have judgments coming from where you come from, but then  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:13):**  the harder thing for me to actually unpack was the romanticism that I have for other  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:18):**  places and this kind of uneducated reverence or assumptions for how they relate to the  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:25):**  natural world, how they relate to one another. And by projecting that onto them, I would  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:31):**  end up disappointed when you realize completely that they're just people like you and anybody  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:37):**  else and they have the same struggles, they have the same communication issues, the same  
**[0:32:43-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:43):**  family fights and, you know, like. Being able to get past the romanticism and see people  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:51):**  for who they are and the reality of their situation, regardless of whether they had  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:32:56):**  access to the same information or resources as you. That was really a learning journey  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:02):**  for me and continues to be. I mean, it's it's a little easier here in Spain, where the culture  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:07):**  is not so drastically different from where I grew up, but certainly in the little Mayan  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:11):**  villages where I lived or in Senegal, where I worked in Ecuador and such, where the contrasts  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:16):**  are much bigger and you can project a lot of what you think people who live more simply  
**[0:33:23-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:23):**  are, you know, perhaps a little more moral or ethical based on. I don't really know what.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:31):**  Yeah, and the longer you stay a play, the longer you stay in one place, you know, the  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:39):**  more you understand that, yeah, people are just people actually, you know, and our clothes  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:43):**  are different, our languages are different, but we all have those positive and negative  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:48):**  things about us. And yeah, and I mean, I think I guess another thing which is really useful  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:55):**  and maybe has allowed me to be successful here is just being able to accept all of that  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:33:59):**  also. Right. Like that's just how it is. And that disappointment is because of our own  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:34:07):**  expectations, not because of what the reality actually is. So that's another thing. What  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:34:15):**  have been some of the most important learnings in the last 19 years? What are the same things  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:34:21):**  that you just got like spectacularly wrong and really had to learn from quickly? I know  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:34:27):**  I've got a lot of those. Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, I could probably fill up,  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:34:33):**  you know, your next 10 podcasts with all the mistakes I've made and how many times I got  
**[0:34:39-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:34:39):**  kicked in my ass by life. Yeah, um, yeah, I think one thing is, and especially in a  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:34:48):**  country like Nepal, things move a lot slower. There's a different concept of time, like  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:34:54):**  we call it in a poly time. Yeah, this means you're at least 15 minutes to three hours  
**[0:35:00-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:00):**  late for a meeting or whatever, a party. But yeah, I guess being overly ambitious, especially  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:11):**  with time, like wanting to have things get done. And you know, especially these days,  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:15):**  when I look at the situation in the world, and you know, it's important for us to get  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:21):**  certain systems into place, because that's going to make us more resilient, we need to  
**[0:35:25-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:25):**  do this, we need, I mean, we know all the things we need to do, and then trying to rush  
**[0:35:28-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:28):**  to get things done. That's caused me to make a lot of mistakes. And I think probably my  
**[0:35:37-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:37):**  biggest learning Oliver has been patience, really, and accepting that things don't work  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:44):**  how I want them to work. And they're not going to happen at the pace that I want them to.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:50):**  And I guess when I was younger, that was very frustrating. And I think I made a lot of mistakes  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:35:57):**  because I was trying to go too fast. I mean, you cannot, you can actually not go faster  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:02):**  than the speed of everything around you, even if you think you can maybe like you just can't  
**[0:36:07-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:07):**  because everything's so interconnected. That, you know, you can think you're moving forward  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:14):**  for a short period of time, but then you're going to hit your smack your face up against  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:18):**  that brick wall, right? And it's going to bring you back to the reality that things  
**[0:36:22-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:22):**  have to move at the speed of everything around you. So I think once I was able to recalibrate  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:31):**  my my speedometer to to be going at, you know, the local speed, and what Nepali people are  
**[0:36:38-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:38):**  comfortable with, that made me become a lot more efficient and a lot more successful.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:46):**  And I mean, that also involves changing your concept of time, because that's also a very,  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:53):**  I had a very Western idea of what time is. And like, I'm not I'm not Swiss, you know,  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:36:59):**  I'm not like with a nice big Swiss watch and, and checking every second. But I mean, definitely  
**[0:37:05-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:05):**  as Canadians, you know, you are very, you're very limited by time also, and time is a resource  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:12):**  which you never have enough of. Whereas in Nepal, we have a saying, it's just called  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:16):**  time pass. It's like, it's actually like, how do you pass the time by, you know, which  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:22):**  means you're doing something, it's speaking about boredom, right? Like, what do you do  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:25):**  when you're bored? And we're never bored in the Western world, because we don't have enough  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:30):**  time in the day to get things done that we want to get done. So how can we be bored.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:35):**  So that's been a big, big learning. And I think also helped me mature a lot by letting  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:43):**  go of those concepts of time and understanding that things will happen if they're meant to  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:48):**  happen. And they'll happen, you know, when it's time and when they're ready to happen.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:37:54):**  That's been big for me. Yeah. Yeah. What about you? Time is a huge one for me. And I'm probably  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:01):**  even closer to the Swiss scale than you are like, I always have this rod for this watch  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:06):**  on my wrist. I pride myself on being like militaristically punctual. It's for me very  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:13):**  closely connected to how I express respect for someone. Because it's such a resource  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:20):**  that I've been taught to see as limited, and one that you can't get back. It's one of the  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:26):**  ways that I choose to express my respect for other people is by respecting their time and  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:31):**  also demanding that people respect that of me. And I guess the thing that I would have  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:37):**  added on to that is the different ways that people show reverence and respect around the  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:42):**  world. That is often where I've found myself smacking my face into a cultural brick wall  
**[0:38:47-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:47):**  many times and really having lessons in humility. Many places where that has shown up most strongly  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:38:56):**  have been in the general rituals that have to happen to start a conversation or to start  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:02):**  a business interaction. Whereas I would go up and be like, all right, we're just going  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:07):**  to talk about this. We're going right to business. And they're like, what a rude, inconsiderate  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:12):**  thing to do, white boy, like, you haven't asked me about my family. You haven't talked  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:17):**  about what happened yesterday. There's this whole protocol of things that we talk about  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:22):**  before we get to business and business is incidental to this business conversation.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:28):**  It's much more important for us to get to know each other, to build a relationship.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:33):**  And that has caused me to audit and look further into like, what am I actually doing in these  
**[0:39:39-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:39):**  interactions and is getting work done more important than fortifying the relationship  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:46):**  or the connection that I have with this person or possibly even risking degrading it. Yeah,  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:52):**  that, I mean, so the concept of manners, the concept of respect in different places around  
**[0:39:58-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:39:58):**  the world are now something that I look a lot more into before starting to try and get  
**[0:40:05-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:05):**  things done and realizing that you could get something done and destroy a relationship  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:12):**  or connection with someone, which means that you're never going to get anything done with  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:16):**  them again. And is it really more important to complete a project or to create relation  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:22):**  lasting relationships with people that you are intricately dependent on, even in an indirect  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:28):**  way? So, you know, is the objective of this interaction really to advance a project or  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:34):**  is it to reinforce the trust and the respect that we have for one another? And is getting  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:41):**  a project done worth perhaps compromising that? It's something that I ask myself a lot  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:45):**  more when I interact with people from a cultural background that I am not familiar with. Yeah,  
**[0:40:50-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:40:50):**  well, and it's funny too, because I think as I get older and accumulate experience and  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:01):**  learn a little bit, maybe know a little bit more about how the world works, and it's really  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:05):**  a skill of successful people, isn't it Oliver? Like the relationship is ultimately what is  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:11):**  going to get stuff done. It is. It's not that activity that you have in your head that needs  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:16):**  to be done as soon as possible. It's actually, and I think probably if we look at the most  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:21):**  successful people we know in life, it's the people that take the time to develop those  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:25):**  relationships because those relationships are going to serve you forever, right? And  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:30):**  once you've developed a strong relationship, you're always going to have it. Yeah. Yeah.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:35):**  And this is why I see so much more success from people who actually live and work in  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:40):**  the places where they're trying to get things done is because by default you have to have  
**[0:41:44-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:44):**  that long-term mindset. Whereas NGOs or people who go in as much like myself, like I would  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:51):**  go in and say, okay, we're going to do a building project. I've got a client. And then from  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:41:56):**  there I'm going to go somewhere else. I didn't necessarily have skin in the game. And that  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:00):**  really colored my thinking and the approach that I had to those relationships. It was  
**[0:42:06-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:06):**  much more short-term than I would be proud to admit most of the time. And I'm much more  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:13):**  careful about getting closely involved with projects that I'm not going to be around for,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:20):**  especially in the maintenance phase. I have much more come in now at an advisory role  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:27):**  and work with them to find stakeholders whose lives are connected to the outcome of that  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:32):**  project. Not just ones who want to see development somewhere else so that they can wash their  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:36):**  conscience of something that they're destroying in their own place. And I try and say that  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:42):**  without judgment, but that's how a lot of these projects end up going. Mainly just because  
**[0:42:48-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:48):**  those relationships are essential to the longevity and the staying power of any initiative that  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:42:56):**  you're trying to get off the ground. And you know that much better than I do. You've lived  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:00):**  where you are for a very long time. How has that affected the development of all of the  
**[0:43:05-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:05):**  different projects that the Kamala Foundation has helped to develop? Well, I think that's  
**[0:43:13-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:13):**  key. And you know the organization, when we talk about the Kamala Foundation, it is a  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:22):**  Canadian registered charitable organization. We can give tax receipts. We're in good standing  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:28):**  with the Canadian revenue agency, all that kind of stuff. But the actual heart of the  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:32):**  Kamala Foundation is the people here doing the work in Nepal. And I think our board is  
**[0:43:38-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:38):**  really, really open about that. There's no idea like the Kamala Foundation is this group  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:48):**  of people in Canada. All we're doing is helping funnel resources from a place where there's  
**[0:43:54-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:43:54):**  maybe too much to a place where there's not enough. And at the same time, being just really  
**[0:44:03-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:03):**  amazed at what the community here in Nepal, the work that they've done, the results that  
**[0:44:11-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:11):**  they've got. And it's not even, you know, Oliver, I'm one small piece of the community.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:19):**  And it's the success of Kamala Foundation, which has been doing a lot of work with a  
**[0:44:24-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:24):**  very, very small budget for many, many years. That success is because that there's so many  
**[0:44:33-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:33):**  people here really working from their heart. We have a huge network. Like, I mean, I know  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:40):**  I got to get on the websites and be better about communicating everything we're doing.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:44):**  But like, I can't even like you would have to come here and meet the people and stay  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:49):**  on the farms and visit the villages that we're living and working on. Because I don't even  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:55):**  know, I like I don't know how to put that into a report or in one picture or even one  
**[0:44:59-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:44:59):**  video to be able to communicate. You know, it is really about this community that's been  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:06):**  developed that's still developing people being new people coming in all the time. More and  
**[0:45:12-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:12):**  more people being engaged. It's growing. So it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's that, that, I  
**[0:45:20-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:20):**  mean, community led, really human centric kind of working, which has made the Kamala  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:28):**  Foundation successful. And I mean, I feel proud that I've been a part of it. But I'm  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:34):**  also feeling really comfortable, Oliver, that like, I could die tomorrow. And this will  
**[0:45:39-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:39):**  keep going. And that really makes me feel happy, right? Because there was like a long  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:42):**  time when we started to like started tripping out on the whole, okay, we got to do sustainable  
**[0:45:47-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:47):**  development. And how do we make things sustainable? I mean, we've moved on beyond sustainability  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:53):**  now. But when I was on that trip, it was all like, oh, if I died, and who's going to do  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:45:57):**  this fundraising, and who's going to manage this, and whereas now, it's grown to a point  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:02):**  where I can like confidently say, I'm gone tomorrow, and things will keep going. So and  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:08):**  that really speaks to I think, the fact that we've invested, and that we see it as an investment,  
**[0:46:13-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:13):**  but we've invested in developing that community.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:16):**  Yeah, that's a remarkable thing about your work and your process that I have admired  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:21):**  since since we first started speaking is that that is often missing in especially international  
**[0:46:28-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:28):**  work in communities of lesser means. There's an ego aspect of, you know, we got to stay  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:35):**  here, we got to keep doing this work. Whereas if you have an exit strategy, you can hand  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:39):**  it over to the people who are, you know, hopefully benefiting from the initiative, but who are  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:45):**  also the ones who decide if this is going to continue to be a useful solution for them  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:50):**  as their community evolves and grows. And it seems like that's something that you've  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:46:54):**  done extremely successfully, to the point where, like you said, you're not an essential  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:00):**  element in it continuing. It must be really satisfying to know that, you know, you still  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:05):**  have things that you can contribute, and that your efforts are appreciated, but that these  
**[0:47:11-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:11):**  projects are meaningful enough that if that kind of input and your specific contributions  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:19):**  were no longer there, that this is still valued enough that people will continue to work without  
**[0:47:24-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:24):**  you. And I think having an exit strategy, when starting a project like that is one of  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:32):**  the ways that you can include that concept in from the beginning is something that I'm  
**[0:47:37-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:37):**  much more conscious of now, as I continue to do or facilitate projects in different  
**[0:47:44-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:44):**  places is how quickly can I get it to a point where I am not needed? Because if that takes  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:51):**  too long, I'm not doing my job well. This needs to be something that people value enough  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:47:57):**  on the ground who are involved with it, that they will continue to put an effort into it,  
**[0:48:02-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:02):**  even if that support from outside starts to go away. What have been some of the ways that  
**[0:48:10-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:10):**  you have, I guess, communicated with the community to make sure that what support is coming in  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:18):**  or what efforts are coming from your part is actually valued in something that they  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:22):**  want rather than something that is being kind of put on them through the concepts of what  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:27):**  development or what sustainability is from the Western world?  
**[0:48:31-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:31):**  Yeah, that's, I mean, that's a really fundamental question. I think, you know, when I put on  
**[0:48:40-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:40):**  my my designer's hat, it's really about designing a project. So and that means going through  
**[0:48:49-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:49):**  a proper design process, having an actual framework, whereas you know, Oliver, a lot  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:48:55):**  of the work out there is like people just get an idea in their head and get some funds.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:01):**  Boom, let's go implement it. Now, they haven't done a proper needs assessment, they haven't  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:05):**  consulted with the community, they haven't done any capacity building, they haven't developed  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:10):**  those relationships or that network yet. Just okay, I'm going to build a school here. Look  
**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:16):**  at these kids, there's no school, they got to walk for two hours to go to school every  
**[0:49:19-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:19):**  day. Okay, get some money, build a school, right? It's like typical international development.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:26):**  The big NGOs, the big, big, super big NGOs still do it even right, the big I NGOs, everybody's  
**[0:49:32-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:32):**  doing it. Sit in sit in Brussels, you know, or Geneva or wherever Berlin you get an idea  
**[0:49:39-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:39):**  the board, okay, we're going to take this much money, we're going to invest in Nepal  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:42):**  for this, this and this. Do they need it or not? Do they want it or not? Is it useful  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:47):**  or not? Is it going to be sustainable or not? So I mean, I think going through that whole  
**[0:49:52-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:49:52):**  design process, and including as many stakeholders and I mean, we use that word stakeholders  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:01):**  that can be governments that can be the local teachers, women's groups, farmers groups,  
**[0:50:06-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:06):**  you know, the actual, the actual recipients of your project, including them in that design  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:14):**  process from the earliest stage. So I like I mean, I do a lot. That's a lot of my consultancy  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:20):**  consultant consulting work is around program and project design, not so much around land  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:26):**  design, because that's not a big thing here in Nepal right now. And and I mean, the first  
**[0:50:32-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:32):**  stage, the first step in that, that project design is like going and meeting people, spending  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:39):**  time with them, talking to them, picking their brains, letting them tell us what you know,  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:44):**  and just letting them even guide that conversation, not having like a proper interview where I'm  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:50):**  asking specific questions, get specific answers that comes later. At the beginning, it's just  
**[0:50:55-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:50:55):**  um, it's just listening to them and connecting with them. And you learn a lot that way. But  
**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:02):**  even before that Oliver, and this is something which has just recently really changed for  
**[0:51:08-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:08):**  me in the last, let's say three, four years, is before I used to do a lot of work where  
**[0:51:13-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:13):**  I would go or an organization would go and approach a community or a village and want  
**[0:51:20-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:20):**  to help them. That's changed now where people invite me to come, the community comes to  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:27):**  search us out. It's changed the dynamic of the relationship. They hear, okay, we heard  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:32):**  that you've done this in this village, you guys are working in agro ecology, permaculture,  
**[0:51:37-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:37):**  we see you've done some woman led enterprises. Would you be willing to come talk to us about  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:43):**  that? Would you be willing to come give us a presentation on what you're doing? It could  
**[0:51:47-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:47):**  be a local government body that heard about it, but it's them inviting us in. And that's  
**[0:51:54-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:54):**  that changes the whole relationship that changes the whole game from the beginning. And that  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:51:59):**  is really key to us developing and executing successful projects now.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:04):**  Oh, that's beautiful. And it really goes to the heart of my developing understanding of  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:11):**  the difference in between the paradigms that we approach these things from. I'm not sure  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:15):**  if you're familiar with the work of Carol Sanford is one of my favorite people who's  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:19):**  articulated the various paradigms from which people work from. And there being a key difference  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:25):**  between the do good paradigm and the regenerative paradigm, the do good being you go in with  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:31):**  an agenda of what you want to improve. And the regenerative paradigm being one where  
**[0:52:38-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:38):**  you go in to observe and listen and take the time to understand the unique capacity or  
**[0:52:45-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:45):**  the potential for the whole that you would otherwise be managing or influencing, whether  
**[0:52:51-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:51):**  that's a family or a community or a water catchment or an ecosystem. And taking the  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:52:58):**  time to understand that unique capacity or potential that it has so that you can play  
**[0:53:02-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:53:02):**  a role in facilitating its development without a personal agenda of what you think it should  
**[0:53:12-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:53:12):**  be. And I'm still working myself to figure out exactly how to improve my skills in working  
**[0:53:19-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:53:19):**  from that direction. But being invited into a place is an amazing indication that there  
**[0:53:25-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:53:25):**  is a recognition of the efficacy of some of what you've done. And people see you as a  
**[0:53:31-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:53:31):**  potential facilitator for where they want to go. And that communication that conversation  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:53:37):**  can be opened from a welcoming point rather than an agenda point. Yeah, definitely. And  
**[0:53:43-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:53:43):**  I think changing that as the dynamic of that relationship changes. It's so much easier  
**[0:53:52-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:53:52):**  to implement and maintain projects because one, there's no false expectations. Like when  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:02):**  you do charity, I hate charity work. And I mean, we're technically a charitable organization,  
**[0:54:08-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:08):**  the government of Canada. Don't tell them I hate charity because we're a charitable organization.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:15):**  But just that idea of being a charity is like, I need to give something to you for free to  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:21):**  lift you up. And I mean, that's exactly what you said. We're going in there to find what  
**[0:54:26-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:26):**  are the unique points? Okay, what are the unique strengths of this community? What are  
**[0:54:37-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:37):**  the opportunities which they face? And then how do we invest in those points, right? To  
**[0:54:44-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:44):**  be able to empower them to take on the development work, right? So it's not even I'm even moving  
**[0:54:51-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:51):**  away from like executing and implementing projects now, right? Because I think if the  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:54:57):**  design is done properly, and if we are having it community led, if we're having it community  
**[0:55:03-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:03):**  sent, having it be community centered, if we're including them in it from the beginning,  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:07):**  Oliver, then they should be ready to go by the implementation stage, right? They should  
**[0:55:12-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:12):**  be like running full speed. If they've invited us in, right? That means that they're willing  
**[0:55:18-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:18):**  to put something into it. So it's not a charity anymore. It's like, okay, we're going to put  
**[0:55:23-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:23):**  some stuff into it, you're going to put some stuff into it. You know, we're going to do  
**[0:55:26-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:26):**  some interesting regenerative development work here. And like, we're just exiting out  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:32):**  of a project now. It's like, it's, it's made me so proud. Oliver, we've been working in  
**[0:55:37-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:37):**  a, in a village in southern Nepal, which is, you know, what we call the untouchables. I  
**[0:55:44-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:44):**  think we touched up talked about the cast system. Yeah, in the Hindu caste system. We've  
**[0:55:50-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:50):**  been working in this village for almost four years. And we're, we're exiting this project  
**[0:55:55-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:55:55):**  now because there's nothing for us to do now, Oliver, like the woman just took over, you  
**[0:56:00-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:00):**  know, we did the literacy with them, right? We worked on some education things, we've  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:04):**  been doing skill building, capacity building, you know, and and the woman just like, they  
**[0:56:10-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:10):**  don't need us anymore. And it's such a beautiful thing. Right. And it's really for me, this  
**[0:56:15-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:15):**  project has just been like, wow, perfect, you know, like exactly how it can be done.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:21):**  Exactly these women, like if you go and meet these women, man, you will just you'll like  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:25):**  feel this vibe and energy coming off of them now. We're like, they're just ready to go  
**[0:56:30-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:30):**  at it themselves. So yeah, I think I think there's that's, there's a way of doing it  
**[0:56:36-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:36):**  properly. And it's it's a beautiful thing when you do it that way.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:42):**  One since you've been involved in so many initiatives at this point, have you noticed  
**[0:56:46-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:46):**  any common patterns in these projects that had long term success in contrast to those  
**[0:56:53-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:53):**  that sort of fizzle out?  
**[0:56:55-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:56:55):**  Yeah, definitely. I think one of the patterns is actual need. Yeah, you know, that's when  
**[0:57:02-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:02):**  we talk to clients, our first step doesn't matter who they are, what they think they  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:07):**  want to do. Our first step is, is we go and we do a proper community needs assessment.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:12):**  CNA, we call it a CNA for short, we like to go in, we like to do videos, we like to do  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:18):**  a bunch of games and activities, engage community, you know, all these, these kind of these different  
**[0:57:23-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:23):**  ways of collecting information and building relationships with the people. But there's  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:30):**  so many things going on where there's actually just not a need for what people want to do,  
**[0:57:35-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:35):**  even if they perceive that there's a need like building a school. Oh, my God, there's  
**[0:57:39-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:39):**  just like, sorry, I'm talking about schools, just because everybody that comes from Nepal,  
**[0:57:44-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:44):**  they want to build a school in some remote village somewhere. And it's like, there's  
**[0:57:47-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:47):**  more schools than there is actual teachers in Nepal or something now. Wow. Yeah, so that's  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:53):**  a that's a big pattern is just what really is there a need there? And what is that need?  
**[0:57:59-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:57:59):**  And then you know, you you design towards that or for that, then you know, and then  
**[0:58:06-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:06):**  I think another pattern I've, I've seen is there needs to be decent leadership in the  
**[0:58:14-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:14):**  community and in the village. If you're going into a village where like, nobody's willing  
**[0:58:19-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:19):**  to stand up, nobody's willing to like take the lead on anything, you know, it's it then  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:24):**  it's for me, it's like, Oh, man, we got to go a few steps back then and like, take some  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:29):**  young people and and help build up their capacity for a few years to be leaders, you know, but  
**[0:58:35-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:35):**  when you go in and you have an especially for us, it's like, especially when you have  
**[0:58:39-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:39):**  like a strong women, because women are really in these kind of villages, women are really  
**[0:58:44-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:44):**  the heart of the community, the man might be like the microphone and talking and doing  
**[0:58:48-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:48):**  the politics and stuff like that. But the woman is the heart of the families, the kitchen,  
**[0:58:54-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:54):**  the food systems, the farming systems. So like when you have like a really empowered  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:58:58):**  and strong women who will stand up and, you know, be willing to take on responsibilities  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:03):**  and leadership and stuff like that, then it gets really easy to work. So that's, that's  
**[0:59:08-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:08):**  another pattern I've observed a lot. Yeah.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:11):**  Incredible. Well, look, unfortunately, we've been going for like an hour and we could I  
**[0:59:17-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:17):**  don't I don't see us slowing down whatsoever. So why don't we maybe put a bookmark in this  
**[0:59:22-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:22):**  and leave it for another session. In the meantime, how can our listeners get in touch with you  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:27):**  learn more about your projects and follow your work?  
**[0:59:31-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:31):**  Yeah, I'm great. Oliver, I will get on updating the websites and stuff like that. That's my  
**[0:59:38-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:38):**  monsoon.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:39):**  In your defense, it's not in bad shape. Your website, all your web presence looks really  
**[0:59:44-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:44):**  good, even though it may not have the latest information.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:47):**  Yeah, well, and I will I will get better with that. I am better like so we're mostly on  
**[0:59:54-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=0:59:54):**  Facebook, and Instagram is kind of where I'm regularly updating because I can just I can  
**[1:00:01-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:01):**  do that from my phone and quick and dirty and get it off and done and stuff. Mostly  
**[1:00:06-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:06):**  our audience is Nepali. So I am sorry if if I do communicate a lot in Nepali, although  
**[1:00:11-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:11):**  I do try to do a lot more in English so everybody can understand. We do have a new  
**[1:00:17-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:17):**  project coming up, Oliver, and I mean, now it's a whole nother conversation, but we actually  
**[1:00:21-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:21):**  got really, really big funding to to do some some big projects out here in East Nepal.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:29):**  So over the coming years, we are going to release 48 different videos about agroecology,  
**[1:00:37-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:37):**  agroecology in Nepal, and just a whole diversity of topics which are appropriate for  
**[1:00:45-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:45):**  Nepali people and more than the poly people appropriate for everybody but frame for the  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:52):**  poly people. So we'll be we'll be communicating through Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those  
**[1:00:57-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:00:57):**  are the best places to get hold of us. And maybe by September, the websites will have  
**[1:01:02-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:02):**  a little bit more information and be a little bit more integrated with the social media.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:07):**  But yeah, incredible. That's really, really exciting. I'm looking forward to seeing those  
**[1:01:11-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:11):**  developments start to be released. Look, yeah, and you know, I really defer to a lot of your  
**[1:01:18-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:18):**  expertise on this, but I hope that this conversation will spur others as well, because I by no  
**[1:01:24-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:24):**  means I'm an expert. I'm very much still in the learning phase. I've been able to glean  
**[1:01:29-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:29):**  some information, especially from examples of people like you and others that I've been  
**[1:01:32-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:32):**  able to interact with both in person and through the podcast network. But I really encourage  
**[1:01:38-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:38):**  people to join on the discord server because you and I have plenty of conversations there.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:43):**  You've been quite active, and it's a really good place to exchange ideas because there's  
**[1:01:47-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:47):**  a lot of us who have moved to foreign areas are navigating new cultures, learning how  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:52):**  to communicate within those dynamics, and becoming better listeners and participants  
**[1:01:57-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:01:57):**  rather than pushing agendas or trying to, you know, move things along with our preconceived  
**[1:02:03-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zac-barton-on-building-community-in-a-foreign-country/#t=1:02:03):**  notions. And it's really great to see voices like yours, and so many other really inspiring

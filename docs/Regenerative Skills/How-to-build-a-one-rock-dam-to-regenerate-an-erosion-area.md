**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:10:49):**  If you want to learn, here's what you do.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:10:51):**  You start at the top of a watershed where things are very, very small.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:10:58):**  You go to a not very big gully that doesn't have powerful floods that will move a bowling  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:08):**  ball sized rock.

**[0:11:19-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:19):**  And when I was teaching myself, I had rocks the size of lemons and I put them in a teeny,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:32):**  teeny, tiny little rill where I saw water had flowed.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:37):**  And then when it was raining hard, I'd go out and I'd watch and I'd see what happened  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:40):**  to that.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:42):**  And then I worked up to slightly larger systems.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:47):**  And so what you do is you go in and you make a row of rocks that goes across the gully,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:55):**  but it's only one rock high.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:11:58):**  It's only like if you used one foot rocks, you'd bury them most of the way.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:12:02):**  So this thing doesn't even, this doesn't even stick up.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:12:06):**  Okay, so I'm getting a real sense of how this works, but I can foresee one potential problem.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:12:12):**  What if you're in an area that doesn't have any stones?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:12:14):**  I mean, I can't imagine that your first idea should be to bring them in from elsewhere.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:12:20):**  If there are no stones available, then probably stones are inappropriate because if your water

**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:12:39):**  And you need to find out how your water course has been dissipating energy and dissipated  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:12:46):**  that way.

**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:00):**  large diameter wooden stakes, similarly buried deep with just a few inches sticking out above  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:05):**  the ground and arranged in an alternating pattern, almost like a pegboard on the gully  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:10):**  floor.

**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:13):**  So imagine you have a silt bed stream.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:18):**  A lot of places, a lot of arid places in China have, it's called loess, like L-O-E-S-S.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:27):**  That's like silt that has zero stick-to-itiveness and it's like totally fucking erodible.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:37):**  If you try to stop erosion in a system like that with rocks, the silt will just rinse  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:44):**  away from around your rocks and the rocks will dig themselves holes and they'll go to

**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:13:58):**  So in a system like that, what you need to do is you need to dissipate energy.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:14:04):**  And the very best way to dissipate energy is to split it and split it and split it further  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:14:12):**  still.

**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:14:27):**  It has to flow around millions of tiny little stems.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:14:34):**  Each one taking a little of the kinetic energy and relieving it of any silt that it may have

**[0:14:41-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:14:41):**  And working in concert in legions to change the physics of a vast surface.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:14:52):**  Yeah, and especially with plant matter too, those stems don't only affect the surface,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:14:58):**  but they also offer a path for the water to infiltrate deeper in if it's slowed down enough.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:15:04):**  It's giving it a path to enter into the ground as well.

**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:15:19):**  one place at the bottom of the watershed.

**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:15:40):**  Van and I also talked about how these small installations lend themselves to much longer

**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:15:50):**  They lend themselves perfectly to being integrated with living infrastructure.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:15:54):**  That means real regeneration of the ecosystem as a whole.

**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:16:01):**  The vegetation is more important than the dams.

**[0:16:19-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:16:19):**  So we're always trying to incorporate our structures into existing trees and vegetation.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:16:31):**  And that also helps irrigate that.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:16:33):**  It makes it stronger and its roots grow among the rocks and form a guild.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:16:39):**  So we're always designing our work to cause more water to soak into the ground in the

**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:16:55):**  the rocks get eroded.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:16:57):**  And I've got plenty of places where that happened.

**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:17:35):**  The vegetation has got this one.

**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:17:43):**  The One Rock Dam is a way to stabilize the floor of the gully so that it doesn't erode

**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:17:57):**  By trapping sediment and slowing the water, it's giving the native vegetation the opportunity

**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:18:20):**  What you have to do is go and look and see what's growing there and know about other

**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:18:41):**  Is it normally dry?  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:18:43):**  If so, how deep is the moist zone?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:18:48):**  What could grow here?

**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:18:59):**  I'd seed with the native seed and wildflower mix from your area.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:19:06):**  And if you're going to build a one rock dam, put the seeds down before the rocks so that  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:19:13):**  critters won't be able to find them as easy and some of them might survive.

**[0:19:43-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:19:43):**  a six foot long, one inch, sorry for the US unit.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:19:52):**  Two point five centimeters.

**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:20:24):**  Stick a willow in there and do it a hundred more times, right?

**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-a-one-rock-dam-to-regenerate-an-erosion-area/#t=0:20:46):**  They don't all grow, only about like 95% of them grow.

**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:18):**  We've got a ton of baby goats.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:20):**  The systems are starting to really get dialed in, and there's quite a few new developments  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:25):**  on the farm, which we'll get to pretty soon.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:27):**  But before we get into all of that, I want to let all of our listeners in on some new  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:32):**  developments.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:33):**  And yeah, just the basics of it is I'm actually going to be transitioning out of the farm,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:39):**  and the farm is going to continue in its own direction, and I'm going to start taking Abundant  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:43):**  Edge into some new directions as well.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:46):**  So Neil, kind of tell me about how this has been working out in between us.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:51):**  Yeah, I mean, this is something that I guess I can't say we planned like this down to a  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:02:58):**  T or anything like that, but it was a good thing that we did.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:01):**  We left some wiggle room in sort of the initial way that we set up the business arrangement,  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:09):**  always with the, I think, this vision that you had in mind that a really abundant edge.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:16):**  The principal team, the principal design and consultancy team is like yourself, obviously,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:22):**  with all your natural building expertise.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:25):**  And then kind of me as an agronomist and Jeremy as a botanist, a landscaper.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:31):**  I think that was really what drew you into this vision, this project that we're starting  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:36):**  here.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:37):**  And essentially what has transpired, what you've done is you've come in, you acted as  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:42):**  a seed investor, you lent your energy and your expertise to the project.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:49):**  Now because of the direction you want to go in, which is more of an international traveling  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:55):**  online content one, you're going to tell us all about that.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:03:59):**  You're going to recoup your investment and we're going to stay here and focus on the  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:05):**  farm.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:07):**  Once we kind of talked it over, it really did seem like an ideal thing for you and Abundant  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:12):**  Edge to focus on, which is this kind of getting projects off the ground and getting them to  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:18):**  a kind of a homeostasis.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:21):**  And it seems to be, as I've got to know you, the thing that excites you most is the initial  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:26):**  planning and implementation and relative location of evidence.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:30):**  For sure, and these days I'm really passionate about spreading knowledge to people who are  
**[0:04:44-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:44):**  going to be implementing it.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:53):**  I'm looking at new ways of getting that out to a larger audience and giving them the support  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:04:57):**  that they need to do similar type projects or go in a different direction but still with  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:02):**  regenerative skills and outcomes in mind.

**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:14):**  project about 15 months ago.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:16):**  Yeah, it's getting around that.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:19):**  The core team has really been working on it for just over a year now.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:23):**  It's been about 13 months of actual on the ground work from the three of us.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:27):**  Amazing advances really in terms of where we've gotten to.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:32):**  But also I feel like, and this is why I want to focus so much now on going the last 20  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:39):**  percent.

**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:46):**  We've got an animal system that's really working and is really productive.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:51):**  We're selling through our cafe restaurant like really high quality products, organic  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:05:56):**  products.

**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:03):**  the really important thing.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:05):**  I also realized that consulting, which is one of the abundant edges, main wings, consulting  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:12):**  really is about passing on the wisdom of experience.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:16):**  Just from the last year, aside from all the kind of technical things we've learned, I  
**[0:06:19-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:19):**  think that we've learned a lot about equitable ways to structure businesses between co-investors.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:28):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:29):**  I know I've learned a ton about that in this experience.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:33):**  And I think this separation, although like you said it wasn't really planned from the  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:06:37):**  beginning, first of all isn't like a full separation.

**[0:08:27-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:08:27):**  I've always seen a lot of synergies between us and I still see that because really what

**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:08:59):**  to the place as I can.

**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:09:10):**  five o'clock in the morning walking around the farm, sitting under the moon and meditating

**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:09:24):**  a designer, a business consultant would probably tell me I shouldn't be doing.

**[0:09:36-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:09:36):**  to the not just the earth, but the actual local specific kind of set of or the local

**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:09:53):**  set up here.

**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:09:58):**  to share that profit and spread out that goodwill to the community.

**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:05):**  There's our farm, there's our community reforestation project.

**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:25):**  Well, here, let's move on to that real quick.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:28):**  I think just to kind of highlight the contrast of the directions that we're going to be moving  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:33):**  in with you focusing much more on the ground and on the community here, building those  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:38):**  connections and using that experience when you work as a designer and consultant on other  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:43):**  projects is going to be hugely valuable.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:45):**  I really respect that direction.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:48):**  And no one vice versa.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:49):**  I think, too, that I'll be working towards that at a later date.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:54):**  I see some of my more direct involvement and the projects that I'll be able to kind of  
**[0:10:59-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:10:59):**  invest in in the longer term being more towards the suburban and the urban context just because  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:06):**  I see not only as populations shift into that style of living, I really want to explore  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:12):**  more of the opportunities for people who live in those environments to do regenerative work  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:17):**  and not have to abandon their careers, their lifestyle, the conveniences of modern living  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:23):**  and more urban living.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:25):**  And I feel like that's still one of the areas of holistic design, regenerative living, permaculture,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:31):**  whatever you want to call it, that's maybe not as advanced as some of the farming aspects  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:38):**  and some of the land-based aspects.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:40):**  So I love that the diversity of our team and the amount of experience that we're going  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:48):**  to be getting from these two different contexts is going to add so much value to the clients  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:53):**  and the projects that we help along the way for having this diversity of perspective.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:11:58):**  Yeah, for sure.

**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:12:08):**  for me, it's exciting to know that I can really, really hone my skills here, hopefully, in

**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:12:30):**  on increasingly bigger projects and extending my influence, which there's no way I would

**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:12:53):**  I had plenty of design and experience and education behind me when I started, what we've

**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:09):**  will in the future prove to be invaluable because really my main motivation for doing  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:15):**  this and especially my main motivation for being involved in the Abundant Edge is we  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:19):**  want to see more projects succeed.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:20):**  Yeah, definitely.

**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:26):**  we've gone through and then overcome, but seeing other people fail with similar types  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:31):**  of problems.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:33):**  I think it's going to be a very valuable sort of high value service that we can provide  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:39):**  in the future, not just on the sort of landscape design and natural building, but also around

**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:54):**  Because like I say, it's defining goals, defining direction.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:13:58):**  It's a lot of things that people do on faith in the beginning.

**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:14:02):**  I mean, if you can't start with some faith and trust in other people, definitely don't

**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:14:18):**  But what we do know is that we're both trustworthy, honorable people.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:14:22):**  So we worked from that assumption and we were always very careful about how we communicated  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:14:27):**  with each other.

**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:14:35):**  I mean, you know, as much as getting the farm and the building started and everything, I

**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:14:46):**  Learning how to work within a very close knit group like this where we're actually sharing  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:14:50):**  a lifestyle, not just a business model.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:14:53):**  And the unexpected things that can come up and how to deal with it from a mature and  
**[0:15:00-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:15:00):**  I guess a perspective of realizing that it's part of something bigger and that your needs  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:15:08):**  or your wants need to somehow fit within a group mentality and define the direction that  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:15:14):**  we're going to be working on together.

**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:15:20):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:15:21):**  It's amazing what we've been able to do over this last year and the people that have been

**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:15:28):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:15:29):**  It is a very fledgling project.

**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:15:51):**  I know it's been, I think, more of a challenge to actually keep up with all of the momentum

**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:02):**  fast enough.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:03):**  We're not going to have the support or the funds or whatever it is to move at the pace

**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:11):**  It's been keeping up with the momentum that's been a bigger challenge.

**[0:16:20-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:20):**  on its own and interact with the other systems at the same time that, I mean, you can crunch  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:28):**  the numbers and do all these sort of predictions for the future, but you really don't know  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:33):**  until it starts.

**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:40):**  a rate that is a lot easier to maintain and observe.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:44):**  But animals, within hours, something could go wrong.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:47):**  Yeah.

**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:16:56):**  but surely, but definitely starting.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:00):**  I guess it's the luxury that you have a little bit as a designer of these systems over, say,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:07):**  building a house is that you can really do what we did with the composting animal house,  
**[0:17:13-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:13):**  just sort of build a cheap, somewhat temporary but functional structure, which we know that  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:22):**  we see that it's working and we see that it can be expanded to be the centerpiece of the  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:28):**  farm.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:29):**  But building it that way in sort of a small kind of with recycled materials and patched  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:36):**  together, I think is a model that anyone should follow, especially if they're on kind of a  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:41):**  limited budget and they have time to work with.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:44):**  Because what we've been able to do with that way of building kind of, I don't want to say  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:49):**  non-essential infrastructure, but maybe very low criteria for initial start is that you  
**[0:17:56-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:17:56):**  can watch how it works in real time over the weeks and months as the different animals  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:04):**  interact with it.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:05):**  And the amount of small alterations that we've made in the last year have transformed it  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:09):**  from what it originally was.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:11):**  The access ports, the feeding areas, the extension for new goats as we got them, figuring out  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:17):**  a semi-permeable barrier where chickens can come in and out but the goats can't.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:22):**  And now the extensions that you're planning for further use of the place, like that has  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:27):**  saved us a ton of money than if we had designed what we thought was perfect from the beginning,  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:33):**  built it all out really well permanently and then having to go back and retrofit something  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:40):**  that was that established would have definitely been more expensive.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:43):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:44):**  But it's, I mean, I guess there's different ways of doing it, right?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:48):**  I think at the end of this year, we will, or yeah, by the time, you know, in a year  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:18:55):**  from now, I think we will have a lot of sort of go-to prototypes in our mind for things  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:01):**  like this for, you know, a coffee or other.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:04):**  Oh yeah, I'm really looking forward to writing out and drawing out those manuals.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:09):**  So there is like, I feel like there is, things will become more set, especially in how we  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:15):**  approach projects for people who actually have the investment capital to get permanent  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:20):**  things in place once and for all.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:23):**  Yep.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:24):**  So that people can jumpstart it and not having to go through all of the learning process  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:28):**  that we did.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:29):**  And I'm not having to be onsite themselves, directing volunteers and having the pickaxe  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:35):**  and the hammer in their hand, you know, so there's different ways you can come up, you  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:39):**  can come about these things.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:41):**  I think increasingly people are going to, you know, get some investment money together,

**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:51):**  You know, they wouldn't have aces, they say in Spanish, but there's a beauty in doing  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:54):**  it the other way as well, if you're so inclined.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:19:58):**  And yeah, I mean, no, you know, no going back to that animal house and the farm against  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:04):**  it, we talked about it a lot on these regenerative kind of round table things.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:09):**  And I think we're going to put out a video pretty soon.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:12):**  But what sort of emerged from all this is that the kind of animal system with the goats,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:18):**  the chickens, the coffee depulping, those are kind of like the coffee processing and  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:26):**  the sort of organic market garden.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:30):**  That's a kind of that sort of four elements that we see as being like the centerpiece  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:36):**  of the farm.

**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:42):**  all of those enterprises are interconnected and feed into one another.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:46):**  That's the thing I've been most impressed of, because, you know, each one on its own  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:51):**  isn't really the economic driver that can keep this place afloat.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:20:55):**  But the way that they connect with all the other enterprises not only make the best use  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:01):**  of all the materials coming in and out and transforming them in a very efficient way,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:06):**  but also the few waste products that are produced for each one cycle through as feed products  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:11):**  for others.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:13):**  And you know, maybe the loop isn't entirely closed for any given enterprise, but it weaves  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:18):**  in a connective way through the rest of the enterprises.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:21):**  And that loop is almost entirely closed at that point.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:25):**  Very few imports are being brought in.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:27):**  Yeah, the whole idea of like a closed loop goat house doesn't make sense.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:33):**  But it's exactly like you described.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:35):**  In isolation it doesn't make sense.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:36):**  It's much more like a flowchart actually.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:39):**  You know, so well, so let's talk a little bit more about how the farm itself is advancing  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:45):**  forward.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:46):**  Some of the main initiatives that you're spearheading in the months to come.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:49):**  And certainly we'll be continuing to check in even as I go off and travel and move to  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:53):**  other areas.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:55):**  But tell me kind of what the projection is for the next few months.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:21:59):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:00):**  No, it's, this sounds a little confusing, but I think if you break it down, it's actually  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:04):**  pretty simple.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:05):**  So everyone knows we've got the goats and we've got an adjacent chicken house, which  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:10):**  is kind of built on a little slope.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:14):**  And that essentially functions like a kind of a tumble down compost system.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:17):**  The goat house gets cleaned out onto the first level of the chicken house, then that gets  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:22):**  cleaned out onto the second level of the chicken house and then outside the chicken house where  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:25):**  it gets made into like hot piles of bocasci where it's sort of a mixture of manures.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:32):**  The chicken house also serves to absorb all of the waste from our little cafe restaurant  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:38):**  and another bigger cafe restaurant nearby.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:43):**  And so, and you know, it's also where all of the organic waste from anywhere we can  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:49):**  get goes.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:50):**  Yeah, we've got a few restaurants and businesses donating their organic waste at the moment.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:22:57):**  We should probably be charging them for that service.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:00):**  But yeah, so it's like that allows us, that whole system allows us to massively cut down  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:07):**  on the feed for our chickens, especially because I think you've got another podcast episode  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:12):**  where someone talks about how disheartening it is actually to work with chickens and realize  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:15):**  how much grain you need to feed them.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:19):**  So we do feed our chickens grain, but actually most of it is corn, which is fermented in  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:25):**  the way of the goats, which is another byproduct from the goat system.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:30):**  So you know, both the manure, and really have to see this to believe it, but when you see  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:36):**  the amount of building the house so the chickens can come in underneath and then go into the  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:42):**  goat pen, sit on their backs, pick kind of ticks out of them and also like scratching  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:47):**  their manure and essentially clean their house for them.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:51):**  That plus being able to give them the high protein whey with a kind of mineral mix that  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:23:57):**  we actually make ourselves here and some locally grown corn.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:01):**  That's a fantastic supplement or substitute for these kind of like concentrates.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:08):**  And so that word, that's a nice symbiotic thing just on its own.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:12):**  But then just above that whole system, we put in our coffee depulping station.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:18):**  And again, it's based off a pretty standard model.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:22):**  You know, we just depulp the coffee, take all of the, and really the whole driving force  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:28):**  behind doing it was I really, really wanted to capture and store that energy of the coffee,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:34):**  all that.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:35):**  Which is kind of the main cash crop of this area.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:38):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:39):**  And if it's not being used correctly, it's a waste product.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:41):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:42):**  And so, you know, what I've had as a vision for a long time is to have this farm as a  
**[0:24:49-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:49):**  sort of a zone one, two farm where we've got our animals, our organic garden, our forest  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:24:59):**  garden, which will take up about sort of 60 or 70% of the land eventually.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:04):**  A diverse kind of perennial forest garden.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:07):**  But then that our zone three kind of commercial zone, instead of acquiring more land, we simply  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:13):**  want to work with the community who already do quite a sustainable type of agroforestry  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:18):**  in the sense that they grow coffee and shade trees.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:22):**  Now, they're a little bit, there's some management techniques that they don't have that they  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:28):**  can really, really use.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:31):**  So it's something we're working on with our partner, Tim and Shangri-La to put together  
**[0:25:35-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:35):**  a package of workshops on management of coffee in an agroforestry system.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:44):**  We put the coffee de-pulper here.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:46):**  The great thing about doing that is we can recycle all of the waste products from the  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:52):**  coffee processing, which normally get wasted and actually in a lot of cases kind of contaminate  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:25:57):**  the lake through leaching because the coffee pulp is a fantastically rich, I think it has  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:02):**  a carbon ratio of 20 to 1, which for anyone who's into composting, they'll know that that's  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:06):**  like a nice number.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:09):**  You know, it needs very little carbon to break down in a really, really efficient way.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:14):**  So that also goes in through that system and just massively improves the kind of quantity  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:22):**  and quality of the compost we produce.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:27):**  And so that in tandem with offering that compost that we produce to the coffee growers, in  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:36):**  tandem with free support species.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:42):**  So we have a lot of, we've talked about this in another podcast, but we have a lot of grafted  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:46):**  heirloom avocados from this area, which are a great shade tree, native nitrogen fixers  
**[0:26:53-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:26:53):**  and just really good hardwood, quite fast growing trees like Huachipilin and Cucheen  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:27:02):**  that are beautiful, support all these other forms of life and just happen to be great  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:27:07):**  support species for the coffee.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:27:10):**  And then actually a series of workshops on basic management techniques that our friend  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:27:16):**  Lorenzo is going to be heading up, which sort of focus around kind of like small little  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:27:21):**  adjustments you can make to the pH of the soil and the amount of light that enters through  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:27:26):**  pruning that can have pruning techniques that keep it in a fruiting cycle for much longer.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:27:32):**  So you can, you know, our vision essentially is to have our zone three extend right out

**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:33:47):**  I realize that a lot of people are a little more adverse to running animal systems for

**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:33:54):**  They definitely are higher maintenance.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:33:56):**  Right.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:33:57):**  And some people have, you know, hang ups for like the diet or even wanting animals altogether.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:03):**  But that's a whole nother topic.

**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:11):**  and meeting your own needs in a sort of sustainable, regenerative way, you know, even up at Chad's  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:17):**  farm, I love what he's done.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:19):**  He has these beautiful, mature food forests where he grows, you know, lots of turmeric,  
**[0:34:27-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:27):**  taro root, tree tomato, avocado, nispeiro, citrus.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:36):**  But underneath he has those food forests fenced off and he has houses with multiple doors  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:41):**  so he can range usually meat birds in those food forests.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:45):**  So it just works so well because he's able to raise his good quality meat.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:34:50):**  The birds are psyched down in the shade of the trees.

**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:35:03):**  if you're working with chickens, I think he's able to create this like beautiful, again,

**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:35:33):**  with our neighbors.

**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:35:36):**  They think, oh, your goats are going to go in and ruin my plantation.

**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:05):**  be super happy, and then they'll come home.

**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:12):**  And as long as you don't overtax that land, if you keep them on there all day, they'll

**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:19):**  This is fundamentals of rotational grazing.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:23):**  Individuals must move in packs and they must move every day.

**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:34):**  they call it strip grazing.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:36):**  It's like a clock system.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:40):**  But we can't do that here.

**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:51):**  Well, what I love about that is everything I've learned about land management in any  
**[0:36:56-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:36:56):**  goal or context here is the larger your operation, the more that efficiency and production starts  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:05):**  to dip per size of land under management.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:09):**  So if you have a tenth of an acre in a suburban lot and you manage it really intensely, the  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:13):**  amount of yield you're going to get off that is going to greatly outstrip the caloric and  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:17):**  the nutritional value you can get off of maybe like 10 acres because you can't manage that  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:22):**  ever as intensely as biodynamically.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:26):**  And so, yeah, so there's like this law of diminishing returns as you start to spread  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:29):**  out.

**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:35):**  can be much, much higher.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:38):**  And everyone essentially is invested in everyone.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:37:41):**  For me, I think the real meaning of like a symbiotic relationship between humans is where

**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:03):**  Oh, I love that film.

**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:08):**  That was his realization.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:10):**  And that was what he wrote.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:11):**  Was it like the basis of game theory?  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:13):**  It's the basic game theory.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:16):**  You know, it's that kind of like I'm horrible at maths.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:18):**  There's like a term for it in a mathematic equation where it's like this very strict,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:23):**  like you're working in your interest and the group's interest.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:27):**  So as long as those things are mutually true, that's where you get like real kind of cooperation  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:32):**  and stuff like that.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:34):**  And it's sort of definitely informed my thinking a little bit.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:39):**  And it's kind of what we're trying to build towards here.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:43):**  And again, you know, going back to what we were talking about earlier.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:46):**  So yeah, just to finish on that, what we're now designing is this animal structure.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:38:53):**  We're rebuilding it and expanding it a little bit so that there's a kind of a, the chickens  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:00):**  and the goats, their living conditions are expanded and grown out a little bit.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:06):**  I want to, we're going to roof the whole area.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:09):**  Right now the chicken house especially only has a kind of like a temporary plastic roof  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:12):**  and we're going to expand out that roof roof in the whole area and give it that double  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:17):**  function of being an area to dry our coffee for the coffee processing.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:22):**  Right, because that was one of the difficulties of this last season was finding drying space.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:25):**  Finding drying space.

**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:30):**  This depulp the coffee, put the pulp in through the top of the animal system, put the green

**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:46):**  And we've even, which I haven't talked about yet, found another Jeremy had this like brilliant  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:51):**  idea.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:39:54):**  We've designed and made out of an old metal barrel, a way of turning the coffee shells.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:00):**  Oh, that's right.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:01):**  Yeah, the biochar we're doing now.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:04):**  So the coffee shells are very interesting byproducts.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:06):**  So the coffee pulp is easy to deal with.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:09):**  It's this lovely juicy material that with a bit of carbon turns into lovely compost  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:13):**  and worms love it as well, actually.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:16):**  But the coffee shells, they're, how can I describe this?  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:21):**  They're like dry and sort of like siliconey.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:26):**  They're somewhat, they're somewhat hydrophobic, I've noticed.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:30):**  So when you see them, you're like, oh, it's just like, you know, rice bran or rice hulls  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:37):**  or sorry, wheat hulls.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:40):**  You know, it's just like the hull or like of a kind of a grain.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:42):**  It's going to be like a great mulch or a great carbon source, but it isn't really, they're  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:47):**  not that absorptive.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:49):**  They're somewhat hydrophobic.

**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:40:54):**  don't really do that job very well of absorbing moisture, which is always what you're doing.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:00):**  What you want for your carbon source.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:03):**  And so even though a lot of products from waste products from agriculture are like in  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:09):**  generally wasted, this one is particularly not valued.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:14):**  People really...  
**[0:41:15-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:15):**  Because of that difficulty.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:17):**  People don't know what to do with it.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:18):**  And you know, as you say, it's like worldwide, this is like huge, huge industry.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:23):**  So what we've, where we started to do is, you know, making biochar is easy, right?  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:27):**  Like you basically light a fire and cut the oxygen off and you get this mineralized carbon.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:35):**  But kind of as permacultural as this, that didn't really sit that well with me and Jarek  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:39):**  is like, well, I don't want to just light a fire to make biochar.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:43):**  I want to use that heat in another way.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:46):**  So it was actually Jarek's idea and he got so obsessed with it for like a couple of years.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:51):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:52):**  And we had this recycled barrel that we had previously used for a rocket stove and oven  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:41:58):**  combo that we built in a previous workshop.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:00):**  Right.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:01):**  And I pulled it down because there were some issues with it and quite frankly, we put it  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:04):**  in a place that we weren't going to use it in.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:06):**  So all of the mud that we used for making this stove oven combo is in the walls of our  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:12):**  house right now.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:13):**  Just great way to repurpose that.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:15):**  So we were left with that converted barrel that could easily be used as a burn tray.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:18):**  With, what do you call it, like the bars of iron.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:23):**  Like oven grills.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:24):**  Oven grills, yeah.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:25):**  There you go.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:26):**  So sort of like a big 200 litre metal drum with an oven grill.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:33):**  And what we do actually is we just, we built a little fire pit that it kind of sits on  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:38):**  top of and it seals but doesn't seal completely.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:42):**  So air kind of escapes.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:43):**  And so we light a fire around it.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:45):**  We stuff it with these coffee shells, these dry coffee shells.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:50):**  And we put some meat up on the upper part of it that we want to smoke.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:42:55):**  So we put the meat, we wrap it in tinfoil and it cooks with this like delicious smokey  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:01):**  flavour so we've done so far, we've done like a few lambs, or sorry a few goats.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:08):**  We actually did do some lamb as well because we traded some of our young male goats for  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:13):**  a lamb.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:15):**  We do shads, chickens.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:18):**  You know as we continue to produce more meat, really like I think this is just the way we're  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:22):**  going to cook meat.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:23):**  But what we end up with at the end of it is biochar.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:27):**  And just amazing biochar.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:30):**  Really powdery, really really high quality.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:34):**  We just, afterwards we just like sort of mash it up another little bit and in no time it  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:40):**  turns into just pure powder.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:45):**  And so that again goes into the same system.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:48):**  It cycles through this animal composting system, goes straight into the chicken house.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:52):**  That I feel like cumulatively, if we keep doing that, the effect on the quality of our  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:43:58):**  compost and soil is huge.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:00):**  Because for me, I think biochar is a little bit of a buzzword these days.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:08):**  It's not a magic bullet for sure, but if you've got this diverse kind of, or this way of making  
**[0:44:15-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:15):**  compost from a really diverse mixture of sources, and you can add biochar that you make yourself  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:27):**  into that process.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:28):**  The quality of the compost has just improved enormously, especially here in the tropics  
**[0:44:31-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:31):**  again because I talk about this all the time, the difficulty of keeping the organic, or  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:36):**  keeping the carbon content in your soil up high.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:39):**  It's a challenge, and this is like, this is mineralized carbon, this is an inert material  
**[0:44:44-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:44):**  that will just go in and act like a sponge.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:46):**  So I'm really excited to see the effect of that on our garden, on our property, and on  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:51):**  the wider community as we sort of like scale this project up.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:44:55):**  So I'm also excited to try and make bread in this thing next time around.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:45:00):**  That'll be interesting to see if you can make bread without it getting that smoky flavor.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:45:06):**  You might have to get different pans, just from my experience of it working in a bakery.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:45:09):**  But it could definitely work.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:45:11):**  This is like a prototype model.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:45:13):**  One thing I liked, at least from the cooking perspective, and Jer pointed this out pretty

**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:46:01):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:46:11):**  Right.

**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:46:18):**  And it's a thing that we haven't quite yet done.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:46:21):**  So for those of you interested, look forward to some tours of this farm here, and also  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:46:27):**  some mini tutorials on all of these systems that Neil's just talked about.

**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:46:46):**  Why don't you tell me a little bit about your plans for like the next, I guess the next  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:46:52):**  couple of months and just the direction you see abundant edge going in?  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:46:56):**  Yeah, so there's a lot of different enterprises that I can see feeding into each other.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:47:03):**  It's one of the inspirations of working in these living systems on the farm over the

**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:47:19):**  with the functions that they were already doing.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:47:22):**  You know, so because this podcast has come a long way, actually, this is episode 100.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:47:29):**  So those of you who have been with us up until now, thank you so much for listening and supporting

**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:47:45):**  I didn't have any ambitions that it would get this large when I started it.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:47:48):**  Honestly, I just wanted to have all these conversations with amazing people myself.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:47:54):**  So this has grown and taken on a life of its own and I definitely continue to incrementally  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:00):**  improve it and figure out new ways to get better and better information out.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:05):**  And so one of the ideas that I came up with is having another platform to highlight and  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:12):**  exemplify great examples of regenerative projects around the world.

**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:23):**  good at and I've seen amazing examples all over the world of people doing really, really  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:27):**  inspiring work.

**[0:48:34-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:34):**  social media presence or a way of getting their information out there and helping other  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:38):**  people who could be inspired by their initiatives because it's so much more than farming and  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:43):**  gardening and natural building.

**[0:48:51-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:51):**  I've seen people working on waterway regeneration and city and suburban infrastructure redevelopment  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:48:59):**  and on and on and on.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:49:01):**  And so I'm going to be going along through the travels that I have planned and highlight  
**[0:49:06-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:49:06):**  these projects that people don't know about yet but have really inspiring initiatives  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-building-a-regenerative-future-and-heading-in-different-directions-rrt-13/#t=0:49:10):**  and great knowledge to share.

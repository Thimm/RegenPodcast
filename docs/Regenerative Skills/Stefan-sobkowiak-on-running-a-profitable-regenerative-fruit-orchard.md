**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:31):**  Very good.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:32):**  Sorry for my mistake.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:33):**  No problem.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:34):**  I know you're a busy guy.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:36):**  It's just great to see you.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:38):**  So what do you say we jump into it?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:39):**  Because I know that the participants here are going to have some more questions towards  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:43):**  the end.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:44):**  We've got growers from different parts of Europe.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:46):**  But I will start by giving a little bit of housekeeping and a little introduction to  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:50):**  this call.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:52):**  So welcome, everybody.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:53):**  This is another skill building exchange from the Climate Farmers Network.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:02:57):**  Everybody here is part of our growing network of people who are cultivating different types  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:03):**  of food and managing land in the EU area, and increasingly doing so in regenerative  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:10):**  ways.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:11):**  And we've invited Stefan here at the request of quite a few of our members because of your  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:17):**  incredible experience and knowledge, especially around whole orchard ecosystems.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:22):**  So Stefan Subkoiak is a pioneer of regenerative and whole ecosystem orchard management on  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:28):**  Miracle Farm in Canada.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:30):**  His innovative methods of managing pests and insects through biodiversity, tree crop health  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:36):**  through perennial companion planting, and soil health with animal integration have inspired  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:41):**  people all over the world.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:43):**  And through his teachings, regardless of your climate or your orchard species, the practices  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:48):**  of close observation, nature inspired patterning and symbiotic relationships will help you  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:53):**  to optimize your orchard business anywhere in the world.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:57):**  Now, just keep in mind that this call is being recorded.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:03:59):**  If for any reason you don't want to show up on the recording, you can just leave your  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:03):**  camera and your microphone off and you won't appear.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:07):**  And let's go in right into the first question for Stefan.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:10):**  So let's get an overview about what some of the potential of creating a complete orchard  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:17):**  ecosystem is.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:18):**  And what are some of the key differences between that and conventional orchards?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:23):**  Easiness.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:24):**  Definitely, if it functions as an ecosystem, it functions.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:30):**  If it functions as a monoculture, it's a broken system that you have to keep intervening because  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:36):**  there's a whole bunch of parts of the ecosystem that just aren't there.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:41):**  So really, yeah, that's so nice to not have to deal with this insect or this problem or  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:49):**  another.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:50):**  I'd say that's the major one is how much easier it becomes.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:04:57):**  And so it seems like there's a mindset shift in that, that there are always going to be  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:02):**  challenges and things that come up each season.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:04):**  In fact, that's what we were talking about just before you arrived, how the challenges  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:08):**  of climactic patterns and weather patterns of this season, either heavy rains and extra  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:12):**  humidity and cold in some parts and droughts and wildfires and others have caused people  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:18):**  to have to react in a way that it's something different each season.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:23):**  And that doesn't change whether you've got a fully integrated ecosystem or if you're  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:27):**  managing it in a conventional way.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:29):**  But what is that difference in mindset?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:31):**  You're looking to complete circuits, close loops and make sure that all of the elements  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:37):**  are in place rather than import them artificially.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:40):**  Are there some other key observations that are key to managing that system?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:46):**  I think your word observation is key.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:48):**  I mean, that is often the clue to, oh, this can be done without me having then to intervene.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:56):**  I'll give you an example.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:05:58):**  In our climate, we get snow like we'll typically have 60 centimeters or more during the winter  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:04):**  covering for three months.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:07):**  And in the spring as that snow is melting, we get sun scald.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:12):**  So we get basically a sunburn on the bark of trees because they get very warm in the  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:19):**  day and in the evening, it's usually a high pressure, clear sky.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:23):**  So as soon as the sun goes down, the temperature drops.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:26):**  So we'll hit minus 10, minus 15, sometimes three hours after sunset.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:32):**  And what happens is the tree can't adjust quickly enough in temperature and the bark  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:36):**  cracks.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:37):**  It basically just splits right off.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:40):**  So I used to have to paint trunks of the trees white just to keep them from getting sun scald  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:46):**  until one day while painting, I realized, yeah, I always have to go around this tree  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:51):**  because there's a big shrub in front of it.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:54):**  You know what?  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:06:55):**  If the shrub being on the south of the tree prevents it from getting sun scald, what if  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:01):**  I planted shrubs deliberately in that position, which is the Southwest, because that's where  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:05):**  it gets the maximum evening or late afternoon sun.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:10):**  And if I would do that and I could use a crop shrub, not just the, it was just a wild shrub  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:16):**  that had come up, but I could actually plant something that will give me a crop.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:21):**  And so that was kind of, and it worked, it worked very well.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:24):**  And so that's one of the goals we have.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:25):**  We should have a fruiting shrub to the Southwest of every tree to reduce that effect of sun  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:31):**  scald.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:32):**  But that adds the same amount of trees that we have fruiting will give us that many at  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:37):**  least shrubs that we have fruiting as well.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:41):**  So, I mean, it's the kind of thing where, well, if I did it conventionally or if I did  
**[0:07:46-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:46):**  it in a monoculture way, well that shrub just and go on with your painting of the shrubs  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:56):**  of the trees.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:07:57):**  So observation is really one of the key, but I mean, it's the key to permaculture.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:03):**  That's why it's the first principle.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:04):**  So that mindset is looking around, seeing what's happening and trying to ask, and I  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:11):**  no longer ask, how can I do it 10% better or 20% better, which in the end you think,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:16):**  20% that's great.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:17):**  No, I look around and I think, how can I do it 10 times better if I'm going to intervene,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:23):**  if I'm going to do, and if I'm going to plant, and if I'm going to make a change, how can  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:28):**  that change make the system?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:30):**  Cause it really is the system or that task 10 times better could be 10 times quicker,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:36):**  could be 10 times more profitable, whatever it is.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:41):**  So I mean, that, those are a few things that aren't in the, I would say the usual principles  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:47):**  of making it better, but certainly thinking of it as an ecosystem and always asking why  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:53):**  really we don't ask why, why we have this insect.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:08:57):**  Like I say, my, my caterpillar teacher for us, the whole reason we changed the orchard  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:03):**  was because of a caterpillar.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:05):**  So we have these 10 caterpillars in Europe.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:07):**  You have the Legionnaire right in the Southwest of France.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:13):**  And I don't know how far it, or if it's in Spain, but they basically create these passive  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:18):**  tents and then you'll have these hundreds of thousands of the tremendous damage to the  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:25):**  orchard.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:26):**  Like we would often get a quarter of the trees completely eaten and when they're completely  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:31):**  eaten, that tree isn't going to do anything this year.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:34):**  It won't do anything next year cause it couldn't put up any reserves.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:37):**  And so you're two out of three years, a whole part of the orchard is not doing anything.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:43):**  And he used to cut those things off until we had a huge year and just a quick count,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:50):**  we had at least a thousand nests of these caterpillars on a small acreage.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:09:55):**  I mean, we only have 12 acres and so most of them are in the tops of the trees.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:00):**  So you, you know, move a ladder for a thousand nests.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:03):**  It's a huge job and they grow so fast.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:06):**  So I ended up, I was defeated.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:10):**  I mean, I admitted, okay, you have me caterpillar.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:13):**  You got me beaten.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:14):**  I'm done.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:15):**  There's nothing I can do.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:16):**  So I ended up, I basically just stopped and I said, okay, caterpillar, what are you trying  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:20):**  to teach me?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:22):**  I mean, you know, I got to the point, I mean, you're driven to, you don't have a choice.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:28):**  Something, something has to change because I am completely beaten.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:32):**  You've got me beaten.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:33):**  I had the idea of putting the pesticides and I could have used even organic pesticides.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:37):**  I was organic and no, it, that was not an option to me because that just means I don't  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:43):**  know what's going on.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:44):**  I haven't figured it out.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:46):**  And so let me intervene so I could get a quick fix.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:50):**  That's what agriculture is all based on quick fix.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:53):**  I have this problem, put this product and that's not how an ecosystem works.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:10:57):**  So I, I asked the caterpillar, you know, what's going on?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:01):**  What do I have to do?  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:03):**  And why are you here so much?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:05):**  So it was like, bang, clear as day.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:08):**  Well, you've created a buffet for me.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:12):**  I was like, what?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:15):**  You created a buffet.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:18):**  And I mean, I knew it, but it took a caterpillar, you know, or it's my inner voice, whatever,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:25):**  but it took that question and answer to me to go, okay, that's confirmed.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:32):**  That is the problem.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:33):**  The problem is as long as the orchard is 3000 apple trees and nothing else, grass, but grass  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:41):**  and trees, that's all.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:43):**  As long as it's that of a monoculture, I will continually have these caterpillars.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:48):**  They will not stop because they have a buffet.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:51):**  There's nothing preventing them from marching down the rows and there were 110 trees in  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:56):**  a row.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:11:57):**  They could start anywhere in the middle and just go in one direction and just keep eating  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:01):**  trees.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:04):**  So that was the start of saying, okay, if it's a buffet, I've got to make it less of  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:09):**  a buffet.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:11):**  And that's where, well, I had, I had been teaching permaculture even at that time.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:15):**  And I realized, you know what?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:16):**  I got this orchard.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:17):**  It's far from being permaculture.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:19):**  It's a total monoculture.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:21):**  And I looked, you know, yeah, my neighbor has corn.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:24):**  My, my apple orchard isn't different from his corn field.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:28):**  It's still a monoculture.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:29):**  Okay.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:30):**  I have grass and trees, but it's still a monoculture.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:35):**  And so we got going, start to rip.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:40):**  Then we ripped out all the, almost the whole orchard and we replanted, which I recommend  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:45):**  to people do not do.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:47):**  Don't tear out an orchard that's existing and productive.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:50):**  Buy another piece of land, do it somewhere else or even overgraph the part of your orchard,  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:55):**  but don't tear it all out.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:12:57):**  That's it's not, I mean, if your orchard is profitable, if you're, if it's working, try  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:02):**  it somewhere else, but don't tear it.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:05):**  That's a huge hit you for, you know, you take out trees that are generating money and now  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:09):**  you no longer have money coming in.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:11):**  And in fact, you have a lot of expenses to replant.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:14):**  But anyway, I did it just because still I'm kind of stubborn and it was like, this is  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:19):**  where we're going and this is where we're going to go.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:23):**  And so finally we replanted.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:24):**  We went through a first cycle about two years after planting and it was like, there's caterpillars,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:31):**  but they're in a few trees, but they're not marching the way they would.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:36):**  So it was like, okay, that's interesting.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:39):**  But then I waited and I waited another three years.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:41):**  Then we, the trees were, then they were starting to produce and the trees were getting bigger  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:46):**  and the caterpillars came.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:48):**  And after that second wave of caterpillars, and I realized, wow, the most they've eaten  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:13:54):**  rather than eating a whole tree and then multiple trees, the most they ate was a part of one  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:00):**  branch, which one branch on a tree that has 12, 15 branches.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:05):**  That's not a big deal.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:07):**  And I was like, that was to me, the, the turning point.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:10):**  Now I was convinced that it would work because for four or five years, I didn't even say  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:16):**  anything because I wasn't sure that it would work.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:19):**  And so that's kind of the, I don't remember even what your question was Oliver, but I  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:26):**  mean, that's the roundabout way of getting to point out that some of the main differences,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:31):**  first of all, get away from monoculture, absolutely observe and try to have your system mimic  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:38):**  an ecosystem.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:41):**  Yeah, that's a fantastic story.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:42):**  And I've followed your material for a long time.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:44):**  And I've seen some of the progressions as you've hit these aha moments from the observation  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:49):**  and the feedback loops that you're constantly learning from, because you're also trying  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:53):**  out new things and things are coming into different points of maturation and succession  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:14:59):**  as you go along.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:01):**  So there's always something new to react to and observe from.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:03):**  And I've really enjoyed watching your process in that way.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:06):**  Can you talk about some of the aha moments or some of the epiphanies that you've had  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:11):**  when it comes to applying nutrition to the trees?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:15):**  Because oftentimes this is seen as one of the areas where you need to bring in some  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:19):**  inputs, either making compost or synthetic inputs conventionally, but you have an approach  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:25):**  of creating polyculture plantings and other ecosystem benefits from the addition of life  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:31):**  to the orchard.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:32):**  You want to talk about that?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:34):**  I rely on the support species.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:39):**  And so far, I mean, this year we have a huge crop coming.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:45):**  And it's like, gee, if I was getting more, I really don't know right off what we would  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:50):**  be doing with more of a crop.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:52):**  So we could and how high is high?  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:15:56):**  Well, I look at it as how high at no cost.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:01):**  Like this is high enough for no cost if if I wanted to put in extras.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:07):**  Gee, sure.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:10):**  You know, I can't say we do zero fertilizing.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:13):**  Actually, we do zero in this way of putting compost.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:17):**  We do zero in the way of ending any addition of fertilizers.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:21):**  I do use whey occasionally this year.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:23):**  We only use twice.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:25):**  We put whey, which is the byproduct of cheese making.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:31):**  And we do run chickens through the orchard.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:34):**  So those do an addition.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:37):**  But definitely not enough.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:39):**  Like we could use 10 times as many chickens.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:43):**  We could use 15 or 20 sprays of whey.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:50):**  But I'm very happy with the level that it's at.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:56):**  Inputs are a bit of a treadmill.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:16:59):**  Because you could get hooked on inputs and hey, yeah, it gives a good result.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:04):**  And you know, farm the sun to the max.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:08):**  That's one of the key things first.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:10):**  Like if you have bare ground, well, you're just losing sunshine, you know.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:15):**  So I would say I always say the cheapest input by far is water.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:19):**  If you're using compost or fertilizer, but you're not adding water at key times when  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:25):**  it's needed, you're spending way more than you need to water is by far as long as you  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:31):**  have access to water and abundance, which we do.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:34):**  Gee, pumping water for us is about $300 a year.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:41):**  And we're growing on literally a beach sand, our neighbor is sand dunes.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:47):**  So if we didn't add water, we would be stressing the plants tremendously.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:52):**  Like, why put fertilizer if you're not going to put water?  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:17:57):**  To me, that's like, it really doesn't make sense.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:00):**  If you're relying on rain and Oliver, I know you're in Spain, I mean, you can have some  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:05):**  pretty long dry periods.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:08):**  Well, if you could add water, even once every two weeks, through that dry spell, what you  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:16):**  would be capturing sun because if your plant is shutting down, and sometimes shutting down  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:22):**  for a week or two weeks or three weeks or four weeks, well, how are you you're not farming  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:28):**  the sun, like your plant is at a limiting point, and it's limited by water.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:33):**  And then doesn't matter that you gave fertilizer, the fertilizer isn't going to be active either.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:39):**  The compost will barely be active because it's waiting to be humid, moistened.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:45):**  So that's a bit my take on inputs.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:48):**  You know, that's a really good observation, because we do talk a lot about bringing in  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:53):**  biology, especially when it comes to improving soil.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:18:56):**  But if there's no moisture in there, the diversity is going to die out.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:00):**  And much like you were talking about with some of the different inputs that you add,  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:04):**  whether it's whey, whether it's irrigation timing, you're paying close attention to the  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:09):**  developmental stage that your crops or your plants are in, especially with getting to  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:14):**  know orchard plants, there are rhythms that they go through as they start to set seed,  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:20):**  or when they are putting out flower and they're developing fruit, and they need different  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:23):**  things at different times.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:25):**  And you've put out some great resources on how to read the developmental stages and tailor  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:31):**  your inputs to those rather than going by a schedule and saying, hey, you know, it's  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:36):**  July, we irrigate now or we do a spray now, but rather marrying that to the development  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:42):**  of the tree, which can differ quite a bit over the year.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:45):**  Can you talk about some of the observations and the reactions needed to develop over time  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:49):**  so that you are growing and reacting with the plants rather than based on some arbitrary  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:56):**  calendar?  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:19:57):**  Yeah, a few things there.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:02):**  If you can't walk into whatever you're growing, whether it's your garden even, and within  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:09):**  five seconds, if you can't read that there's something going on, you really need to up  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:14):**  your game on observation.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:16):**  I mean, that's so critical because if you like, we're working on a masterclass now and  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:22):**  we just finished our course on observation.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:25):**  And the whole objective of that course to learn how to observe is that you need to know  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:31):**  what is your baseline, what is this is normal.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:35):**  And anytime you're out of normal, things are doing really well or things are not doing  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:40):**  well, that observation should be like within seconds of walking in, you should be able  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:46):**  to go, oh, something's not right here, something's not working.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:50):**  And that's something that you can develop.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:52):**  Sometimes it's visual.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:54):**  It could be auditory.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:55):**  I mean, you could hear that it's very quiet today.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:20:59):**  Something isn't right.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:00):**  It doesn't matter whatever way you would pick it up.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:03):**  Some people can smell things.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:06):**  I can't smell that much in that way, but some people can smell.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:10):**  Some people will taste the soil and know, gee, the soil is really nice now.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:15):**  It's perfect.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:16):**  So that observation is really important.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:19):**  I had a few points.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:21):**  What was the main idea of that question again?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:24):**  Sorry.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:25):**  No, it's okay.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:26):**  So you're just talking about, I guess, the management of all of these cycles and being  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:33):**  able to observe what developmental states that the tree or whatever other crop that  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:37):**  you're cultivating is in rather than going by arbitrary calendars in order to make your  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:42):**  interventions.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:44):**  The most important is flowering because trees are better in the  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:50):**  For example, you can have your focus come up or string bulbs come up, but that's because  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:21:57):**  it's your first five centimetres of soil is at a certain temperature.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:02):**  Bang, they take off.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:04):**  But deeper down where the tree roots are mostly, it hasn't warmed up.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:10):**  So flowering, bud break, those are two key indicators.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:14):**  I say calendar doesn't really mean much.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:17):**  Phenology means much at what stage for that plant are you?  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:22):**  And always keep in mind, doesn't matter.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:26):**  Like this year, for example, we're probably about 16 days ahead of normal year.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:34):**  Like we're harvesting right now.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:36):**  We're harvesting what normally we're harvesting at the end of August.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:40):**  Like that's a big difference.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:43):**  But last year, we were 10 days late through the whole season.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:47):**  So plus or minus, you're talking, it could vary by a month.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:52):**  Any given crop, any given stage could change by a month.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:55):**  So if you go by calendar, you're lost completely.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:22:59):**  It makes no difference because you're going to miss everything.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:02):**  So instead, you need to go by flowering.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:05):**  We knew by flowering, we're already two weeks early.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:08):**  So that was sometimes it catches up a little bit.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:12):**  But this year, it's just gotten hotter and things have been getting earlier and earlier.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:17):**  That is kind of catching us a bit by surprise.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:20):**  But we were expecting that it would be early, but this early is quite something.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:25):**  So yeah, don't go by the calendar.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:28):**  Go understand the phenology.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:30):**  And I would say, get on every, I think every government does some scouting, whether it's  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:38):**  for conventional growers, especially in orchards, or even organic, they'll be scouting the insects,  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:45):**  they'll be scouting the diseases as they show up.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:49):**  They'll be monitoring the weather and they can tell you, well, coddling moth, we caught  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:55):**  the first coddling moth today, they're emerging.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:23:58):**  Have your, they usually recommend have your spray ready, but for me, it's have my traps  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:04):**  ready.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:05):**  So that's important.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:06):**  Get on, I mean, that's a whole team of people who are out there scouting and checking the  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:14):**  phenology of certain crops and they're reporting.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:18):**  So I just get emails, okay, this is what's happening.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:22):**  And listen, you pay through your taxes, take advantage of these services, which usually  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:27):**  are free.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:28):**  They used to be paid, but now they're free.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:30):**  Just get an email or get a text message, whatever.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:33):**  And this is the condition.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:34):**  This is what's happening.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:36):**  People are, you know, that's a lot of resources used to bring you that great information.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:41):**  And even if it's for conventional, but it still applies if you're growing mangoes or  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:46):**  if you're growing whatever it is, there should be some element of scouting going on.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:50):**  Yeah, that's a very valuable resource.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:53):**  And I hope that we can find and put links for all of those as they pertain to different  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:24:58):**  regions if you haven't been able to find them wherever you are.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:02):**  Let's get now to a question that always comes up eventually when we're talking about creating  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:07):**  as resilient and diverse ecosystems as possible and still managing the necessity of efficiency  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:13):**  and ease of work for the business side of things.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:17):**  I mean, you can't just have one of every different plant scattered all different and wild in  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:22):**  an ecosystem and hope to have an efficient and profitable business.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:26):**  How do you reconcile those things in your own business model, keeping in mind that you're  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:30):**  not selling to a commodities market for for weight values, that you have a very different  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:36):**  business model for your orchard?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:37):**  Yeah, that's actually people have commented that's probably the biggest contribution of  
**[0:25:44-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:44):**  the permaculture orchard model is to be able to have diversity like we'll typically have  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:25:52):**  five different cultivars of apples and three of pears in a given role, then some plums.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:00):**  So there's a mix of the trees through a row.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:04):**  Well how do you do that?  
**[0:26:05-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:05):**  How can you have a whole row with between 40 trees and 100 trees?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:13):**  How can you have that many trees and a diversity and still have some kind of logic to it?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:19):**  So we call it the grocery store concept.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:22):**  And it's the same idea as you walk in a grocery store.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:26):**  It's not all one thing in that grocery store aisle.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:29):**  There's a whole bunch of things.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:31):**  So what we do is all we have to know is when is that crop harvested?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:38):**  Well within apples we can harvest from the end of July to the end of October.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:46):**  We've got cultivars for that whole season.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:49):**  So how can we reconcile that?  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:51):**  We just need to know if we want to put blue permain.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:54):**  Well blue permain is harvested from middle of October to the end of October.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:26:59):**  So we divide each month into three 10-day windows.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:02):**  And then those windows we say okay it's the beginning of August till the 10th of August.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:09):**  That's early August.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:10):**  Then we have the middle of August which is the 10th to the 20th or 11th to 20th.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:14):**  And then 21 to 30 that's the end of August.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:19):**  Now in those three periods in August if we have five cultivars of fruit that are going  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:24):**  to harvest we need to know where do they fit in that window.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:29):**  And then we just plant that and we try to have enough that we can fill a whole role  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:33):**  at that date.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:35):**  So that makes it easy.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:36):**  And I don't pick the fruit mostly.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:38):**  I mean I don't pick much at all.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:40):**  We pick a little bit for a little kiosk.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:43):**  Most of it is people coming and that's everybody who picks has to be a member of the farm so  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:48):**  we get paid in advance.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:50):**  And then whatever they pick they pay for as well.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:54):**  And so it's a U-pick model with that diversity.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:27:57):**  Well actually for U-pick it's the best model because when we had 11 calls we got enough.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:07):**  What else do you have?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:08):**  I didn't have anything.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:10):**  So now when they come and they can pick 40 or 40 kilos of apples and 10 kilos of pears  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:16):**  and then they'll pick up you know two kilos of plums.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:19):**  Oh and you still have herbs.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:21):**  Oh great.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:22):**  Oh look at there's still some small berries.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:24):**  Yes we'll get that too.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:26):**  Oh and you have some vegetables in there.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:28):**  And the nice thing I mean if you have vegetables that you don't have to harvest that's fantastic.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:35):**  Like why not let people pick what they want.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:39):**  You know we give ourselves so much work for nothing and harvest is don't make it light  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:47):**  of it.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:48):**  And if you have harvested that is a big job.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:52):**  And in all fruit productions because I used to teach fruit production and we'd look at  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:28:57):**  the ag economics of each of the crops.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:00):**  And an average right across the board for fruit is 40% of the cost of producing that  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:06):**  crop is harvest and packing.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:10):**  And we underestimate packing but if you put fruit in a box that box is going to cost you  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:15):**  anywhere from let's say for us it's a dollar to a dollar fifty.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:21):**  Well if you sell that box for ten dollars and you got a dollar fifty in a box that adds  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:28):**  up pretty fast.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:29):**  You know that adds up fast.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:31):**  So 40% if you can bypass that.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:34):**  And when I teach in Europe I mean god I can't get it.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:38):**  I really can't get it.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:39):**  You guys have the perfect situation in Europe.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:43):**  You have population everywhere.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:46):**  Anywhere I go I've asked and only one place have I found somebody when I say do you have  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:52):**  30,000 people within 30 minutes of where you are.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:29:57):**  Everybody's like of course everybody has that.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:00):**  And one place in the center of France they didn't.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:04):**  But I was like for us it's normal.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:06):**  I'm an hour from a major city.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:10):**  An hour.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:11):**  That's way too far.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:12):**  And it still works for me.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:15):**  But in Europe the few places that I've heard that did you pick.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:20):**  They are crushing it.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:21):**  They're absolutely like they don't want to say it because it works so well.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:27):**  They're making so much money and they're saving so much money because they don't have to pick.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:33):**  And if people are going through the orchard and they see a nice rock and they go oh I  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:38):**  love this rock.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:39):**  I want to take this rock home.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:40):**  And they put it in their basket and you weigh the basket and there's a rock in it.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:46):**  You don't care if there's a rock in it.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:48):**  Like who cares.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:49):**  Do you want to take that rock?  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:50):**  Take the rock.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:51):**  You're paying for it you know.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:30:53):**  So that's where god I mean Europe I can't I can't believe how come you guys aren't going  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:02):**  crazy for you pick.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:03):**  You are in a better situation.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:06):**  Everybody knows about going to you pick.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:09):**  It's culturally established for a long time.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:11):**  But the first ones who do it in Europe let me tell you you will you'll be in people's  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:16):**  mind as going oh yeah go to Oliver's go there and you can get figs and pomegranate.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:22):**  I don't know everything else you can grow Oliver you know I mean.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:26):**  And then the more diversity you add the more people buy.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:30):**  To give you an example if we have two colors of plums we sell two times more.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:35):**  We had two kinds of raspberries two colors.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:37):**  They're both harvest at the same time.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:39):**  But we sell twice as much just because now there's two colors of raspberries.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:44):**  Like I don't care if people just want to give me more money I'm not against it you know.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:49):**  It's it really it don't make it more complicated.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:31:54):**  Focus on growing it and then make the make the harvesting people's problem.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:03):**  So for example right now because we're early and it was hard to schedule the dates early  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:08):**  in the season because I wasn't sure if we were going to continue to be early.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:12):**  But we were so I put dates one week early but in fact I should have put dates two weeks  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:17):**  earlier.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:19):**  And so we're getting caught with one type of apple that has produced a huge load.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:26):**  And so I'm going to have to have an open day that wasn't scheduled.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:30):**  And what I do is if I have a problem right now I have a problem we're going to be losing  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:36):**  like a few tons of apples if we don't pick these fruit.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:40):**  So since that's going to be such a problem I want to turn it to an opportunity.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:45):**  So we're giving away a box which is 18 kilos as a member.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:51):**  That box would normally mean $60 but membership costs $60.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:32:56):**  So people figure hey I can join as a member for free because I was going to pick these  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:01):**  apples anyway.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:02):**  And then every time they come I have something else free.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:05):**  Not always that valuable but there's always something free.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:08):**  Sometimes it's flowers sometimes it's herbs sometimes it's small fruit.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:11):**  Whatever is a problem to me whatever we have so much of that we're just going to lose I  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:16):**  give it away.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:18):**  Because I know that because they came for that one item like they saw that we're having  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:23):**  free apples and they came very rarely do the people come just for that.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:29):**  They'll they're there oh oh you have garlic today yeah we have fresh okay I'll take you  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:35):**  know $10 or $20 of garlic and oh you got to have eggs that's true I gotta get some eggs.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:41):**  So there's $20 of eggs and and so on and so on.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:44):**  So focus on producing focus on designing the system to be easy and if you use those grocery  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:33:54):**  store aisles people as they walk and they see the diversity they will pick more.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:00):**  It's it I mean I've seen both because I saw when we had just apples and you know 400 trees  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:07):**  of the exact same cultivar it that's worked for you.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:12):**  But when other people come and take care of that work it's it's it's really nice.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:18):**  Yeah I think that's a fantastic example especially like you said for the European context but  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:22):**  also for people who have smaller plots of land where you can put in a ton of diversity  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:27):**  that might be difficult to optimize and make really efficient for harvesting yourself or  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:32):**  might not make financial sense to bring in a team to do that harvest work that could  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:37):**  still serve as a community asset that is profitable for your context.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:41):**  I love those ideas.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:42):**  Now we're getting a little low on time and I still want to make sure that we have time  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:46):**  for listener questions but before we go into that can you tell us what you would give as  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:51):**  advice for people who are just starting out or who perhaps have tree systems already and  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:34:56):**  are looking to make a transition to a more whole ecosystem regenerative approach.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:02):**  I would say look look at the film we we did a film a few years ago the Permaculture Orchard  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:07):**  it's really a mini course.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:10):**  I would say start there because a lot of people got started just with that.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:14):**  That's all they had and they got started.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:16):**  Yeah it it gives you enough to start so knowing is one and then I never emphasize enough to  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:25):**  just do it like just start it it's not gonna it'll never be perfect.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:31):**  You'll always you know that's why permaculture principle of the feedback loop you do it you  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:37):**  try it you observe and you adjust and you make a change.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:41):**  So start small I say start with two trios that's like six trees and just start with  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:48):**  that.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:50):**  Learn because you'll learn as much with two trios as with 500 trees honestly you will  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:35:55):**  because you'll start see dynamics happening and that's that will be your feedback because  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:01):**  you have to be convinced.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:03):**  I can't convince you.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:04):**  You can hear me talking you could watch the film but you are not convinced like I was  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:09):**  not convinced.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:10):**  I wasn't sure this would work.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:12):**  You know he talks about this all of a sudden in his book but I wasn't convinced that that  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:17):**  would work until I did it and until I saw a few cycles of production and that's really  
**[0:36:24-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:24):**  the key is you have to see it and then be convinced and then it's then it's like okay  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:31):**  I want to do 10 times more no problem because you already have the foundation you know well  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:37):**  I won't put this plant anymore but I'll put more of this one and so that's where that  
**[0:36:42-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:42):**  that start and the feedback and yeah get the films for sure.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:50):**  There you have it a big thanks to Stefan for taking the time to share his knowledge and  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:54):**  experience with our growing farmer community at Climate Farmers.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:36:58):**  Remember that if you're involved in farming anywhere in continental Europe you can join  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:01):**  the network right away by visiting climatefarmers.org.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:06):**  And now I also promised to share with you the information on how you can come and learn  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:09):**  with me in person this October.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:12):**  This is the first announcement that I'm making on this exciting course that I've put together  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:15):**  with my friend and Centropic Agriculture Specialist Jacob Evans.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:20):**  I interviewed Jacob last season about his experience applying Centropic principles and  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:24):**  design to the challenging ecology of Andalusia in southern Spain and how even with the harsh  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:30):**  heat and bone dry conditions of the summers there that they face he was able to establish  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:35):**  an Eden of productive perennial crops and support species on degraded former farmland.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:42):**  Since that interview Jacob and I have been looking for ways to collaborate and so I invited  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:46):**  him to come and teach with me at the farm of a good friend of ours and climate farmers  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:50):**  Carlo and Coralee.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:52):**  The two of them have been developing their new orchard a few hours south of me from where  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:37:55):**  I live in Barcelona and are super excited to experiment with Centropic Agriculture for  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:00):**  all of the incredible benefits of mixed biodiversity and ecosystem services that it has the potential  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:06):**  to develop.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:08):**  Together we'll be hosting a group of learners for five days in which we'll not only go through  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:12):**  the principles and theory of how these systems work, we'll be putting them into practice  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:16):**  directly on the land as we install Centropic Orchard Rows on their site.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:21):**  I'll also be going into the practical side of ensuring that this innovative way of planting  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:25):**  matures into a profitable venture that can accelerate the development of your farm.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:30):**  We'll cover soil testing and plant health, seed saving and plant propagation, alley cropping  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:36):**  and animal integration and a whole lot more.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:38):**  There will be team building activities, incredible food from the surrounding community and much  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/stefan-sobkowiak-on-running-a-profitable-regenerative-fruit-orchard/#t=0:38:43):**  more in this five day intensive learning experience.

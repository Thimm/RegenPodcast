**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:01:27):**  May I have a guest with a truly remarkable story and journey into natural building?  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:01:32):**  Atulia Bingham is the author of Mudball and Mud Mountain, both of which cover her incredible  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:01:37):**  experiences moving to the countryside in Turkey and learning to build her own home with earthbags.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:01:43):**  She has also written numerous educational manuals on earthbag building, clay plasters  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:01:47):**  and much more, as well as blogging about her experiences.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:01:52):**  In this interview, Atulia talks about how she first moved onto her bare land in rural  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:01:56):**  Turkey after some economic struggles and learns to do without the comforts that she'd grown  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:01):**  accustomed to.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:02):**  We also go into detail about tons of natural building techniques including earthbag construction,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:07):**  applications of limecrete, the pros and cons of earthbags when compared to other earthen  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:12):**  building techniques, and much more.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:15):**  Atulia also talks a lot about her process and journey that many of you who are making  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:19):**  or have already made transitions in your lifestyle will certainly relate to.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:25):**  I also caught up with her as she travels around northern Spain and talks a lot about this  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:29):**  new transition of her own.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:31):**  So let me turn things over now to Atulia Bingham.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:34):**  Hey Atulia, what a pleasure to have you here today.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:38):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:39):**  Great, thank you, Olivar.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:41):**  How are you?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:42):**  I'm doing really well.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:43):**  I'm actually visiting family in the States, so I'm not in Guatemala this time.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:46):**  Oh, right.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:48):**  Which is normally where I live.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:50):**  But actually, so where are you calling in from?  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:52):**  Well, from Spain.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:54):**  Yes, I'm not in Turkey.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:56):**  Is that maybe why the timing was a little bit funny?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:02:59):**  But yeah, I'm actually in Spain at the moment.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:02):**  What part of Spain are you in?  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:04):**  I'm in northern Spain.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:05):**  It's stunning, absolutely stunning.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:07):**  Oh, man, that's one of the parts of that country I haven't seen before.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:10):**  I'm very jealous.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:11):**  Yeah, it's amazing, really mesmerizing.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:13):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:14):**  Well, we're going to get into some of your travels later in the questions, but how about  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:19):**  we start out by telling us a bit about your background and how you first found out about  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:25):**  natural building and earthbag construction?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:28):**  Right, well, I had no building experience at all.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:33):**  I thought I had no interest in building.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:35):**  I was a teacher and I'd been living in Turkey for about, well, back then it must have been  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:40):**  about 15 years I'd been there, maybe a bit less.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:45):**  And the reason I started was because I ran out of money, completely ran out of money.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:50):**  I bankrupted myself after a couple of very poor business moves and I had no money.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:57):**  And all I had left that wasn't collateral for a debt in some way was a piece of land  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:04):**  in southern Turkey, beautiful plot of land, but small, only a couple of acres.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:10):**  And so I moved up there.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:12):**  It was May, so it was coming into summer.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:15):**  And I moved up there in a tent just because I was exhausted, I was burned out and I couldn't  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:19):**  think what else to do, actually.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:21):**  And so I was there in a tent in a field with no power and no running water.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:30):**  And within a couple of weeks, I just began to transform and I started making little things  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:37):**  as you have to, to survive, camp-style things, making myself a little bathroom and then a  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:43):**  little kitchen and a little shade for the tent.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:48):**  And slowly but surely I became fascinated by building and I realized I loved it and  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:57):**  I'd just never really been introduced to it.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:01):**  That's why I thought I didn't like it.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:05):**  And it went from there and I stayed up there for eight months in this tent.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:10):**  And by this stage I'd become a wild woman.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:14):**  I was in love with the place and I loved the scorpions and I loved everything about it.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:20):**  And so I thought I was sure I was never going to live in a house again.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:25):**  I said walls are for losers, I don't need them, I love my canvas, this is my life.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:32):**  And then winter arrived as it does and a storm arrived and nearly blew me off the hill basically  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:43):**  because the storms there in winter are pretty big.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:47):**  I'm not quite as bad as you have been having over there but nonetheless it was a pretty  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:53):**  big storm.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:54):**  And so I realized the tent just kind of leaked everywhere and I was left huddled in the tent  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:00):**  with my belongings and I thought I have to have a house.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:05):**  And why did I choose earthbag?  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:09):**  Well I'd seen a friend of mine had built these little earthbag structures and that was the  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:15):**  first person who'd ever done it in Turkey.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:18):**  And I'd seen them and I'd been talking to him sort of about three or four months ago  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:22):**  about these structures and he'd said oh it's so easy, anyone can do it.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:28):**  And I decided that I wanted a roundhouse and I could see from my land that I had a lot  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:34):**  of decent earth, I could see that, that was clear, I already knew that.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:38):**  So it made sense to make something from mud.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:42):**  And so I gave it a go.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:43):**  So hang on one second, what do you mean by decent earth, what are you talking about there?  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:49):**  Yeah you need, for earthbag building you need about 25, 20, 25% clay content is optimum  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:56):**  really and that's exactly what it was, it was sort of 20% clay content.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:00):**  So when you've got that.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:01):**  I see a ready mix batch, that's great.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:03):**  Yes it was incredible.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:07):**  And so all I needed to do was use that earth in the bags and when you wet, you put the  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:13):**  earth in damp and then when you tamp it down it forms a solid sort of clay earth brick  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:19):**  that when it dries becomes just like concrete really.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:23):**  Fantastic, now I know you've written extensively about all of this in your book Mudball and  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:27):**  in your blog as well, but could you tell our listeners about the steps that you took to  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:31):**  start to build your own earthbag house?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:35):**  Yes well first of all I called my gardening help man, Jalal, who was my right hand man  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:42):**  in all things garden and construction because I still didn't, I really didn't know anything  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:47):**  to be honest.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:48):**  I mean really I hadn't even put a shelf up when I moved on that land.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:53):**  That's the state of greenness that I was about building.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:59):**  So he came and I said Jalal we're going to make a house and he said yeah we told you  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:05):**  you should make a house months ago and I said yeah we need to get moving and he said you're  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:11):**  right, winter's here.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:12):**  What are we going to do?  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:13):**  He said make a hut, I know how to make huts.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:16):**  I said well actually I want an earthbag house and he just looked at me.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:22):**  He's like what?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:25):**  And I told him what to do and I showed him how we were going to do it and so we started  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:30):**  by measuring, well we started by drawing a circle on the ground as to how big we wanted  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:37):**  the house, digging about a half metre trench for the foundations and filling that with  
**[0:08:44-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:44):**  rubble and stones and then I got the bags shipped in from Istanbul and it's incredibly  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:54):**  inexpensive because I really had no money, I mean very little money to do this with but  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:59):**  I still managed because it's such a cheap method to use.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:03):**  All you need is the earth and the bags and some barbed wire.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:06):**  That's sort of, I mean you obviously need wood for your door frames as well and for  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:10):**  your roof.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:11):**  It's a very, very expensive bit but you can get a house up very, very cheaply with this  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:15):**  method so we got the bags in and then we started laying.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:20):**  The first two layers we made a stem wall with gravel filled bags which was excellent because  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:28):**  although it's a very dry climate in the summer, in winter it floods a lot.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:32):**  There's huge rainfalls that happen and that gravel foundation, the rubble trench foundation  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:40):**  with the gravel stem wall worked a treat, it really did.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:44):**  My floor was bone dry all the time and then after that we filled the bags up with the  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:53):**  earth mix, the clay earth which was just the earth mix.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:57):**  Yeah, can you talk about that a little bit?  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:59):**  So for those who are unfamiliar with earth bag construction, what sort of bags did you  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:04):**  use?  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:05):**  What are the bags filled with and how did those walls start to go up?  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:07):**  Right, well there's two kinds of bags that you can use and the most natural method would  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:13):**  be to use burlap bags for sure and I used polypropylene bags for two reasons.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:18):**  A, I couldn't find decent burlap bags in Turkey.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:21):**  B, if you're in a damp climate with earthquakes which is what I was in, the bags can rot,  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:29):**  burlap can rot so I needed to be sure.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:33):**  I mean I've sat even in that house through four earthquakes and when you're in an earthquake  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:39):**  zone like Turkey you want to know that your house is not going to fall on you.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:43):**  So that was always in the back of my mind.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:45):**  So I used the polypropylene bags and then you asked about how, what was the next question?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:52):**  Sorry, about how the wall went up.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:54):**  Exactly, how do you start stacking them and what sort of keeps the layers together?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:00):**  Right, so there's a method, you sort of fill the bags up a little way and then you have  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:07):**  to kind of crush the earth down in them so they get a nice square bottom and then you  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:12):**  fill the rest of the sack up and then you fold the sack up just like a parcel and lay  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:17):**  it on the ground and you go round like that in a circle so they're all squashed in and  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:23):**  once the circle's complete you get a heavy block of wood or whatever, something flat  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:29):**  and smooth and heavy and you go round and tamp, it's called tamping, tamp all the bags  
**[0:11:35-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:35):**  and that squashes the earth flat and creates this solid clay earth brick and then on the  
**[0:11:43-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:43):**  top of that you will run two layers, two rows of thick industrial strength barbed wire and  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:53):**  that's what's holding all the bags together, that's what's holding the layers together  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:58):**  and that's the tensile strength of the building, that's what stops it falling apart in an earthquake.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:02):**  Oh, marvelous, okay so that's your bond in between where perhaps with Adobe they would  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:07):**  use mortar, it's the wire that's giving the friction needed.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:13):**  Yeah and that is why, I love Adobe, I'm certainly not knocking Adobe or Cobb actually but that's  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:21):**  the difference, that's why Earthbag outperforms every other building method for earthquakes,  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:27):**  that's why.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:28):**  Yeah, yeah, it's broken or nearly broken the shape tables, they have to stop using the  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:36):**  shape tables because the structure is just holding.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:39):**  You're kidding.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:42):**  Now, I know you mentioned that you filled the bottom layers of the bags with gravel  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:48):**  and used that as your foundation, do you know of all the types of foundations that are available  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:52):**  for Earthbag housers?  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:54):**  Yeah, you can, I mean the rubble trench, I always really recommend the rubble trench  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:59):**  foundation no matter where you are, it's an excellent, it's the sort of basic original  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:07):**  foundation method that we always used to use and it's perfect for wet climates, it just  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:12):**  does the job but if you mean the stem wall, you could fill like the bags with other things  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:20):**  such as, for example, limecrete would be a great example and another very good, well-performing  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:28):**  material in the damp and I don't personally recommend concrete at all, people do do it  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:34):**  with concrete and I've been in Earthbag houses with concrete foundations and they're always  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:38):**  damp because concrete holds the wet.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:42):**  This is natural building, earth-based building and mainstream construction with concrete  
**[0:13:50-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:50):**  and iron are two separate methods and the materials don't go together, it's quite difficult  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:58):**  to get this home to people sometimes, you know, concrete doesn't really mix very well  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:03):**  with earth because it holds the damp and then of course all that damp wicks up into your  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:08):**  wall which you don't want.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:09):**  So, limecrete on the other hand gets rid of water very, very fast, that's what it does,  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:15):**  it just sucks up all of, sorry, it doesn't suck up, it gets rid of the water so it just  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:21):**  keeps it dry the whole time.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:24):**  Through the porousness of the material?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:27):**  Because it's breathing, yes that's right, because it's breathing whereas Portland cement  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:31):**  isn't exactly.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:33):**  So talk a little bit about how you've experimented with limecrete, some of the different additives  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:38):**  and such that give it stronger properties and if you could also explain what limecrete  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:42):**  is and how you've used it in your own building.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:46):**  Yeah, limecrete is so easy to use, I'm actually sort of baffled as to why people aren't using  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:52):**  it more, I think it's just because they don't know anymore, it's very, very easy.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:57):**  There are many, it's very complicated to get into all the different kinds of lime but basically  
**[0:15:01-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:01):**  you want a non-hydraulic or a kind of lime, you can get it in bags or you can get it in  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:10):**  a putty and the putty is better for plasters and the bagged type lime is often better for  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:17):**  things like limecrete but that's, there's a whole topic about that so I'm not going  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:23):**  to go into that, people have written books on it.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:25):**  Yeah, I teach that in my courses, perhaps I'll do a podcast sometime about the whole  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:28):**  lime cycle, it's pretty good.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:30):**  Yeah, it's quite complicated all the different types there are but anyway, you're going  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:34):**  to mix your lime with sand, that will give you a lime plaster and if you need a pozzolan,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:40):**  something like a burnt substance such as ash, brick dust, something which has been burned,  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:46):**  you can even buy pozzolans from construction suppliers and mix it into your lime, with  
**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:53):**  your lime and your sand and that pozzolan creates a reaction which makes the lime, limecrete  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:00):**  set really, really hard so yeah, that's how you make limecrete and how have I used  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:05):**  it?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:06):**  Well, I use, I came to the limecrete thing because I was, I was using mud for everything  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:11):**  and I used it as a mortar in my stone walls as well so I was using my mud plaster everywhere  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:18):**  but there were certain areas where it was failing, one of them was my back step, another  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:23):**  one was the sink because these areas were getting wet and they were getting a lot of  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:27):**  hardware and I needed something else so I started experimenting with limecrete and it  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:32):**  was brilliant, it was, I was just banging my head as to why I hadn't done this earlier  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:36):**  because it's so easy, I just used ash from my stove with sand and lime, mixed it all  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:42):**  up and it was great, you can add other things as I said like brick dust, marble dust, also  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:49):**  create really nice results with it.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:51):**  Fantastic, now let's flip it a little bit and here's, if you could tell me a little  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:56):**  bit about what some of the drawbacks or difficulties when building with earthbags are.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:01):**  Yeah, the difficult part about earthbag building is that it's very labour intensive, you want  
**[0:17:08-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:08):**  a motivated team and you need, we did it actually with four or five people, my own house and  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:18):**  it took about six weeks which isn't too bad but we were only really working three or four  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:25):**  days a week because that's all we could manage because we're getting tired but it is tiring,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:30):**  it requires quite a lot of lifting of earth so it is quite labour intensive, I'd say that's  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:38):**  a major drawback, I can't really think of another one.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:42):**  Fair enough, now I know that one of the things that confounds people the most when it comes  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:47):**  to earthen building is how to integrate windows, doors, shelves and sometimes even attach the  
**[0:17:52-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:52):**  roof securely, how have you had success integrating these features into your own house?  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:59):**  Yeah well, with earthbag you have to anchor it in and it's actually quite simple once  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:06):**  you've got the basic concept behind it, you can do it with everything, everything has  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:12):**  to be anchored into the wall and so it pays to plan which I'm not very good at but anyway  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:19):**  it plays to plan before you start because you're going to need to know where everything  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:25):**  is going to go on the wall.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:27):**  What do I mean by anchoring?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:28):**  Well, you need to have, usually use pieces of wood which you would slot between the layers  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:35):**  of earthbag and they would have barbed wire going nailed onto them so that the earthbag  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:40):**  is squashed onto them and those pieces of wood act as anchors that later on you can  
**[0:18:47-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:47):**  bang window frames into or door frames into and the same goes for the roof, you lay wooden  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:56):**  anchors all over the roof and then nail those anchors into the bags and barbed wire them  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:04):**  and then you can have something to bang your roof into.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:10):**  It's a bit difficult to explain without seeing it, I must admit it needs an example or a  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:14):**  photograph.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:15):**  Yeah, no certainly and I go over this a lot in the courses that I teach too, doing dead  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:19):**  men and different ways of anchoring things into dissimilar materials.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:24):**  It's a bit of a challenge if you haven't done it before and diagrams certainly help but  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:28):**  I think you did explain that quite well.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:31):**  Now I know that you've also incorporated a lot of off-grid features into your building  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:36):**  mostly out of necessity like you were talking about in the beginning, you didn't have access  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:39):**  to running water and electricity.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:41):**  Could you go over some of the success and challenges with things like composting toilets,  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:46):**  lighting, water and access to other amenities as well as anything else that you'd like to  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:51):**  address during your time living out there?  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:55):**  Yes, composting toilet was brilliant.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:58):**  It's so easy to make.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:01):**  I even have one in my van now, I'm travelling now in a van, I've even made one in the van.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:05):**  They're so easy to use, so easy to make.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:08):**  So composting toilet I'm a fan of.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:11):**  Yeah, I've been converted, never go back.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:15):**  Lighting I found also, solar power is also very easy to use, great.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:20):**  The only troubles with solar power is when you're, I mean I was a very tiny off-grid  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:25):**  system and I didn't have many appliances and I wasn't really bothered about it because  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:30):**  I'm alone and it didn't make any difference to me.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:33):**  If you had a big family and you needed huge fridges and washing machines and you want  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:38):**  all those modern things, then conveniences, then you need obviously a much more elaborate  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:46):**  expensive system.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:47):**  But I was very pleased with my solar power system.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:51):**  I only had two panels and two batteries and that was it.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:55):**  That was kind of enough for me.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:57):**  Can you give us an idea of what you were running off of that?  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:01):**  Yeah, not very much.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:02):**  Computers, lights, the small stuff, all the small stuff plus the only big thing I was  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:07):**  running was a little fridge but it wasn't running particularly well.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:13):**  Although that's because I was in Turkey and I couldn't get hold of, now I'm sort of in  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:19):**  Europe at the moment, you can get amazing sort of fridges that you can run off solar  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:23):**  that work really well but mine wasn't a solar fridge so to speak.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:28):**  So it was using far more power than it should have done.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:31):**  So did you even have to convert your 12 volt DC to AC power to run any of those?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:37):**  I was running, yeah, I had an inverter that was changing the 12 volts to 240 volts and  
**[0:21:44-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:44):**  yeah, that's pretty much, except for the lights, the lights were running off the 12 volt system  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:51):**  direct from the battery but everything else was running through the inverter.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:55):**  Sure, how about water?  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:58):**  Water was the nightmare and that's the thing.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:04):**  In the end I connected, after two years I connected, it was cheaper to connect.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:10):**  That was the reality.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:13):**  Because we had five months of the year with no rain so I was collecting rainwater from  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:18):**  the roofs and for three months it would sort of rush down a stream and I tried to collect  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:25):**  all that water into pools but it was okay.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:31):**  I had just about enough for my own personal use but trying to grow things you need a lot  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:36):**  of water and when you know you have five months of the year you're not going to get a single  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:39):**  drop of rain.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:42):**  And then you get a puncture for example in your pool or it leaves a tap on or it was  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:48):**  a big headache.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:53):**  So that I found incredibly difficult and that's what this time, because now that's what I'm  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:57):**  doing looking for a new piece of land, that's the key thing.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:02):**  Water, nothing else matters.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:05):**  The power thing is not, I mean there's so many options for power you could have wind.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:09):**  I know people with wind power systems as well, it's very easy to generate power but water  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:15):**  you can't generate it, you need it.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:19):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:21):**  Were there any other amenities that you managed to sort of make for yourself or have substitutes  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:26):**  for while you were living there?  
**[0:23:31-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:31):**  Well, I made, because the fridge wasn't working very well, in the end I found it was better  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:41):**  to use the old clay, what they call a zieh pot fridge but that would only work in a very  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:48):**  dry climate which I was sort of in except for the winter time and it didn't matter in  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:52):**  the winter anyway because it was cold.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:55):**  That worked.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:56):**  Any other amenities?  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:57):**  I can't think of any now.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:59):**  No.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:00):**  Well, the land cooling system, yes I suppose, I created a sort of little microclimate which  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:06):**  I was quite proud of and it worked really well.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:11):**  Once I got connected, it wasn't very big, a small pool of water which was just in the  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:19):**  shade at one side of the land and I got the idea from Iran where I'd seen these wind chimneys  
**[0:24:25-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:25):**  where they would suck in the air over a cold pool and they'd use that to air condition  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:32):**  the house.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:33):**  We sort of did the same thing with the land on a bigger scale and it worked.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:37):**  It made a huge difference, just this little pool of water in the shade, got very cold  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:45):**  and then retained that coolness throughout the day and changed that climate.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:50):**  So yeah.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:51):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:52):**  Yeah, a little bit of landscape engineering.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:55):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:56):**  Now, I want to echo something that you touched on a little bit earlier in the conversation  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:01):**  and that was the roof.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:03):**  You were saying that it was by far the most expensive part of the building and I know  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:07):**  that's been true of a lot of other earthen buildings that I've worked on.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:11):**  What sort of roof system did you take on as your first project?  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:14):**  Because that's a lot more technical sometimes than just stacking earth bags.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:18):**  Yes, and that was the part where I didn't sleep for at least a week with that roof.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:27):**  And yes, you're absolutely right.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:29):**  That's the technical part and that's the part where really you should be a carpenter because  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:33):**  it's a roof.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:35):**  So I chose and I would advise anyone else to choose the same was an earthen roof.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:45):**  So it was a sloping roof.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:47):**  All I had was the joists running flat across the roof.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:51):**  So there was nothing particularly difficult about that.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:56):**  It wasn't like a reciprocal roof or anything.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:59):**  It was just joists running flat across the roof with about a 10 centimeter raise at the  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:05):**  front so that the rainwater could obviously drain off the roof.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:10):**  And I made an earth roof.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:12):**  It was actually, yeah, although I worried about it and I was panicked about it.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:17):**  I'd say it was one of the foundations in the roof were the most successful part of the  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:21):**  build interestingly enough.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:22):**  And I'd definitely do the same roof style again.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:25):**  I loved the earth roof.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:26):**  I thought it was fantastic.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:30):**  Insulative, it was soundproofing.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:32):**  I really, really liked it, yes.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:35):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:36):**  Now again, another thing that you touched on a little bit were the types of bags that  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:40):**  you selected.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:41):**  So you went with polypropylene, correct?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:43):**  Yes, that's right.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:45):**  And those hold together a little bit stronger, but there are some other drawbacks to them.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:49):**  Could you touch on that?  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:51):**  Well obviously they're not completely natural.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:53):**  That's the drawback.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:54):**  It's a type of plastic.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:55):**  It isn't a type of plastic that's toxic and it isn't a type of plastic that leaks into  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:00):**  the earth.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:01):**  It's also breathable because they're woven together.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:04):**  Otherwise the earth would not dry in the bag.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:07):**  So it's breathable and people often think, oh, well, hang on.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:11):**  If it's plastic bags, it's not breathable, but it is because the bags themselves have  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:16):**  to breathe in order for the earth to dry.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:22):**  But yeah, the disadvantage is that they are not natural and they are not degradable.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:26):**  Well, they will own sunlight, but in your house they're not going to degrade.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:30):**  However, I thought about it quite a lot.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:34):**  And the amount you use of this, when you're talking about a house, how much did I use?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:40):**  About half a meter square of polypropylene?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:44):**  It's not very much when you consider how much concrete you would use for the same structure  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:49):**  or another thing.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:51):**  So I was sort of, you know, this is a house, you can live in it forever.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:56):**  You're using half a meter square of polypropylene.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:59):**  It's not, I don't know.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:00):**  I weighed up the pros and cons with that and that's what I chose.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:06):**  Considering it sounds like that's one of the only non-natural materials you use that's  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:10):**  extremely good.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:12):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:13):**  I think it's, whatever you do, at some point we are changing the environment.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:21):**  And you've just got to weigh up and balance your pros and your cons.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:27):**  Of course.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:28):**  Now did you ever come up with any troubles with the solar degradation of that plastic?  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:33):**  I know I've struggled with that using different types of polypropylene and different applications  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:37):**  in the past.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:38):**  Yes.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:39):**  And in sunlight, in direct sunlight, it degrades incredibly quickly, especially if you're in  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:45):**  a hot climate like Turkey or if you were in, for example, Arizona or somewhere like that,  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:50):**  you know.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:51):**  It's going to, yeah, you need it covered.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:55):**  We built our house, as I said, at the beginning of winter.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:59):**  So the sun wasn't high in the sky and so it wasn't really getting affected.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:04):**  I still covered the bags and I still protected them with a shade cloth.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:08):**  That's enough really.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:09):**  That will do the job.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:11):**  On another house we built, on a workshop, it was in the summer that we did it.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:16):**  We constructed a shade over the building site as we built so that the bags were not seeing  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:22):**  that sunlight.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:23):**  But you want to plaster as quick as you can, really.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:26):**  That was probably better for your work environment, too, in the summer in a hot climate when you're  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:31):**  doing manual labor.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:32):**  I've done that plenty of times and I know how much of a difference a shade can make.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:35):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:36):**  Oh, yes, exactly.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:37):**  I think everyone would have fried it.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:41):**  Protecting the skin and the plastic, nice.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:43):**  So what benefits or drawbacks have you observed with earthbag construction when compared to  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:49):**  other earthen building methods such as Cobb, Adobe or Rammed Earth?  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:54):**  Benefits and drawbacks, right.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:56):**  Cobb, Adobe, Rammed Earth, yes.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:58):**  Well, as I said, the main benefit of earthbag over those methods would be its durability  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:06):**  in terms of earthquakes, its strength, its structural strength.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:10):**  Another aspect is the speed at which you can get the shelter up.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:15):**  Cobb, Adobe and Rammed Earth, all of them need each layer of the earth as you go round  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:22):**  has to dry before you can get to the next layer.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:25):**  So it's a slow process.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:27):**  I think they say it takes at least a year, maybe two, to get a Cobb house up.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:33):**  Whereas, as I said, the earthbag, I got it up in six weeks and that was not knowing what  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:37):**  I was doing.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:38):**  In my own experience, it really depends on the climate, much like you were talking about  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:44):**  as well.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:45):**  I've done Cobb buildings in two months in the past.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:49):**  Have you?  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:50):**  Yeah, but then we're in Senegal.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:52):**  Right, right, right.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:54):**  So it's just drying every day and then you go back the next day and build on it.  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:58):**  Yes, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:59):**  We could often build in the morning, allow it to dry over lunch and build again.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:03):**  That's how fast it was.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:04):**  Right, you see, and I've seen it in the UK and you can imagine.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:08):**  Yeah, UK is probably not the easiest place.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:12):**  That's where it'll take a year, for sure.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:17):**  What else?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:18):**  What are the other advantages?  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:22):**  Or disadvantages?  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:23):**  Yeah, the disadvantages.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:26):**  It depends what you want to do.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:29):**  Cobb and Adobe are lovely if you want to go slow and take your time and you've got the  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:35):**  time and they're even cheaper because you are really just using mud.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:41):**  That's all you're using.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:43):**  That's it.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:44):**  In terms of ease and skills, I'm not sure that there's too much difference.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:52):**  They do seem similar in that way, yeah.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:54):**  Like I said, it's one of the few earthen methods that I actually haven't worked on myself.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:58):**  I was very eager to speak to you about this.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:04):**  I don't think there's too much difference in terms of what you have to learn.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:12):**  My experience is more with earth plasters, but with Cobb you do need to know you're getting  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:16):**  your mixture right, otherwise you don't have a stable structure.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:20):**  But yeah, I'm not sure they're more technically different.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:28):**  What have been the most rewarding or unexpected benefits of building your own earthen house?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:39):**  Oh, there's so many.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:43):**  It's very addictive.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:44):**  I mean, everybody I speak to who's built their own home has the same comment.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:48):**  Yeah, I can definitely attest to that.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:50):**  Yeah, it's addictive because you feel so empowered.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:54):**  You take earth and very, very inexpensive materials and you create a home.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:01):**  It's an incredible feeling that you live in and that shelters you.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:07):**  Then you really realize what a con the rest of the building world is.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:15):**  I mean, that people are spending their entire lives paying mortgages to live in a house  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:22):**  and you've just built it in a few weeks maybe even.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:27):**  It was very empowering.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:28):**  It also really unleashed my creativity and that's why I think it becomes addictive because  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:36):**  this feeling of wanting to create beautiful structures because you can make them so beautiful.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:41):**  You can do whatever you want and after you've done one you start to see the possibilities  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:46):**  of others.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:47):**  It really gets going.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:48):**  Yeah, I myself come from a conventional construction and engineering background and yet I was really  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:55):**  drawn to not only of course the natural materials but like you said the creativity allowed in  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:00):**  it and just how empowering it is for people who like yourself before getting started had  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:05):**  no experience in the construction trades and you realize that you can take control of one  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:10):**  of the fundamental needs that a person has.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:13):**  Yes, and actually that was something that on that land when I moved on to that land  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:19):**  in a tent that became very clear to me.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:23):**  There's sort of people think about survival as being food and water and actually food  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:29):**  isn't your top priority.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:31):**  You can go a long time without food.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:33):**  You know, if you had to you could survive weeks with very, very little food but you  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:39):**  cannot survive a night if it's a bad night and you do not have a shelter.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:45):**  You cannot survive.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:46):**  If it's a hurricane you're dead.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:49):**  Right.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:50):**  Well, there's that rule of threes, right?  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:52):**  It's 30 days without food, three days without water and three hours without shelter obviously  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:58):**  depending on the conditions.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:59):**  Right.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:00):**  Right.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:01):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:02):**  It sort of gives you a bit of an idea of the hierarchy there.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:04):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:05):**  I think the... have experienced that and that's why the expense that building is now  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:14):**  and that people have to spend so much money on that very basic need feels to me very wrong.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:20):**  It's okay to charge lots of money for things that people don't need.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:24):**  Then they can choose but a shelter, people don't have a choice in that.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:31):**  To me that was the most empowering thing.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:33):**  I suddenly feel rich even though I had nothing.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:36):**  I suddenly started to feel rich because I realized that I could just build houses.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:42):**  It's wonderful.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:43):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:44):**  It also really helps you to prioritize exactly what it is you need in your life as far as  
**[0:35:50-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:50):**  comforts and amenities.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:52):**  It seems like you realized pretty quickly that having perhaps hot water for a shower  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:57):**  wasn't the most important thing.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:59):**  Maybe a lot of other amenities.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:02):**  Yes.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:03):**  Yes.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:04):**  It became more or less important.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:06):**  Yes, that's so true.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:08):**  It's been so long now that you sort of get used to things and you don't realize how you've  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:15):**  changed.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:16):**  That, yes, and it's stayed with me.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:20):**  The things that I thought I needed, I realized I didn't need at all.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:26):**  I realize now that I need other things which other people think they don't need probably.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:31):**  I need now, for example, nature and peace and quiet to me are like fresh air.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:38):**  I would happily sacrifice them for cold, for hot water just as you said.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:44):**  I realized I didn't really need hot water.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:46):**  No, it's absolutely right.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:47):**  You can find ways of getting around nearly everything.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:50):**  I didn't have a washing machine.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:54):**  You get really good at hand washing.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:55):**  For example, you just get skilled in other areas.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:58):**  You don't have to repair all these machines that keep going wrong.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:02):**  It's not your problem anymore.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:04):**  I don't know.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:05):**  I think we've made our lives more difficult.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:08):**  I lived for a long time without any hot water or many of those amenities.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:12):**  Now even when I have them, I don't bother to use them.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:15):**  I just become accustomed and that's what I prefer.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:20):**  I remember at one point wanting to go and wash my clothes.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:24):**  It was sort of at the beginning and thinking I needed to go and borrow somebody's washing  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:28):**  because I had something heavy to wash.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:31):**  I remember going to this person's house and I remember having to sit there.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:34):**  There was a little old lady in the village.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:37):**  They were being kind.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:38):**  I remember just sitting there thinking, oh, it would have been so much easier just to  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:44):**  wash them myself because I had to sit there for two hours and have this painful conversation.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:50):**  I could have just washed them by hand.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:57):**  It would have been done in 15 minutes.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:06):**  I know you've actually now moved out of that original mud home that you built and you're  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:10):**  traveling in search of a new base.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:13):**  Could you talk a little bit about what inspired you to move and what it is you're searching  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:20):**  for now that you have renewed priorities?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:24):**  Yes, I fell in love with that piece of land.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:32):**  It changed me.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:33):**  I never ever thought I would leave it.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:36):**  I very much thought I would die there.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:40):**  Then suddenly I began to get messages that maybe I should be moving on.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:50):**  I didn't pay them any attention really.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:52):**  I sort of really resisted.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:55):**  I didn't want to move.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:57):**  Then my neighbor, and I only had one neighbor that really was on my border, she gave her  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:07):**  land to her children and they bulldozed right up to the boundary.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:13):**  They were going to put a house there.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:16):**  It all changed for me because it had been my secret little world where you couldn't  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:21):**  even see the house and there was no proper road down.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:24):**  It was very, very secluded.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:25):**  You could only really walk down or you needed a jeep.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:30):**  No one ever could see me.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:31):**  No one ever got there.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:36):**  It changed it for me.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:39):**  At the same time, a friend of mine was hunting for land.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:44):**  He was in Portugal and Spain.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:46):**  He started sending me photos of the land.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:49):**  I just looked at it and I felt something sort of pop inside me.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:56):**  I also at the same time started imagining building another house.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:01):**  This is what I mean about this thing becomes addictive because as soon as I started thinking  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:06):**  about building another mud house, I became very excited at the thought of it.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:11):**  Oh, I'm just the same way.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:13):**  Yes.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:14):**  You just come up with all these different design ideas.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:16):**  I'm like, oh, how can I integrate that feature?  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:19):**  Exactly.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:20):**  I had never been to Spain or Portugal.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:24):**  I'd lived in Turkey for 20 years.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:26):**  I didn't know that I would like it or not.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:28):**  I still wasn't sure.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:31):**  Of course, I loved that land and I couldn't give it up.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:34):**  Then a number of things happened one after the other and I really felt I was being kicked  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:38):**  out.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:39):**  We had a forest fire that came very close.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:43):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:44):**  I saw those pictures on your blog.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:45):**  That's why.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:46):**  I thought I'd actually lost the house.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:50):**  We evacuated and I assumed that was the end of it.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:52):**  I remember cursing at the time saying, why didn't I sell the land?  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:57):**  Now it's just a chart heap.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:00):**  It didn't.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:02):**  The wind changed at the last minute and it absolutely changed direction.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:07):**  You could see a line of where the burnt trees were.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:10):**  It was very strange.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:14):**  Then I started to think, you know what?  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:16):**  Things keep happening.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:18):**  Maybe I need to put my land.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:19):**  Maybe I do need to sell it.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:20):**  Then of course there was a military coup within a week.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:27):**  I put the house on the market straight.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:30):**  It can be a motivating factor for children.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:37):**  Within a week, it sold actually.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:41):**  I felt like it was sending, saying move on, move on.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:46):**  Now I arrive.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:51):**  I got a van and I've been traveling around looking for places.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:55):**  What am I looking for?  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:57):**  Well, really one of the things which was upsetting me very much about where I was and one of  
**[0:42:02-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:02):**  the lessons I learned is that even though I was so independent and so I really didn't  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:08):**  need much from the outside at all, some things were still affecting me.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:12):**  It was affecting me, for example, that people were hunting animals on my boundaries or it  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:19):**  was affecting me that people were using pesticides on their crops and it was filtering into me.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:25):**  It was affecting me that generally there was no sort of environmental protection for any  
**[0:42:34-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:34):**  of the forest land around so you could see the government really were just going to wreck  
**[0:42:43-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:43):**  it all.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:44):**  It was obvious and I just didn't want to watch it.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:47):**  What I'm looking for now is a place which is more protected, I suppose, and where the  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:55):**  people around me perhaps resonate more with my own ideals, I guess.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:00):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:01):**  Now, before I let you go, could you tell our listeners how they can find your books, your  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:07):**  blog and perhaps get in touch with you to follow your travels?  
**[0:43:12-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:12):**  Yes, I've got it all on www.themudhome.com.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:22):**  Everything is on there and there's a lot of free materials which I know people benefit  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:26):**  from.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:27):**  There's an earthbag building PDF there which I show exactly how I built my house.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:33):**  It's about 22 pages, I think, of pictures and explanation.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:36):**  You can download that and there's also an earth plaster.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:40):**  I've now got an earth plaster PDF and mini course as well which you'll see it all on  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:44):**  that site there that you can sign up for.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:47):**  They're all free.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:48):**  My On The Road blog is also on that site where you can follow my journey and see where I  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:56):**  end up.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:59):**  My story, Mudball, is an author.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:03):**  That's really what I started out wanting to be.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:08):**  I've now become both and I love them both.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:10):**  I'm a natural builder but I am also an author.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:14):**  Mudball is my most popular book and that is the story of that house building adventure,  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:20):**  six weeks in Turkey with not much money and no experience.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:27):**  That's a popular book and you can find that at www.themudhome.com as well.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:34):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:35):**  If I can add my two cents, I really have benefited a lot from those resources that you've put  
**[0:44:38-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:38):**  out there.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:39):**  I love your book.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:40):**  I subscribe to your newsletter and I follow your blog.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:43):**  I just think what you're doing is really empowering and remarkable.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:47):**  Thank you for putting that out there.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:50):**  Thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:51):**  It's really nice of you.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:52):**  Thank you.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:53):**  This has been fantastic and I really hope that we can reconnect.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:56):**  I would love to see where you end up finding land and who knows, maybe we could even work  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:00):**  together in the future.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:01):**  I know I've got a lot of friends in Spain.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:04):**  I love that area.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:05):**  It sounds like you're traveling through areas I haven't seen before but are really high  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:08):**  on my list.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:09):**  I'm learning Spanish now so Guatemala could be on the horizon.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:13):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:14):**  We're doing a lot of projects there too.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:19):**  It's such a fun process.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:20):**  I really enjoyed learning Spanish.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:22):**  Of course, it's an ongoing learning experience, of course.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:27):**  I'm sure you'll get a lot out of that as well.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:31):**  Again, thank you so much for taking time and let's stay in touch.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:36):**  Thanks, Oliver.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:37):**  Very nice to connect with you.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:38):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:39):**  You take care.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:40):**  Bye-bye.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:41):**  So, before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:46):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:50):**  Goodsy.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:51):**  Hey buddy, what's new?  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:52):**  Oh man, so much is happening.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:55):**  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:58):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:02):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:04):**  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:09):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:10):**  As you know, we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:15):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:18):**  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:24):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:30):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:31):**  Honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward, man.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:37):**  That's life changing.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:38):**  But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:44):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one  
**[0:46:49-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:49):**  of our intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:51):**  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I  
**[0:46:57-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:57):**  know of available anywhere.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:59):**  Basically with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:04):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:09):**  That's what I'm excited about, man.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:11):**  But yeah, what about you?  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:12):**  What's going on?  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:13):**  Man, well, you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:17):**  season as well.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:18):**  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:24):**  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:27):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:32):**  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:35):**  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:40):**  methods for years and years to come.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:43):**  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:47):**  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:52):**  Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:55):**  And honestly, this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things  
**[0:47:59-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:59):**  too.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:00):**  This little town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala, like right  
**[0:48:04-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:04):**  here on the shores of Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:05):**  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:08):**  On top of that, you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich  
**[0:48:13-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:13):**  and alive.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:14):**  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:20):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:24):**  I mean, within walking distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:29):**  on.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:30):**  We've got the projects that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:33):**  centers, you have Charlie Rendell's Natural Bamboo Building School, you have Love Probiotics,  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:38):**  you have Fungi Academy, and honestly, loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:44):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happened.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:47):**  Yeah, man, it really does.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:48):**  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:52):**  sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:54):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:55):**  Give us a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:59):**  I mean, all food and lodging in the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:03):**  the tuition, so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:07):**  That's a great idea.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:08):**  Because I mean, people can still take just one course if that's what they're into, or  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:11):**  if they can't make the full two weeks, but this will actually make the two courses more  
**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:16):**  accessible to even a wider audience of people.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:19):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:23):**  want to do.

**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:26):**  Alright, thank you guys so much for joining us again on another regenerative roundtable.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:30):**  I am joined here with one of our usual suspects, Neil Haggerty.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:34):**  Hey Oliver.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:35):**  He's seen me all day today already and is clearly over it.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:39):**  And so excited about it.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:42):**  And we're here with one of our good friends from the next community over in San Marcos,  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:47):**  Tim Rer.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:48):**  Hi there, good afternoon.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:50):**  And today we're going to be talking about some new subjects that we haven't touched  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:53):**  on yet, especially the coffee industry here in Guatemala.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:02:57):**  But before we get too much into those topics, I want to give a shout out to a friend of  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:02):**  the show who sent us a really kind message and I just wanted to read it here for everybody.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:07):**  Greg Kale wrote in.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:09):**  Hello there.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:10):**  I just wanted to tell you guys how much I enjoy your podcast.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:12):**  It is so great to hear positive, hopeful content on environmental issues.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:17):**  It's easy to get overwhelmed and feel disempowered by the news and politics.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:20):**  So sources like yours are a great counterweight.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:23):**  I especially love the regenerative roundtables.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:25):**  Hearing differing opinions on the merit of techniques and their trade-offs is fantastic  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:30):**  and really unique.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:32):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:33):**  It has me cheering for the farm and I hope it all goes well and your goats do great.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:38):**  And Greg Kale.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:39):**  So thank you so much, Greg.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:40):**  We really appreciate it.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:42):**  Yeah, thanks, Greg.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:43):**  Lovely message.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:44):**  And so now we're going to jump into talking about some of the projects that we've been  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:47):**  working on in the past weeks since you heard from us last.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:51):**  So Neil, do you want to tell us about what's been going on here on the farm development?  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:55):**  Yeah, sure, Oliver.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:03:57):**  I guess I've been focusing a lot on fertility actually.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:04):**  So trying to put in systems that are easy to manage and kind of like our plan to make  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:10):**  the garden just become very fertile for like, you know, cut down, I guess, increased impact  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:18):**  and cut down work.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:19):**  But so what I mean by that is like have a bunch of systems in place that make the work  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:26):**  put into the garden highly beneficial because, you know, I don't have time to be in the garden  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:30):**  all of the time.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:33):**  So you know, we planted a corn system, a milpa system a couple of months ago, and I noticed  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:38):**  that it was like not doing that good.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:40):**  And I hadn't really had that much time to be paying attention to the garden.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:44):**  So milpa system obviously being the corn bean squash, the sort of famous Mayan combination  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:49):**  of plants that work in symbiosis together.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:51):**  But you know, I noticed they weren't doing that well, even though we put in like some  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:54):**  compost.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:55):**  But remember, we're like this our first year in the garden.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:04:58):**  And you know, we're also building a house and putting in all of our other systems.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:01):**  So the garden is kind of like looking a little sad.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:04):**  So I started to get going on doing some like bio-ferments and really like trying to make  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:10):**  the soil alive because we've got our big animal system now.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:13):**  We got our chickens in.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:14):**  We got like 10 Criollo or heirloom chickens and about 55 laying hens.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:21):**  So we had to think of a system for feeding them.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:25):**  And this is all, you know, this is all related to fertility, but I had to think of a system  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:28):**  for feeding them.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:29):**  And one of the things we started doing was fermenting corn in our way.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:33):**  So anyone out there who has either goats and or chickens, I really love some feedback on  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:40):**  this one because essentially my idea is that if I can cut down the need for soy based concentrates  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:48):**  by giving our animals locally or easy to source things.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:55):**  So a big part of our diet comes from like there's a local ashram down the road from  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:05:59):**  us and we give them, we started taking their food scraps from them.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:02):**  So we give them that in the morning.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:03):**  But then with that, we mix in a couple of handfuls of corn that's been fermented in  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:09):**  our way.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:10):**  So we take our way, which are byproduct from the cheese that we make with the milk from  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:14):**  the goats.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:17):**  And we ferment the corn in that and then we mix the way in with the rest of the food and  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:21):**  we give it to them and they they've been lapping it up, you know, and then we give them a little  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:24):**  concentrate to supplement their their feed in the evening, but that that whole system,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:29):**  that whole that whole chicken system, they're kind of it's a composting chicken system.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:33):**  I'd really recommend anyone who doesn't know that what that is to look it up and watch  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:36):**  Chad's video on YouTube.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:39):**  So to go in along with that, we started to brew microorganisms, which we've been like  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:44):**  blasting in there with water and kind of like turning or picking up the ground underneath  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:49):**  there.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:50):**  We built our chicken house adjacent to our goat house.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:52):**  We have this kind of herbivore follow is followed by omnivore sort of set up going on where  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:06:57):**  the chickens kind of go in and clean it clean it out.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:01):**  Then we started doing these bio ferments, bio fermented fertilizers, where with the  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:06):**  sort of aim of re-mineralizing our soils, we're going to put a put a video on it.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:11):**  The good news is the garden has responded amazingly with just like a couple of weeks  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:15):**  of doing this stuff.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:18):**  So you know, I'd be happy to talk more about these recipes, but I don't want to like overload  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:22):**  people.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:23):**  But we also set up here we did a lot to do with fertility.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:26):**  We also built a worm box with a rabbit hutch up over it.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:32):**  Also going to put our video on that within the animal house.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:35):**  So within one house, we have two types of chickens, rabbits, worms and goats, you know,  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:43):**  within a few months, and it's trying to get them all to work symbiotically along with  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:47):**  the microorganisms alongside of our garden.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:50):**  That's like, it's joining up those dots really is what I've been doing lately, you know.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:07:56):**  And tell us a little bit how we deal with what could have been a bit of a crisis as  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:01):**  we had one of our chickens poached the other night.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:04):**  Tell us how we kind of address that problem.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:07):**  Oh, yeah, like a little ferret or something got into our chicken house.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:12):**  You know, that that happens.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:14):**  It was like we have a house within a house, so essentially all we did was make sure that  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:20):**  there's a lot of places for the for the chickens to roost inside their little house.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:23):**  And we also just like spent a whole day basically like really shoring it up and making sure  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:28):**  that the animal if it got into the inner coop, because here's the thing about animals, I  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:33):**  guess the big thing for me about our system is our chickens aren't necessarily free range,  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:39):**  they will have access to the outdoors for sure.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:42):**  There are different fields that we can open them out to, but they are actually on top.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:48):**  The way we keep the ecosystem healthiest is not by rotating them necessarily.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:53):**  It's by continually putting more organic matter in there to keep them feeling like they're  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:57):**  on top of fresh ground.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:08:58):**  So they're essentially on one kind of 10 meter area or a little bit more of just a huge compost  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:08):**  pile.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:09):**  Eventually, that's full of the manure from the goat house, which is above their house.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:15):**  All of our kitchens grab loads of hay, loads of leaf litter.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:20):**  You know, it all just goes in there.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:21):**  It's sort of like the place kind of functions like a big a big stomach, you know.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:26):**  And then we're brewing the microorganisms so that what comes out of there is like is  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:31):**  fully finished and plant available.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:34):**  So we we just shored up the house within the house, you know, and this is like, you don't  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:39):**  need to be an engineer to figure this stuff out, you know.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:42):**  But it is dangerous.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:43):**  I will say this with chickens is if you notice one of them getting eaten, what often what  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:48):**  I've seen happen various times is like you notice one dies and then the next day you  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:53):**  come back and there's 10 dead because whatever got in there like builds up courage or tells  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:58):**  its friends or whatever, you know.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:09:59):**  So it's definitely one to nip in the bud.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:02):**  Yeah, some of those reactionary things are hard to plan for.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:06):**  I mean, a lot of the animal pen spaces kind of went up really quickly out of necessity  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:12):**  because we were getting the animals quickly.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:15):**  And then you have to kind of solve problems afterwards as they arise because you built  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:19):**  it a little bit slapdash the first time.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:22):**  But as Neil and I have talked about before, this animal system is something of a prototype  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:26):**  that we're testing out.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:27):**  So we did it very cheaply the first time.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:29):**  And we're going to be tweaking with the systems and kind of renovating the structure as we  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:34):**  figure out the way that the animals want to interact with it in order to make as much  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:39):**  fertile compost as possible and keep them happy, healthy and well fed and producing  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:44):**  milk, eggs and meat in the case of rabbits.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:48):**  So to give you a little update now on the house and how that's going over the last couple  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:52):**  of weeks, one of the main things that we focused on is putting in the floors on the first level  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:10:57):**  inside of the residence portion of the house.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:00):**  Now I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with lime and the cycle that it goes through from  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:06):**  being burned, then being slaked and being transformed into two different states of hydraulic  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:12):**  lime and then slaked into.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:18):**  Man I always forget the scientific names for these things as they get down in different  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:22):**  stages.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:23):**  But basically you have Orecalza, which is the dry powdered lime here in Guatemala and  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:30):**  lime putty which stays wet and then you can use it in mortars and plasters.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:34):**  So we use that in place of cement to lay what are called lajas or slate tiles down on our  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:41):**  floor.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:42):**  Now that seems like a luxury item in many places around the world but we're fortunate  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:46):**  enough that just over the hill in a different valley these slate tiles come straight out  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:51):**  of the mountainside and they're very affordable as a result and make for a really beautiful  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:11:57):**  aesthetic floor with kind of a undulating feeling of natural stone.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:03):**  And so most people install those with cement which obviously works just fine but sticking  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:08):**  with our natural building theme and the fact that we haven't yet used any cement anywhere  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:13):**  on the house we decided to make our mortar out of pure lime.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:17):**  So the process takes a little bit longer.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:19):**  We actually slaked lime ourselves which is when you add water to it and it goes through  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:23):**  a chemical process turning back into limestone slowly as it reabsorbs carbon dioxide after  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:29):**  the burning process.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:31):**  I mean that might be a little bit more dense a science than most people need but if you  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:35):**  ever are interested look up the lime cycle online and there's great animations and resources  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:42):**  to figure out how it interacts at different stages of mixing.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:46):**  So it takes longer to make a good mix.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:48):**  We kept mixing and hydrating the lime for almost a week before we formed it into putty  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:53):**  and put it down as the base for our floors.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:56):**  And then similarly it takes a long time to dry.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:12:59):**  So my floor was finished being installed about five days ago and the mortar still is a little  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:07):**  bit pliable it's a little bit plastic like you can press a thumbprint in it if you put  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:12):**  in a little bit of pressure.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:14):**  So the longer curing process is a little bit of a deterrent for people if they're trying  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:18):**  to move in quickly but we're trying to take our time and use the best materials possible.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:23):**  So that is the biggest thing that's changed in the house we've made a couple of design  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:26):**  considerations and changes as well but we're almost ready to start moving on to the finish  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:31):**  work.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:32):**  So if anybody is interested in seeing the progress of the farm and the house you can  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:36):**  follow us on Instagram or Facebook where we're regularly posting pictures of what we're developing  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:41):**  here on the farm and projects that we do for clients.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:44):**  Now before I get too far into just our own projects Tim has been sitting here patiently  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:50):**  while we catch everybody up.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:53):**  So Tim can you start us off by introducing yourself to our audience telling us a little  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:13:58):**  bit about your background and then we can start to talk about the coffee industry here  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:02):**  in Guatemala.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:04):**  Hi everybody.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:05):**  Yes my name is Tim.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:06):**  I am from northern Europe.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:09):**  German Danish border to be precise.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:11):**  Founded up here in Guatemala about like eight years ago.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:16):**  Put down roots here after traveling the world for a few years.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:20):**  And I needed something to do, an income.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:24):**  So in the end I stumbled upon the fact that the coffee grown here was only shipped out  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:29):**  and not processed here in the village where I live.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:34):**  And so the farmers would hardly make a living and the people living here would not even  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:39):**  be able to drink the coffee grown here.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:42):**  That's how I got to coffee and how I got here to Guatemala is to extend the time we have  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:48):**  here.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:49):**  So tell everybody about your business model.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:51):**  How long have you been roasting coffee and what is the social impact that you're hoping  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:55):**  to have with your business?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:14:58):**  Well coffee of course being from northern Europe always had a fascination with just  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:02):**  there's a culture of coffee drinking up there where I grew up.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:07):**  And when I bought land here I found coffee growing on the land.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:12):**  And of course I was interested in processing my own coffee and to be able to drink it.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:19):**  And over that I learned how this is all done and how coffee is being grown and how the  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:24):**  locals deal with it.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:27):**  So I started that eight years ago.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:31):**  And in the beginning I would have to carry the coffee, the fresh harvested coffee to  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:36):**  a neighbor like a quarter mile away to have it pop there which is taking the outer flesh  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:40):**  the skin off.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:42):**  And then carry it back up the hill to the place to process it there and then carry it  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:46):**  to another village to have it hushed and roasted.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:49):**  And the outcome was never satisfactory to the way other people dealt with my product.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:55):**  So I decided to go independent and make it a thing.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:15:58):**  It was meant to be a hobby in the beginning more like you know maybe I'll be processing  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:02):**  roasting coffee once or twice a week and then look for a real job.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:06):**  The demand became so high that I invested in better equipment and refined the methods  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:13):**  and now we're processing in an artisanal professional way.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:19):**  Yeah it's cool.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:20):**  I feel like a lot of people maybe don't understand the implications of... because coffee growing  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:28):**  sort of with a lot of the permaculture community here or at least yeah I'd say like quite a  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:33):**  lot of people who have who are into these kinds of things like food sovereignty and  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:38):**  using local plants maybe don't see what a useful crop coffee is because even though  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:43):**  it's not native and it's not food it's a shade tolerant crop.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:50):**  It can be sort of incorporated into kind of a diverse agroforestry system.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:16:56):**  You know I just wonder if you had any thoughts on that.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:00):**  So coffee first of all originates in East Africa area known as Ethiopia today and it  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:08):**  was taken here to Guatemala by German settlers who came here to Central America to specifically  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:14):**  to grow coffee because the climate here which is a tropical highlands is the same as in  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:20):**  where coffee originates from.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:21):**  So the natural circumstances, the climate and the altitude are perfect for coffee growing.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:29):**  These are Arabica strains we're talking about here.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:31):**  So Arabica strains here as in its origin are grown in the mountains as Neil said in the  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:37):**  shade which means under other trees.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:43):**  And then here at the lake where we live the locals started growing coffee maybe like also  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:49):**  like 50 or 80 years ago as a cash crop.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:54):**  And so here the Mayan farmers unfortunately traditionally they do use pretty much what  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:17:59):**  we would call slash and burn for their corn growing and also with the coffee they would  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:06):**  you know deforest partly.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:10):**  Our aim now with the knowledge that we have and permaculture knowledge is to get the coffee  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:15):**  growing that exists here and make it more sustainable because the coffee does have the  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:21):**  potential.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:22):**  There has been recently there's been a really bad plague the coffee rust that destroyed  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:28):**  pretty much a quarter if not half of Guatemalan coffee crops.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:33):**  It's been really bad and because it's a global commodity even though if the Guatemalan farmers  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:39):**  have a bad crop as long as Brazil and Vietnam and other big producers pump out huge amounts  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:45):**  the global coffee price remains the same.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:49):**  So usually on a free market you know if a farmer has a bad crop then the price would  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:55):**  go up because there is.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:18:59):**  Yeah like that's part of I guess that's part of the strange thing about the way global  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:04):**  commodities work right it's like the suddenly how long like 15 years ago the sort of NGOs  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:12):**  start to promote coffee growing in Vietnam and you know like 10 years later they become  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:17):**  one of the biggest coffee producers in the world and this has like huge implications  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:21):**  that affect Guatemalan farmers on the other side of the world and it's like this it can  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:27):**  look like quite a strange system at times right.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:30):**  Exactly so trying to rescue coffee growing here means numerous things.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:38):**  First of all there needs to be initiative for the farmers of course to grow it again  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:41):**  it needs to like they need to be able to make a living off it at times.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:46):**  Yeah because that's the thing I mean sometimes it's literally not worth your while to harvest  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:50):**  your coffee right now right.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:52):**  Yeah there are times when the prices are so low that you know picking some people don't  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:19:56):**  even pick their coffee anymore because here it's all done by hand there is no machines  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:00):**  involved it's all on on steep mountainsides a lot of the coffee fields the farmers have  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:05):**  to walk half an hour hour up to two hours up into the mountains pick it bring it back  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:09):**  on foot you know and then they make like really couple dollars like the whole day that's obviously  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:14):**  not worth it.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:15):**  So since there is a speciality coffee market you can actually achieve higher prices for  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:21):**  your coffee if you know how to grow it.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:24):**  Here also the traditional farmers they have little education and little knowledge when  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:29):**  it comes to soil chemistry and and things like that and because here chemical fertilizers  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:36):**  they actually being given away for free here during election times sponsored by some northern  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:42):**  American country I believe.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:46):**  Let's keep politics over this.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:48):**  It is a political thing actually so you know they they don't quite understand what's so  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:53):**  bad you know if you put chemical fertilizer on it and you have twice the crop they don't  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:20:58):**  see how that can be a bad thing first only after 30 years when all the salts are depleted  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:03):**  obviously you know the problems become apparent and things like the coffee rust come in because  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:08):**  the salts are not healthy.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:09):**  So it really takes a complete rebuilding at this point.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:14):**  Because I buy directly from the farmers it's direct trade from small producers that really  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:18):**  have a tenth of an acre some maybe half of an acre that's about the size of the fields  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:24):**  that the private farmers you have the little plots and it's from those people we buy directly  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:31):**  and you know we commit of course to a fair trade system we actually pay 20 percent more  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:36):**  than they would get on the street and we guarantee a minimum price so if it's like completely  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:41):**  like the global market prices completely collapse we still guarantee a certain minimal price  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:46):**  and we then process the coffee and sell it really only locally we don't export we're  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:53):**  not looking into export we're trying to keep the coffee that is grown here and through  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:21:59):**  that direct trade system and cutting out a bunch of middlemen and whoever else is making  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:04):**  money in the coffee market on the global market they are basically all left outside and so  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:09):**  we can pay more and still achieve like a competitive you know be able to to sell for a competitive  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:15):**  price on the local market here.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:17):**  Which you know for me living around here that that's great and it's it's better than it  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:22):**  might appear at first glance because if those if people start abandoning their coffee and  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:28):**  it starts switching over to or they start looking for other cash crops you know the  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:33):**  types of things people are planting are corn you know maybe beans chickpeas annual basic  
**[0:22:40-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:40):**  grains that that denude the slopes that where the loss of soil is enormous and you know  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:48):**  coffee has because it's shade tolerant and because you can grow all these nice you know  
**[0:22:55-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:22:55):**  native trees like like heirloom avocados like ice cream bean jocotes you know all these  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:05):**  lovely big tall trees that will last for 50 60 years and shed loads of leaves you know  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:12):**  you create habitat for animals you keep your soil in place it's if it's done properly I  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:17):**  think it can be actually having a shade tolerant cash crop in your food forest is actually  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:23):**  pretty great you know.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:26):**  So I guess this leads me to the next question is how do you see some vital steps taken to  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:32):**  improve the industry as it currently is into one that is sustainable.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:38):**  Well first because I kind of like stumbled upon this whole thing without studying before  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:43):**  I myself need to you know learn what it takes actually to produce a high quality coffee  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:49):**  how to grow it that it becomes a high quality coffee how to process it how to roast it in  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:54):**  the end and then there is a lot of marketing to it.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:23:57):**  So we did the first steps we established a business that was making a name for itself  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:05):**  and from there on we need to upgrade and find the market also of people that are actually  
**[0:24:12-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:12):**  interested in high end coffee and are interested in or willing to pay for it as well.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:20):**  For example you have the coffee growers in Kona in Hawaii.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:23):**  Kona is a region in Hawaii and only the coffee grown in that region can be marketed as Kona  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:28):**  coffee there's a coffee growers association there and while we achieve about five dollars  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:34):**  a pound of roasted coffee on the market they achieve 50.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:39):**  Is it 10 times better than ours?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:41):**  I'm not so sure.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:42):**  For sure twice as good still because we're still learning.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:45):**  Yours is good man we're drinking already know it's good coffee there's no way it's 10 times  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:48):**  better.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:49):**  Exactly so the rest is marketing.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:52):**  So it's all about getting people together it's about understanding the potential and  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:57):**  then the growing methods.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:24:59):**  So I know that in Kona of course they have they have watering systems so in a drought  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:03):**  they actually have drip systems to give the coffee plants a sufficient amount of water  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:08):**  to keep the quality while here where we have a drought up in the mountains you know well  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:13):**  then the coffee isn't that good that year and that's that.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:16):**  So you need to think of it on along those lines and then teaching of course permaculture  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:23):**  and organic growing methods.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:26):**  I think these like you know I'm only fooling around with it now but partly what got me  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:30):**  into it was reading up I'd been doing on the rust and what causes it and exactly like you're  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:34):**  talking about these these these alkalines or these acidification of soils and loss of  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:41):**  microbial life and sort of like leaching and demineralization because when the pH of the  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:47):**  soil changes a bunch of the minerals and nutrients become unavailable so you know these bio-ferments  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:53):**  that I'm doing I learned about them from a Colombian guy called hydro-restrepo and they're  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:25:58):**  used in a lot of things they're great for your garden as well but you know the research  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:03):**  on them is that with the coffee rust they're like a very effective control against the  
**[0:26:10-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:10):**  rust so you know like I think it's gonna take it's gonna take a lot of like our own experimentation  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:18):**  being people who are from this part of the world actually because it's not really like  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:22):**  there's just a product out there that you can get easily and apply to this thing you  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:28):**  know these are like you know different people wherever they are need to find their own little  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:33):**  mixtures and composts and and in sumos you know inputs that they can add that are like  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:39):**  organic and actually improve their soil year on year instead of like leaving it stripped  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:43):**  like the like the chemicals do right yeah it's it's about educating and building trust  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:49):**  I mean we're in a part of a world where we have a history of 500 years of colonization  
**[0:26:55-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:26:55):**  of exploitation and you know the Spaniards came here 500 years ago to bring righteousness  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:03):**  over the indigenous and the missionaries came to bring you know the right faith and now  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:09):**  come these smelly permaculture guys bringing you know tell them try to tell the farmers  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:14):**  how to grow their corn and their coffee and they're kind of not very receptive to that  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:18):**  at this point so this is actually a big thing to work on this is to build this trust and  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:25):**  since we are all guys who ourselves get our hands dirty that's the first step to to gain  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:29):**  respect we're not just here in suit and ties and giving lectures but we're actually doing  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:34):**  it ourselves and and then showing that it's how it works and I know that the neighbors  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:39):**  they walk into their coffee fields and they walk past my little coffee patch and they  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:44):**  see it's full of coffee it's green it's lush it's healthy and they're like oh what are  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:48):**  you doing you know and and this is how you start yeah and what are you doing actually  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:27:53):**  well it's it's the low Neil just described it I'm I took I took over about a half an  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:00):**  acre of land and I will keep some of that some of course I build a house on and and  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:05):**  my coffee roastery and the production side and the rest I will keep some of it I put  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:13):**  vegetable permaculture gardens in working on getting chickens in and some of it I will  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:17):**  turn into a little food forest keeping some of the old strains alive because it's interesting  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:23):**  to keep some of those despite them being affected on the rust if you treat the soil and the  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:28):**  plants good enough they they can combat the rust the fungus and putting in new strains  
**[0:28:34-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:34):**  that are resistant I put in the first 25 trees this year of rust resistant coffee let's see  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:43):**  how that goes it's an experiment and then planting the food forest around there is a  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:48):**  tree here called cushion which only gives shade and the right amount of shade it's it's  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:53):**  kind of like a broad tree that doesn't make a dense shade because you don't want it to  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:28:57):**  be too shaded the coffee kind of like a 40 to 60 percent shade is kind of ideal yeah  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:03):**  it's amazing to see how those two in particular the coffee and the cushion just live in like  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:07):**  real harmony with each other and it's worth noting for you folks at home the cushion is  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:13):**  the ice cream bean or the inga it's commonly used in a technique called inga alley cropping  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:20):**  because you can you know it's one technique that they talk about being really good to  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:25):**  use in the tropics and subtropics because these things produce a ton of mulch you can  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:29):**  pollard them right back and they'll just grow back and they fix tons and tons of nitrogen  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:34):**  into the soil so you know like planting rows of these things and then chopping them back  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:38):**  for mulch so that they let go their nitrogen and they actually are pretty amazing trees  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:42):**  and have all kinds of applications but they also go really really well with just coffee  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:46):**  yeah the symbiosis between the cochine and and the coffee is specifically known there's  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:51):**  another tree that's seated itself actually in my coffee and a lot of coffee farmers use  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:29:56):**  it as a shade tree you don't know the local name for it at the moment but it just grows  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:00):**  really fast i planted a bunch of avocado trees there's the local fruit here the um jocote  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:08):**  which i have a couple of those old ones also standing around the coffee and that's also  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:13):**  a cash crop actually so it's i want to mix it up and have some some native fruit trees  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:18):**  the misballos here there's a native guava and you know just as much as diversity as  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:25):**  possible of course and having some benefits of like having avocados afterwards and but  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:31):**  keeping in mind that you know you're not trying to take get too much out of it you know and  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:35):**  have those cochine shade trees that take up a bunch of space but they're really improving  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:39):**  everything around them i mean another big yield for the locals actually is firewood  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:44):**  you know if if if i think most local people here if they can have a field that as you  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:49):**  say gives them a harvest of avocados and maybe one or one or two other fruit crops that they  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:30:54):**  can sell coffee that's actually good quality where the value gets added locally and they  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:01):**  don't get ripped off and firewood you know these things these trees grow really fast  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:06):**  and and all of the even the branches that fall off the trees that's a great bonus to  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:12):**  the local people to have those systems kind of well run and close by i think yeah of course  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:17):**  i have the benefit now of having lots and lots of um organic matter because of the coffee  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:23):**  processing there's first of all the pulp that when i get the coffee i do offer to all the  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:28):**  farmers who sell me their coffee that they can take their pulp home and then bring it  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:31):**  back to the fields so far they do not do that yet um so i composted i have a worthwhile casting  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:38):**  production going and i turn it back into soil put it my veg garden put it back to the coffees  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:43):**  um that that those huge amounts of organic fertilizer is of course a blessing yeah and  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:49):**  it's i think of all the organic byproducts i've seen worms they love it these guys go  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:31:55):**  crazy i haven't found anything that's good because it's actually like not that heavy  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:00):**  on nitrogen it's i think it's about 20 to 1 if i'm right if anyone's into composting  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:05):**  so it really doesn't need much dry material and worms just multiply like crazy in the  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:10):**  stuff and it's such a good ingredient to have then the other thing you there's two byproducts  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:15):**  to coffee the the shell you have it thrown all over your your food forest that's really  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:20):**  nice exactly it's the it's the husk that is so you have coffee has numerous layers it's  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:26):**  versus the pulp the the fruit skin so to say what you can eat also some people actually  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:32):**  interesting try to use this fruit skin to produce stuff from like they make some people  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:38):**  make flour from it they dry it make flour some make superfood drinks from it and i think  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:46):**  it's controversial because it's it's great of course the first first glance that you  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:51):**  use everything that comes with the coffee on the other hand living in between coffee  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:32:56):**  fields i know how important it is to compost the fruit and put it back into the coffee  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:01):**  because else how do you fertilize you need to substitute it then with other fertilizers  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:05):**  which here would be chemicals so it keeping it in the cycle i think is way more beneficial  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:11):**  than trying to market it so just before we get too far down the rabbit hole with all  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:17):**  of the different side processes of coffee could you spell it out for our listeners kind  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:21):**  of the entire life cycle and how you process it to get a finished product because i know  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:27):**  before i came here to guatemala i didn't realize just how many steps they were in the  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:32):**  process of planting harvesting processing and final product down to packaging and even  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:38):**  certain business considerations so now we're talking about here shake grown hand-picked  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:44):**  highland coffee as opposed to industrial industrial produced coffee which in your typical supermarket  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:50):**  vietnamese brazilian coffee and these countries also produce high-end coffees but the industrial  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:33:55):**  produced coffee is grown in lowlands big fields machine harvested machine produced i mean  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:01):**  i i don't even look at that kind of stuff here everything is grown in the mountains  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:06):**  as mentioned before so that you can't even access it with machines i'm so growing after  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:12):**  the coffee of course is ripe um the pickers actually go through every plot about four  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:18):**  or five times during one harvest season because not all the beans are ripe at the same time  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:22):**  um so this means the pickers um they they need to choose when they pick to only pick  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:28):**  the nice ripe beans and this is where it becomes important that you pay a fair wage because  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:33):**  they get paid of course by weight yeah so if they the more they pick the more they earn  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:38):**  um but uh i don't accept coffee that has too many unripe beans in it and for that i pay  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:43):**  fairly and i hope that it gets kicked down to the pickers then so um the first and most  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:48):**  important after you know it's grown properly in a good way is that the picker does a good  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:34:53):**  job um then we um we do a washed coffee so there are there are numerous ways of processing  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:00):**  coffee and this is all getting maybe a little too technical at this point um but uh so we  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:06):**  pulp the coffee which means we take the fruit skin off um then we ferment we ferment the  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:11):**  coffee about 14 hours um this natural bacteria is eating an outside mucus layer and um you  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:20):**  do start changing the molecule structure of the seed coffee is a seed yeah basically so  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:26):**  it makes the sugars later more available if you ferment it in the right way you don't  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:29):**  want to over ferment um but it does something for the taste if you do a good and proper  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:33):**  fermentation after that the coffee is being washed um the washing water that comes off  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:39):**  the coffee um at that point is actually something that neil and oliver will work on greatly  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:44):**  this year of turning this what we call um honey water uh turning that into a compost  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:50):**  tea and make it available again um to to the farming here around because it's highly potential  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:35:56):**  of course um so after the washing it's being dried out on a patio in the sun takes about  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:02):**  seven to eight days till it's dry um then that dry coffee has as mentioned before another  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:08):**  layer the the husk parchment that needs to be taken off it's a brittle dry skin that  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:14):**  is there around the coffee seed um that is we use for mulching afterwards um you couldn't  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:20):**  even use it in a compost toilet it doesn't absorb any moisture it's like really brittle  
**[0:36:24-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:24):**  um and then you have the the green seed which needs to be hand sorted still take bits and  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:32):**  pieces out um leftover husk uh broken pieces rotten coffee it's an it's a natural product  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:38):**  so obviously there's defects so you try to take it out and then the quality of the coffee  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:42):**  depends much on how fine you sort it um and after that we can roast it um roasting means  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:48):**  basically just heating it up when you heat up organic matter like no matter if it's coffee  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:36:53):**  or steak you get a browning which is the malnard reaction chemically speaking um and coffee  
**[0:37:00-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:00):**  is a seed so there's a high content of carbohydrates sugars basically um so if you heat it up caramelizes  
**[0:37:10-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:10):**  makes it brown um secrets of roasting it's it's all about how fast you heat up those  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:18):**  beans and in what way um if you heat them too fast it doesn't taste good if you heat  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:24):**  them too slow it doesn't taste good so this roasting is really an art form of knowing  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:28):**  your equipment knowing your seeds knowing your coffee and to get the most flavors out  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:33):**  of it and you can play with that you know you can you can the so-called roast profile  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:37):**  which if you put it in a diagram the heat curve you know if you adjust that in certain  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:41):**  ways you get different flavors out of it and um that's then the whole profession and the  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:46):**  fascination of roasting i welcome anybody who comes to go tomorrow come and witness  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:49):**  it it's great fun all right let's segue a little bit now to how the two of us in our  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:37:56):**  organizations are setting up to work together in the upcoming harvest season for coffee  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:02):**  could you explain a little bit how you're looking to expand and how you see our role  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:06):**  in helping out the coffee producers in our side of the valley so because neil and oliver  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:13):**  are having this little permaculture farm here they're looking for natural fertilizers organic  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:19):**  matter so because coffee production has the pulp and has as i described before this washing  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:25):**  water that would be greatly beneficial to that little farm here and i would like to  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:31):**  source coffee from this valley here for numerous reasons and so we're going to put in a little  
**[0:38:36-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:36):**  miniature processing plant here on the farm and then i will roast and market the coffee  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:44):**  so it will help the local farmers they will get paid better it will help the farm here  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:48):**  because they will have the fertilizers it helps me because i can diversify a little  
**[0:38:53-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:38:53):**  bit more and and at the same time these guys will help me get a grip on improving my processing  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:02):**  the the organic matter from the the coffee specifically the coffee water the washing  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:07):**  water the thing with the coffee washing water is it's if it's quite it's concentrated it's  
**[0:39:12-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:12):**  very concentrated and can be contagious we live here at lago at itlan in a very sensible  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:19):**  ecosystem the lake that we live at is is the word endemic there's no river going out everything  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:26):**  that goes in it's in it's like a cattle it's like a big bowl so you do not want to you  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:31):**  know have those wash waters go into that lake because it would lead to over fertilization  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:35):**  of that lake so it is it is mandatory also because it is a nature protected area it is  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:42):**  mandatory that these byproducts of coffee are being treated rightly and we're working  
**[0:39:48-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:48):**  together here with the environmental government and environmental agency and ministry and  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:39:55):**  they come actually and monitor what we do and we we want to prove to them that as small  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:00):**  producers we can take these these highly concentrated fertilizers that can be actually harmful to  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:07):**  the environment that we can turn them into something positive and that's that's something  
**[0:40:11-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:11):**  really fascinating and they're actually willing to work with us which is a it's a fantastic  
**[0:40:17-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:17):**  like a challenge essentially for a kind of permaculture designer here is to you know  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:23):**  invert that problem and turn it in turn all those all that potential matter out of place  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:30):**  into into a resource but you know there's a little bit there's a little bit more to  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:34):**  it it's great for me in one sense because it's like you're looking at all these people  
**[0:40:39-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:39):**  during the year walk past your farm with uh of course a sacks of coffee pulp or like coffee  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:46):**  beans on their head and it's like unpulped and everything and they send it to a town  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:50):**  that's 10 or 15 miles away where they depulp it and then all that pulp sits there in big  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:40:56):**  concrete vats not doing anything and you know you're like wow i'd love to have that but  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:01):**  you know it's the minute you you have it you're you got to do something with it so you want  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:06):**  to talk about what we're planning on doing yeah so it's important to note at this point  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:11):**  that we don't have all of the details worked out we have kind of a preliminary design for  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:15):**  this small processing facility that tim was just mentioning the challenge now is to figure  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:21):**  out how to process the byproducts in a way that turns them into an ecologically useful  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:27):**  product so like tim was mentioning the honey water has a ton of potential to be worked  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:32):**  into a very potent compost tea essentially and we're looking at different ways of either  
**[0:41:38-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:38):**  aerating it through a small pump adding other ingredients to increase its potency without  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:45):**  making it kind of a biohazard or retaining any potential of pathogens or bad bacteria  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:52):**  and then of course the pulp that he mentioned as well that would probably be a lot easier  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:41:56):**  for us to process because we have this four animal kind of compost factory system that  
**[0:42:01-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:01):**  we're still fine tuning as neil mentioned before the the worms love it the chickens  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:09):**  love it i'm sure we can find a way of passing it through them turning it into really rich  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:15):**  material and even using it to cut down on some of our own feed inputs that are coming  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:20):**  from outside yeah i mean also the microorganisms is one of the reasons we've got big into brewing  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:25):**  those is because they want really just a food source it's just like doing any other ferment  
**[0:42:30-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:30):**  so one of the things i'm really hoping to sort of engineer you know so any any volunteer  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:37):**  engineers out there that feel like coming and helping us with this they're more than  
**[0:42:40-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:40):**  welcome but you know some kind of system where those honey waters go down into to go through  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:47):**  a fermentation process i think that would be like the optimal thing and then essentially  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:42:53):**  work their way downhill through our property you know and if any of you out there find  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:00):**  this topic really interesting definitely follow our progress here on the podcast and on our  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:04):**  social media outlets because as soon as i have kind of a finished design for this processing  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:09):**  facility which we are kind of analyzing tim's own systems scaling it to the application  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:15):**  on our small farm and trying to troubleshoot some of the things that are in his processing  
**[0:43:20-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:20):**  facility which he thinks can be optimized or improved upon so as soon as we have a final  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:24):**  design for this i'll be sure to publish it and take feedback from people online as well  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:30):**  also just like with the feeding way to goats thing i'm would be delighted for any suggestions  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:37):**  feedback comments with anyone who's had experience in sort of similar things because you know  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:42):**  just like with a lot of these things we're we're making it up as we go along quite honestly  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:46):**  yeah it's true so the broader we can cast a net to bring in more information and expertise  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:53):**  we would love your feedback but that being said tim also has some fantastic experience  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:43:58):**  over the years that he's been here for and it's really fun to see this as a collaborative  
**[0:44:04-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:04):**  possibility between our two companies and have an environmental and economic sort of  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:12):**  positive impact on the communities where we live tim are there any other things that you  
**[0:44:17-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:17):**  would like to talk about about how moving forward with coffee production within these  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:23):**  valleys in the context that you mentioned the integration between coffee and agroforestry  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:29):**  systems can be a way forward to increase the economic benefits and the environmental impact  
**[0:44:34-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:34):**  for small scale producers well all in all it's this country is is changing rapidly from  
**[0:44:43-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:43):**  i think being like 70 to 80 percent people employed in agriculture that number is obviously  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:50):**  going down there's more and more people moving to the cities it's it's huge changes here  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:44:54):**  culturally guatemala is kind of like catching up to the 21st century while our towns here  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:01):**  25 years ago had no electricity no road access none of that people would you know live very  
**[0:45:07-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:07):**  simple rural life here and now you see flat screen TVs and cars and wi-fi and everything  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:15):**  you know without judging that's just the way things go and and so things are changing rapidly  
**[0:45:20-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:20):**  and the young generation is of course less and less interested in farming which i think  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:26):**  has the potential also of the ones that want to stick to it and are interested in it to  
**[0:45:30-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:30):**  try new things and and so we it's really it's pioneering it's everything is new here and  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:38):**  so it's it's all about working together with the new generation and trying to implant complete  
**[0:45:43-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:43):**  new things that are adjusted to the new circumstances around everybody here i think one of the things  
**[0:45:50-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:50):**  a friend of mine said this to me a couple of months ago and it stuck with me like the  
**[0:45:53-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:45:53):**  future of farming for the small guy is artisanal farming right we sort of know this you know  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:00):**  big coffee big corn big sugar none of that's not going anywhere and you can't hope to compete  
**[0:46:06-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:06):**  on that international market unless you sort of have a a product that not only is higher  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:13):**  quality but also kind of has a story behind it you know so you know for every like nice  
**[0:46:19-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:19):**  nice artisanal beer really top end artisanal beer there should be like an organic hops  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:26):**  farm behind it you know and it's it's like sort of the same with with coffee and i think  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:32):**  a little bit i i see interesting synergy between um you know the project we're doing which  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:38):**  is uh with that i'm doing with shad and athlete on organics which has to do with the community  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:43):**  uh reforestation project that we're doing which essentially what we're what we're focusing  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:49):**  on is avocado production because there's all these amazing heirloom varieties of avocado  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:46:54):**  from sununna from right here that are like totally unique different colored ones big  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:00):**  juicy ones and so we're grafting hundreds of those varieties right now and our volunteer  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:07):**  groups that are starting to come in to learn about agroforestry we're teaching them about  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:12):**  kind of permaculture techniques through bringing them to local people's land and you know planting  
**[0:47:18-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:18):**  small food forests with avocado as the main crop but with a bunch of support plants and  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:25):**  in a lot of these instances this was the case in our pilot project that system went in above  
**[0:47:30-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:30):**  um a coffee plantation you know so i think these and we also do like you know dry stack  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:38):**  walls and other soil and water conservation techniques so all these things we know can  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:44):**  help a lot in the in the production of coffee as an understory crop in those systems as  
**[0:47:49-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:49):**  well huh yeah and of course with with all idealism um the farmers around us um are um  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:47:57):**  they're poor you know people are poor here and um so cash crops are needed and and um  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:04):**  our of course job it is to to help the local farmers you know benefit from the cash crops  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:10):**  um but with without you know destroying the environment without the slash and burn and  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:15):**  without the chemical fertilizers and and to make people understand that if they want the  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:20):**  following generations to benefit from from the farming um they can't just you know kill  
**[0:48:25-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:25):**  the kill the soil um and this is where we come in is where we can actually bring some  
**[0:48:31-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:31):**  positive knowledge and and we need to keep in mind yeah they need to make a living so  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:34):**  coffee is actually a great connection there um you know because if done right it is it  
**[0:48:40-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:40):**  is a great cash crop and and it can be beneficial in a diverse um agroforest marvelous i think  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt6-1/#t=0:48:47):**  that's a good note to wrap it up here on now before we go tim could you tell our listeners

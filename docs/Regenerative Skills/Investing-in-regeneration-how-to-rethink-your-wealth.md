**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:08):**  All right, welcome back, everybody.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:14):**  Now, on this show, I've often taken a strong focus on the actions that we can all take  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:19):**  to restore ecosystem function and productivity, whether it be planting trees in an agroforestry  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:24):**  system, repairing the hydrology of a landscape, or building our homes with natural materials.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:30):**  And I've centered around these topics because, frankly, they're the ones that I have the  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:34):**  most experience with and I can speak about with some confidence.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:37):**  But there are also many other angles on regeneration that are equally important.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:42):**  Many of you will agree with me that, as essential as it is to get out there and work in nature  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:47):**  directly, planting trees, for example, is only useful if there isn't someone right  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:51):**  behind you to come and chop them down.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:54):**  Worrying about how ethically your food is sourced doesn't do much good when we still  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:01:57):**  waste a third of it.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:00):**  Oftentimes the harm of the industries and actions that we inadvertently support more  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:04):**  than undo the positive steps that we fight to take.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:07):**  That brings me to the focus of today's episode, which is on regenerative investing, and the  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:12):**  compelling story of Marco Vangelisti.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:14):**  My name is Marco Vangelisti and I'm a mathematician, came to Berkeley something like 35 years ago,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:21):**  and the first job I got is working for a company that was developing quantitative models for  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:26):**  the quants in Wall Street.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:28):**  We've long been told that we as consumers vote with our money.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:32):**  The decisions that we make about what to buy is equivalent to what we support and what  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:36):**  we want to see more of.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:37):**  But most of our daily shopping is a drop in the bucket compared to the amounts of money  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:41):**  being invested in speculative markets and commodity trading.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:46):**  This is the money that often determines the expansion of industries and new operations.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:50):**  It's the banking and investing sectors that are funding the destruction of our planet.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:55):**  But I'll let Marco tell you how and when all of this connected for him.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:02:59):**  Fast forward 20 years and I found myself working for one of those quants.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:04):**  We developed quantitative models to basically invest in emerging markets.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:09):**  We had a fund that was doing very well.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:12):**  In fact, we were the fund with the best track record over 10 years around the world among  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:20):**  the funds that were investing in emerging markets.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:22):**  And I remember one time, you know, we we had a spectacular year.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:27):**  Our portfolio went up 40 percent in one year and our clients, mostly endowments and foundations,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:35):**  were very happy with our performance.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:38):**  And then when I looked a little bit more closely at the portfolio, I realized one of the companies  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:43):**  that had the best return that year was a Malaysian palm oil company.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:49):**  That had destroyed tens of thousands of acres of forest in the Borneo and replace it with  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:55):**  a monocrop of palm oil plants.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:03:58):**  And they also got a lot of carbon credits that year because they were planting trees,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:03):**  forgetting the fact that they destroyed the forest.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:07):**  And so that was for me the moment when I realized that, wait a second, I have been contributing  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:12):**  money to those environmental foundations for their good work, protecting habitats of endangered  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:19):**  species around the world.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:21):**  And I was finding myself in my professional capacity, managing the same money and investing  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:26):**  it in a company that destroyed the very habitat those foundations were created to protect.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:31):**  That was disconnect.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:32):**  It's like, wait a second, what are we doing here?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:35):**  Right.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:36):**  So this basically revealed to me the extent to which financial returns are extracted,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:42):**  how a lot of finance operates from the principle of taking value where you can find it.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:49):**  And usually somebody else is paying for that value either either workers not being paid  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:04:55):**  enough or ecosystem being destroyed or other things like that.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:00):**  So that's when it left the finance industry and decided to take a big turn.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:06):**  Well, so let's talk about that turn now in leaving the financial industry, that was your  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:12):**  bread and butter and all the things that you had studied and become good at.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:17):**  That must have been a daunting personal experience.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:20):**  What motivated you to shift career paths and see that there were better options in front  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:25):**  of you?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:26):**  Well, at the time when I left the industry, it was not the prospect of a better option  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:30):**  that that made me leave.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:32):**  Right.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:33):**  Because I had no idea what I was going to do next.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:35):**  In fact, I don't know if you probably still remember 2009.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:41):**  It was a very difficult year from an economic standpoint.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:44):**  And leaving a very well paid job was not easy for me.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:47):**  But I simply said I couldn't be part of this anymore.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:50):**  And so when I left, then I really wanted to a understand the large systems.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:05:57):**  You know, how does the financial system work and why did we have the financial crisis of  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:03):**  2007, 2008?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:05):**  Turns out was due to the collapse of the shadow banking system.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:09):**  I mean, very few people know about banking, even fewer people know about shadow banking.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:14):**  And the next thing I did is I wanted to learn more about not only the systems, the largest  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:19):**  systems, but also how to change society.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:21):**  So I joined a bunch of movements, the Occupy Wall Street.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:25):**  I was one of the founding member of the slow money movement.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:29):**  I took a permaculture design certificate.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:32):**  I joined the transition town movement, the public banking movement.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:37):**  Right.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:38):**  So I was trying to expand my understanding of the world.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:41):**  And what one thing that I realized is that a lot of the people that want to change society  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:46):**  don't really understand some of the key.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:49):**  Consistent, like the money system, the banking system, so the financial system, and I realized,  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:06:55):**  wait a second, not everybody who's part of this movement have my training.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:00):**  You know, I spent 20 years in finance.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:02):**  I am an MBA.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:03):**  I started the monetary system and so on.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:05):**  And so I made it my task initially to share my understanding of those large systems with  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:12):**  the people that wanted to transform society.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:14):**  So that was at the time I was doing it mostly as a volunteer.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:19):**  I would speak to anybody who would listen.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:23):**  So that's how I started my effort called Essential Knowledge for Transition.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:28):**  It comes out of the transition movement and it's really understanding how the large systems  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:32):**  operate so that we can intervene and change them.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:36):**  What are some of the key concepts to understand to be able to follow what we're going to explore  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:42):**  later on in this conversation about how to invest regeneratively?  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:45):**  Well, a lot of people don't know much about money and specifically they don't know how  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:52):**  money comes into existence.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:07:54):**  If you ask people who creates money, they will either say the government, which creates  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:02):**  the metal coins in your pocket.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:05):**  Some people say that the Federal Reserve creates money, which is partially true.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:09):**  The Federal Reserve prints the dollar bills that you have in your pocket.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:13):**  But by far the vast majority of the money we use is electronic money created by banks  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:19):**  in the process of lending.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:22):**  When they loan money, they create the money they lend, and it's a little bit shocking  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:28):**  to understand, but a lot of people do not know that.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:34):**  And in part, money creation by banks is what affects the business cycle and financial crisis.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:43):**  The bank tend to lend in excess during good times and then refuse to lend in hard times,  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:50):**  therefore creating these big swings in the economy.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:52):**  So that's one thing that people understand.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:54):**  The other important point that people understand about investing is that they have a direct  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:08:59):**  impact on society and the ecosystems.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:03):**  I mean, I glimpse a little bit of that when I was looking at the portfolio and this company  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:08):**  that destroyed the forest in the Borneo.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:12):**  But there was a larger study published in I think was 2013 by the economics of ecosystems  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:20):**  and biodiversity.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:21):**  There's a group by the UN that try to quantify in dollar terms what is the dollar value of  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:29):**  the natural capital we're using every year in conducting our economic activity worldwide.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:35):**  And what they found is that every year we were using seven trillion dollars worth of  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:41):**  unpriced natural capital to subsidize really our economic activity at the time.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:47):**  You know, they looked at the year 2009 and at the time the GDP on earth was seventy five  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:55):**  trillion.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:09:56):**  So all the values of goods and services created worldwide was worth seventy five trillion.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:01):**  And yet we were taking seven trillions a year from the natural capital to subsidize that.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:10):**  And so that's one thing that people don't understand is a lot of the economic growth  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:13):**  is predicated on destroying the very natural capital on which our long term survival depends.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:20):**  And therefore, a lot of our financial returns are predicated on the same.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:24):**  In fact, the interesting thing about the finance system is that it extracted both from the  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:30):**  natural environment and from the economy.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:32):**  So for example, how could you have the economy shrinking in 2020 and the financial markets  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:38):**  go through the roof?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:39):**  Right.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:40):**  It's basically an expansion of that process of extraction.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:43):**  So those are the things that people usually don't understand.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:47):**  Money creates banks.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:48):**  Sorry, banks create money.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:51):**  You have a business cycle that is driven by credit creation by banks and also that our  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:10:56):**  investments are extracted and we extract a lot from nature.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:00):**  And kind of just a little side question here.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:02):**  Why do you think that we haven't put any kind of economic or monetary value on the ecological  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:08):**  services that we are destroying in order to subsidize the human economy?  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:14):**  Well, because nature does not pay us for that.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:17):**  I mean, have you received a bill from nature for pollination services?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:22):**  Right.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:23):**  Have you received a bill from nature for climate regulation, for, you know, soil fertility  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:30):**  building over the last 10,000 years?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:32):**  So, you know, you have a tree, you can cut it and sell the wood.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:36):**  It's a free resource for us.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:38):**  It only cost us the cost of extracting it.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:41):**  But nature built that over thousands of years and is not charging us a price.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:46):**  I mean, it will eventually in terms of probably, you know, potentially having a planet that  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:53):**  is not very habitable for us.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:11:55):**  But that's the ultimate price is not something that is conveyed to us in a dollar form.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:02):**  And unfortunately, you know, if you think about the indigenous population, the nature  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:10):**  of the land, the land is not a place to preserve it.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:17):**  And so they had basically a cultural way to preserve it.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:24):**  Once you introduce modern thinking and capitalism and so on, which you have is you have a process  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:31):**  of commodification of everything.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:34):**  Capitalism commodified both labor and nature.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:38):**  You have a dollar value on something that you can extract for free and nature does not  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:42):**  charge you for that.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:43):**  You're going to take it.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:45):**  So my neighbor is cutting down a tree.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:47):**  So you might actually hear noise.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:50):**  I don't think he's doing it for the lumber.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:51):**  He probably wants some more sunshine or something.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:12:54):**  But there is no price that nature, you know, charges us for taking a tree down.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:03):**  Well, yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:05):**  Like natural systems have no need for token currencies.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:09):**  The interactions and exchanges are based on much more tangibly valuable things and services.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:13):**  But let's switch focus now and look back into various forms of investing.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:18):**  Marco, you've created a classification that outlines different stages of ethical investing  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:22):**  based on awareness.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:24):**  Could you explain that?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:26):**  The way I like to classify investments are as follows.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:30):**  Most of the investments we make are unaware and possibly extractive.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:34):**  So if you don't know where your money is, chances are somebody else is paying for your  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:38):**  financial returns.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:39):**  So that's unaware and extractive.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:41):**  Then the next level is aware where your list know where your money is.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:44):**  And you can do that when you, for example, buy individual stocks.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:48):**  If you buy shares of Apple, then you know your money is in Apple or in Tesla.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:54):**  So at least is aware.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:13:56):**  Now the question of whether that investment is no harm depends in part on your own philosophy  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:04):**  or beliefs.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:05):**  So if you say, hey, I love Apple, they do beautiful phones and they produce this great  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:11):**  computers that I love, of course, is not hard.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:15):**  Or some people may say, well, look at the business model of Apple that requires you  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:20):**  to change your phone every year and create all this electronic waste and extract all  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:24):**  this rare materials from the earth or look at the working conditions in Foxconn, the  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:29):**  big manufacturing plant where most of the phones are made.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:34):**  And a few years ago, they were putting nets outside the windows because people were jumping  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:38):**  to their death.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:39):**  I mean, the condition was so bad.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:41):**  Right.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:42):**  So you could say, well, maybe Apple is not exactly a no harm company, but that is a decision  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:48):**  that you would make on your own.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:50):**  Now the next level is what I call positive investment.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:14:55):**  And I used to call it impact investment, but the term is used widely.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:01):**  And I believe not all impact investments are positive investments, meaning a lot of impact  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:07):**  investments.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:08):**  People are not really aware of what they do out there.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:11):**  You know, they might hear, oh, great, this is a solar installation project in Mexico.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:17):**  Must be good.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:18):**  Must be an impact investment.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:19):**  But if you look closely, you find out that they displaced indigenous populations or provide  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:25):**  no benefits to the local community.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:27):**  Right.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:28):**  They might still be extracted.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:29):**  And so I use the term positive investing to indicate an investment where you are aware,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:35):**  you know, it's doing no harm and it's actually trying to solve an environmental or social  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:40):**  problem.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:41):**  And maybe I'll give an example of that.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:43):**  And the last category is what I call restorative.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:47):**  And this is in between investing in philanthropy where you're using capital to really make  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:15:55):**  amends and fix the problems that capitalism created in the first place.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:00):**  And so it is aware it's no harm.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:02):**  You know, it's solving a social environmental problem, but the expected return is negative.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:07):**  I mean, you net of risk, you know, on a risk adjusted basis, you don't expect all your  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:11):**  capital to come back.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:13):**  And those things could be some local investing could be considered restorative investing.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:21):**  And one thing that I forgot to mention, the positive investments still have a positive  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:26):**  risk adjusted future.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:28):**  So you expect your capital back on average and some richer.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:32):**  So those are basically a classification I like to use the unaware, aware, no harm, positive  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:41):**  and restored.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:43):**  I have a course starting in May called Towards Aware, No Harm Investing.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:47):**  And one of the exercises is building a personal investment compass.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:52):**  The idea is that sit down and think about what you want to see out there in the world  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:16:58):**  and what are the things you would like to participate in improving?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:03):**  And more importantly, what are the things you don't want to participate in with your  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:06):**  investments?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:07):**  So, for example, if you care about global warming or, you know, prison industrial complex  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:12):**  or healthy food or immigrant populations, whatever you care about, you know, make sure  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:20):**  that your investments are not creating more of the problem you want to see solved.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:25):**  And so the personal investment compass acts then as a guide, both in terms of what type  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:31):**  of restorative investments or impact invest or positive investments you might make and  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:37):**  also what you will move away from.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:41):**  And so, you know, I make this example of the one of the companies in the S&P is a big weapons  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:52):**  manufacturer.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:53):**  And if you ask the name of that particular company, Ingo, I think it's called, let me  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:17:58):**  see, it's called Huntington Ingalls Industries.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:01):**  Right.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:02):**  If you ask people, hey, do you own Huntington Ingalls industry?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:06):**  You know, they're the biggest builder of military ships and nuclear submarine and guided missile  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:12):**  destroyers.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:13):**  People say, oh, I don't think so.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:16):**  I don't know.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:17):**  But if you own an S&P index fund, you do own that company and every missile is fired.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:23):**  You make some money and every you know.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:26):**  So that's that's the the problem with using mutual funds to invest.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:32):**  And of course, that's probably going to be what most people will do.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:36):**  And moving towards ESG and social response fund is a good first step.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:41):**  But I think if we really care about regeneration, if we really care about having a viable society  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:48):**  and a viable ecosystem, we need to move way beyond mutual funds.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:51):**  And we need to think about what are the best things we're doing out there in the world.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:18:57):**  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, but I'm struggling to think how most people listening to this,  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:01):**  many of whom might be completely new to investing like myself, can make any impact in this huge  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:07):**  system with more money than I can even wrap my head around.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:10):**  Well, there are first do not underestimate the actions of millions of people.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:18):**  Cultural shifts can happen and they can happen rapidly.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:21):**  I mean, if you think about one of the recent cultural shifts in this country is around,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:27):**  for example, the use of recreational drugs.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:29):**  I mean, if you're thinking about just 10 years ago, it would have been almost inconceivable,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:34):**  right?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:35):**  Inconceivable that a number of states would say it's OK to smoke pot.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:38):**  I mean, that is a major shift.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:40):**  And we had the shifts like that about the role of women in society.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:45):**  I think now there is a whole discussion about Black Lives Matter and minorities and so on.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:52):**  So cultural shifts can happen fast.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:19:55):**  And so I am trying to inject little ideas, little memes out there about the importance  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:01):**  paying attention to our investments.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:04):**  The first thing that people can do is you see a lot of the big changes in society.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:10):**  We need to wait for the government.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:11):**  We need to lobby government or large corporations.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:14):**  But when we're talking about your own investments, you can actually decide tomorrow not to be  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:19):**  participating in the suicide economy.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:22):**  Right.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:23):**  So while you might say, hey, my thousand dollars invested with an S&P in the index fund is  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:31):**  not really going to make a difference.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:33):**  The question is, do you want to participate in what may be a general ecocide?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:39):**  Right.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:40):**  I mean, do you want to participate with your money in the problems you want to try to solve?  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:44):**  And if the answer is no, then that little shift that you can make with your one hundred  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:50):**  dollars or a thousand dollars away from the extractive economy can be very meaningful  
**[0:20:55-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:20:55):**  to you personally, but in aggregate can eventually make us reach the tipping point where a culture  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:04):**  shift can be propagated much faster across the world.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:10):**  And I think there is now more and more attention paid to the role our investments are playing  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:17):**  out there.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:18):**  There is a demand for social responsible funds.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:20):**  Again, I don't think that goes far enough.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:23):**  People are mindful about their buying choices and how that is affecting the industry, for  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:29):**  example, the demand for organic or for locally grown food and so on.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:35):**  So I would say, of course, each individual action is not going to change the world, but  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:41):**  it's going to change your world and your relationship to it.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:45):**  And then when enough of us follow suit, we can actually transform society.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:49):**  OK, yeah, that makes me feel a bit more optimistic about being able to affect change in this  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:21:54):**  area, but I'm still a total novice to investing and wouldn't even know where to start.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:00):**  What advice would you give to a beginner like me with no previous experience on how to start  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:03):**  using small amounts of money to create change?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:06):**  I would say, you know, as a starting point, make a small investment in C note.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:11):**  And there is another company I like, which is RSF Social Finance Social Investment Fund  
**[0:22:15-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:15):**  in in San Francisco, and they basically fund social entrepreneurs and nonprofits operating  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:25):**  in the arts and all their schools and so on.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:28):**  So they they invest in really cool stuff.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:31):**  And the nice thing about both C note and our surface, it's open to everybody.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:36):**  The memory investment is pretty low.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:38):**  I think in the case of our service, a thousand dollars in the case of C note, there is no  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:44):**  minimum.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:45):**  The key is to then read the quarterly newsletter that they put out so that you feel good about  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:51):**  what your money is doing out there in the world.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:53):**  That would be a good starting point.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:55):**  Again, the other one would be, you know, take my course.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:22:58):**  People are inclined to learn about this new space of a way to no harm investing.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:03):**  So I'll present more more options and how to think about it and how to frame it.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:08):**  So tell me what I would be able to do with the knowledge and training in your course.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:12):**  Right.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:13):**  So the course is taught in mostly in May through five interactive sessions.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:21):**  And really, there are various steps.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:24):**  The first one, I guess in the first couple of sessions, I'm trying to connect the dots  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:28):**  and show people how the financial system is implicated in a lot of the problems we really  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:34):**  care about, including the destruction of the environment and the problems in society.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:39):**  The second part is really about showing people how really money is created, what the operations  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:46):**  of the bank and the Federal Reserve have done in manipulating financial markets so that  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:53):**  if people think that, oh, they can get our at least eight percent return from the stock  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:23:58):**  market going forward every year from now on, I think they might be sorely disappointed.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:04):**  And that's one part of the course is really challenging capital market expectation, challenging  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:10):**  what financial advisors are assuming we are going to get through traditional investments.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:17):**  And then we'll talk about developing a personal investment compass and we'll introduce the  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:21):**  concept of integrating financial and non-financial consideration.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:26):**  So yes, we have to look at risk, but we also have to look at the risk of not having a livable  
**[0:24:31-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:31):**  planet a few years from now, right, or an economy that is all dominated by two players  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:38):**  or Amazon.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:39):**  Right.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:40):**  And so integrating both risk and return considerations with non-financial considerations.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:47):**  And then we're going to look at examples of investments and how to determine the portion  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:53):**  of your portfolio that can be devoted to restorative investing.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:24:58):**  So I think that most of the value is in the interaction with people.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:01):**  We have a number of amazing people already sign up for the course and we're very looking  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:05):**  forward to that.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:08):**  And in terms of time commitment, I mean, there is every week is going to be an hour and a  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:12):**  half zoom and then there are some readings and some discussion, maybe another hour per  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:18):**  week or so.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:19):**  So maybe we're talking about three hours per week for the next five weeks of May.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:26):**  And I think people will be able to get a lot out of it.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:32):**  There you have it.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:33):**  Marco's insights really got me thinking about how money can be leveraged for positive change  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:37):**  once we divest from destructive industries and go beyond the vote with your purchase  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:43):**  narrative to invest in initiatives that can create new options for a healthier and brighter  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:48):**  future.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:49):**  Marco and I spoke a whole lot more than I was able to fit in this episode.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:52):**  He gave me a lot of specific investment opportunities that illustrate the restorative options and  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:57):**  concepts that we covered.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:25:59):**  And we even got into a long chat about the return on interest of restoring landscape  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:26:04):**  hydrology versus carbon sequestration.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:26:07):**  So if you've already subscribed to the Regenerative Skills Patreon, you'll have access to the  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/investing-in-regeneration-how-to-rethink-your-wealth/#t=0:26:10):**  full unedited conversation that I had with Marco.

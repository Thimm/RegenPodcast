**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:34):**  and the open Q&A for listeners after the panel.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:37):**  In today's session, I hosted a discussion on regenerative fashion with my friends and  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:42):**  colleagues at Climate Farmers, a non-profit organization working to advance regenerative  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:47):**  agriculture in Europe.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:49):**  Since these discussions are a little longer than the regular weekly episodes, I'll keep  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:53):**  the introductions short and jump right into the introductions for our two panelists.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:58):**  First up we have Rebecca Burgess, who is the executive director of Fibershed and chair  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:02):**  of the board of the Carbon Cycle Institute and author of both the books Fibershed and  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:07):**  Harvesting Color.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:09):**  She's a vocationally trained weaver and natural dyer.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:12):**  And Burgess has built an extensive network of farmers and artisans in the Northern California  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:17):**  Fibershed to pilot an innovative fiber system model at the community scale.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:23):**  Our second panelist today is Aroha Alvarez Fernandez, sustainability entrepreneur who  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:28):**  is one of the founders at Trace Collective and Trace Planet, an activist fashion brand  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:33):**  and community organization on a mission to make the fashion industry a driver of environmental  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:38):**  regeneration and to help communities reconnect with the products they buy.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:43):**  Really quick here before we get to the panel, we had some technical difficulties while recording  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:47):**  and lost a couple of the first few minutes of the call, so we jump right into Rebecca's  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:52):**  answer a little bit abruptly.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:54):**  But the question that I asked in the lead up to this is, what does a global regenerative  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:58):**  fashion industry look like in terms of fiber and material production?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:02):**  And she started by stressing the need to take care of this at a local level in order to  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:06):**  better inform the global scale.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:10):**  Understanding frameworks from on high could work, but really the detailed responses to  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:15):**  ecological restoration and health are going to be at the community scale.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:21):**  We need to be able to take measurements and create modeling systems based on responses  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:26):**  to our actions at the local level.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:30):**  So I see the way that the global textile community starts to see benefit and positive feedback  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:38):**  loops, which would be lowering emissions in the atmosphere, restoring aquifers, enhancing  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:44):**  biodiversity metrics.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:46):**  For those feedback loops to take place, we fundamentally need every community to figure  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:53):**  out how to handle aquifer restoration, how to handle soil carbon sequestration in their  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:00):**  home communities.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:02):**  So I guess I would say the answers are decentralization.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:06):**  The answers are investing in communities to create these responses at the local level  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:12):**  and functionally to decentralize manufacturing because through the laws of thermodynamics,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:18):**  there's just no way we can keep up this idea of moving non-perishable goods, which we can  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:24):**  do because currently they're non-perishable, not like the food supply.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:29):**  We're moving them huge distances to manufacture them, but we've been doing that because we've  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:33):**  externalized the costs of carbon.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:36):**  So we really do need to consider the decentralization movement, which will give brands kind of a  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:43):**  bespoke selection of manufacturing centers across the world that will reflect the terroir  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:49):**  of those regions.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:50):**  So I think it's going to be a beautiful future if we just kind of open ourselves up to the  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:56):**  idea, the paradigm shift of what it means to decentralize some of these systems.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:01):**  I'll leave it there.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:03):**  That's a great start.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:05):**  How about you, Aurora?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:06):**  Tell us what you envision as a regenerative fashion future.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:10):**  Yeah, so I think it's, hi Rebecca, it's nice to see you again.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:15):**  I think it's, so to me, when it comes to regenerative fashion, I think there are three principles  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:24):**  that always we need to take into account.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:27):**  One is that it actually produced positive environmental outputs, so positive environmental  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:33):**  impacts, and that's where we really need to go into textile fibers that are at the moment  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:38):**  the only ones that offer as these, and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:42):**  And then there are other two layers that really relate to what Rebecca has said that is minimizing  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:47):**  externalities.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:48):**  At the moment, the industry has so many, such massive environmental externalities, and there  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:56):**  are many ways to reduce them, but one key one is through localization, and through really  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:02):**  opening up to the beauty of how do more local supply chains look like in the fashion industry.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:08):**  So really minimizing externalities.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:10):**  And then the third one, using fashion as a healing tool for society, which until now  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:17):**  it hasn't been really.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:20):**  So there is a lot of negative social impacts of the fashion industry that don't rely only  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:24):**  on worker exploitation, but that relate to cultural appropriation and a lack of diversity  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:31):**  and many issues.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:32):**  And I think when we talk about regenerative fashion, for sure while the core is connecting  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:37):**  it to regenerative agriculture, we also need to think about what role can such a big industry,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:43):**  which is producing a good that is not necessary in terms of we have enough clothes in the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:48):**  world to go around forever, we don't need more clothes.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:52):**  What role does it have to play in also healing us and bringing us back together as a society?  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:56):**  Fantastic observations there.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:58):**  It sounds to me that the evolution of the fashion industry in order to become more regenerative  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:03):**  is similar to many other industries that we have, which currently bring a lot of problems  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:08):**  in pollution, especially the food system and how this all relates in with farming, like  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:13):**  many of us are focused on now.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:15):**  And from there, I'd like to ask what clothing production methods from the past and from  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:21):**  indigenous cultures can inform the global clothing industry, as well as what new technologies  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:27):**  offer hope for responsible textile farming and manufacturing, because it seems like the  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:31):**  two need to go hand in hand for us to be able to move forward and address the modern problems  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:37):**  that we are seeing in this industry at large, perhaps starting with Aroha.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:41):**  Oh, I think Rebecca will have much more to say about this because of her background expertise.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:47):**  But so I think so there is like some new technologies that definitely are relevant here, especially  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:55):**  when it comes to helping us really measure, you know, and leverage the latest science  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:02):**  when it comes to regenerative agriculture and, you know, giving farmers the guidelines  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:08):**  and, you know, and the visibility that they need because of the measurement tools that  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:13):**  we have.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:14):**  So new technologies have a role to play, but I think effectively, like you say, we need  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:19):**  to look into the past.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:21):**  And I think especially in the fashion, not especially in the fashion industry, in so  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:25):**  many industries, but in fashion, there is this huge conversations about innovation in  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:30):**  the in quite bizarre ways often.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:33):**  And it feels like we are looking to technology to save us from some problems that technology  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:38):**  has created.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:40):**  And what we need is to change our mindset and really understand that no technology is  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:44):**  going to save us from unchecked consumption and from complete disconnection from our supply  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:50):**  chains.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:51):**  So it's effectively about looking at what are the ways that we produce throughout like  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:57):**  all of our history that kept a balance with nature and recovering those practices and  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:05):**  those technologies and understanding that, you know, some things shouldn't be scaled  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:11):**  and productivity shouldn't be maximized, you know, areas on that products have a price  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:15):**  that is that is higher and that we need to pay for.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:18):**  I love that response.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:20):**  Thank you.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:22):**  And I would just second all of that.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:24):**  And that idea that some things don't need to be maximized.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:28):**  I was just reflecting as you were speaking about a post I saw, like a decolonizing post  
**[0:09:35-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:35):**  was a quote from a British military official who was defining nation states in Africa,  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:44):**  places that he'd never been.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:45):**  He was creating new political boundaries to define those countries, you know, politic,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:52):**  tax base, etc.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:54):**  And in the quote, it was like there are mountains I've never seen.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:57):**  There are rivers I've never crossed, but I have the ability to define the future of this  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:02):**  landscape.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:04):**  And here where I am in the western part of the United States, you know, I work with tribal  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:13):**  leaders who say, you know, you should read what the pope originally said when they sent  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:19):**  the explorers from Spain to to the to what is now North American continent and South  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:25):**  American continent.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:27):**  Anything they could see was the land of it became incorporated into the land of the Spanish,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:34):**  you know, into their into their government.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:37):**  So it wasn't about knowing landscapes.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:39):**  It wasn't about understanding ecosystems.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:41):**  It was just the colonizer mind is just about appropriating what you can see or you can  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:47):**  put on a paper.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:49):**  But how do we solve ecosystem collapse with that mindset of not really being intimate  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:56):**  with anything?  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:57):**  And I think we have to really that that colonized mindset is still in things like, frankly,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:05):**  the Hague Index.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:06):**  It's still in things that tell us what sustainability is, because it's measuring things from way  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:13):**  far away and appropriating and extrapolating little bits of measurement across broad landscapes.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:20):**  It reminds me so much of the map makers from the last colonized era.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:24):**  This idea that you can extrapolate measurement in one thing and say everyone's doing this  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:30):**  when a cotton fields can have literally different water usage and pesticide and insecticide  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:36):**  usage from one corner to the other.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:38):**  There's so much variability in these systems and heterogeneity that I I think that the  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:43):**  indigenous heart of our planet, we all have that.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:48):**  We all have an indigenous place.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:49):**  We all have a place where we came from that we were connected to.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:54):**  And some of us still have that.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:56):**  But those of us who are transplants who are looking at what was the ecosystem's way of  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:03):**  being or the way of being with ecosystems that worked like here in California, it's  
**[0:12:07-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:07):**  13000 years of management of redbud and sedge and all of these plants that were used for  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:16):**  watertight baskets and some of the dress forms.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:22):**  And those plant species like here's just one example.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:25):**  There's an area north of us that you know about the California fires, right?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:30):**  And so you've seen these neighborhoods completely flattened in ash.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:36):**  Those areas in Santa Rosa, Sonoma County are areas that were historically covered like  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:42):**  a square mile where those coffee home burns keep happening.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:48):**  They are actually in this downward slope of a huge fire corridor.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:53):**  And that's been known for 13000 years.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:56):**  And that fire corridor used to hold dogbane, massive amounts of the fiber crop that supported  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:01):**  fish weir development, textile development, string rope.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:06):**  It's our native hemp in California.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:09):**  And there was literally the Native Americans say, well, if you want to call what we were  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:13):**  doing industrial, we were doing industrial production of this crop, but we were allowing  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:18):**  it to reseed and rhizomatously spread.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:22):**  And we planted it in the fire corridor because it regenerates in those fire ecologies.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:30):**  So that fiber system was literally consciously put in the wave of fire.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:37):**  Now for us, the colonizer mind comes in and says, let's put homes there and take up the  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:42):**  fiber system that was indigenous.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:45):**  And so it's just one example of kind of the, well, if you don't pay attention to landscapes,  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:51):**  you pay the price.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:53):**  And I think that at this point we have, as you're saying, like this need to connect,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:58):**  but the connection isn't just because it's a nice thing to do.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:02):**  I think our survival depends on it.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:04):**  So yeah, just leave it there.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:07):**  Well, that goes in depth to what you were talking about for your vision of a regenerative  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:13):**  fashion world of this decentralization that is correctly adapted to its place in its resources,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:20):**  as well as the biological and cultural history of a place that kind of all work in harmony  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:27):**  when done at a correct scale or even we'll not call correct, bad, good.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:32):**  I don't like those labels, but something that is appropriate to the unique conditions and  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:37):**  the context of where you find it.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:39):**  Auroa, do you have reference to those types of things and this balance between, I guess,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:45):**  production methods, but also this idea of rooting the sources of your materials and  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:53):**  the way that they're used from the way that people have interacted with them in those  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:56):**  places historically?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:58):**  Yeah, we do.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:01):**  But I must say it's really difficult for us as a brand, you know, like not wearing the  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:08):**  brand hat.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:09):**  So at the moment, so at Trace Collective, we only source linen from Western Europe and  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:17):**  hemp from Eastern Europe, which are crops that have been grown there for like millennia  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:23):**  by local population.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:25):**  And linen in Europe has always been, but that's why the word linen comes from like, like,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:33):**  linen and, you know, linen was the fabric that we had at home and that we did at home  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:37):**  and that we had knowledge of how to do it.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:40):**  If you wanted clothes, you had to grow linen in your house in the past in many areas.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:46):**  So we do have kind of like talk to farmers and make sure that there was this consistency  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:53):**  across, you know, like history and the practices being used.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:57):**  But what we find really as a barrier is that we haven't been able to find local systems  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:09):**  that, you know, take, you know, grow the fabric and connect to the meals and give us the end  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:15):**  outputs that we need in the quantities that we need as a fashion brand.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:20):**  So we also work with like other meals and check with them kind of like farmer integrity  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:26):**  and like how farmers are growing and to make sure that we are avoiding like industrial  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:30):**  farming.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:31):**  But so it's quite challenging.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:33):**  I guess what is quite interesting and came to my mind as Rebecca was speaking is that  
**[0:16:39-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:39):**  this very local quality of sustainability that we tend to forget.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:47):**  And I think that is a trap that we really fall into in the fashion industry and us,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:51):**  you know, in on in the lack of a better system where, you know, we have these big certifications  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:58):**  that at the moment are the the only the only tool that most brands have to understand what  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:04):**  is it that they are buying.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:06):**  But obviously, those certifications leave out so much of the local context of, you know,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:12):**  like what each region and each bioregion needs and like what is sustainable there and what  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:17):**  should be grown there.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:18):**  You know, it's not only about growing organic cotton, but like where are you growing it?  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:25):**  And yeah, I think that's like a really interesting challenge that where I mean, effectively,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:31):**  you see that you need to build those close relationships with farmers and get that visibility  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:37):**  and like really connect to those to those origin stories.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:43):**  If you want to go deep into what is sustainable and what is regenerative and to understand  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:47):**  the impact of your of your of your production.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:51):**  And I must say for us, we are like only halfway there right now.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:54):**  It's really complex.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:55):**  I'm really glad how you touched on it there.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:57):**  It's like fashion is a very large and multifaceted industry.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:02):**  And so far, I've kind of been talking about it as if it were one thing.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:05):**  But there are so many steps along that line from the farmers to the distributors and all  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:11):**  of the processes of manufacturing before it actually makes it to retail and the consumers  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:15):**  themselves.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:16):**  And so let's start back at the beginning a little bit and talk about how, like many other  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:21):**  commodity farm products, we're often told that the only fiber production business models  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:27):**  that are viable are these large scale operations, much like commodity farming of food as well.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:33):**  Do you have any examples of small scale fiber producers that are respectively profitable?  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:40):**  I know both of you kind of work at that smaller scale, maybe starting with Rebecca.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:44):**  Well, you know, it's interesting.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:45):**  It depends on the fiber.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:48):**  And I was actually just having this reflection with someone who works at a large uptake brand,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:54):**  global global brand yesterday.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:58):**  And I was reflecting on cotton systems because, you know, in the United States, a lot of folks  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:04):**  are like, well, why, why are all the farms so big for cotton?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:09):**  And you know, one of the key, if not in the top three reasons for why the scale is what  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:15):**  it is, is because that the cotton farmers in the US are competing with cotton farmers  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:21):**  in countries that have very different relationships to hierarchy and labor.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:28):**  And the United States, I mean, we have gone through so much in cotton systems and it shows  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:35):**  up in this oppression of a whole community of people.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:40):**  And it's still unfurling like that, that use of slave labor, the effects of that we are  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:46):**  living today.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:48):**  And so cotton, to me, the fact that it's gone to the scale it has is because those growers  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:55):**  need to use mechanized equipment.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:58):**  There's very few small scale growers who can remain effective because of the labor situation  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:04):**  and that we're competing with countries whose moral arc of justice hasn't been fully expressed  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:10):**  yet.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:11):**  And we're still in our journey of that expression of justice coming home to roost.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:16):**  It keeps its layer and layer and layer.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:19):**  We keep having an expression of justice and a retraction and an expression and a retraction.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:25):**  And that shows up in the agricultural systems.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:28):**  And so I think part of the reason we're so large in the US with our cotton production  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:31):**  is due to the fact that we're competing with countries that have been suppressing communities  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:37):**  still in many cases and that handpicking cotton is still something that's very much done in  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:43):**  other parts of the world.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:46):**  Sometimes it's done in a just system, but in many cases it's done in an injustice system.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:50):**  So I have a different relationship with cotton and scale because of the history in the United  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:55):**  States of slavery.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:57):**  I also would say, though, that a small scale, most of the fiber producers that are profitable  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:04):**  are using like sheep, for instance, as part of an organic crop food crop rotation where  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:10):**  they're using sheep in their vineyard systems.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:12):**  There's very profitable wine and food production systems that can layer fiber producing animals.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:19):**  Those are profitable.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:20):**  You don't need a lot of animals to do that.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:23):**  It's more of like an expansive market garden who might mow down their cover crop with a  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:27):**  handful of sheep who are then sheared and maybe some of that yarn makes it out to the  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:33):**  farmer's market.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:34):**  But the engine of the economy for a small scale grower, at least in our region, remains  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:40):**  the food system.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:41):**  And it's the specialty crops that continue to be the bread and butter of the agricultural  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:46):**  community and the animals are part of an ecological function tool.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:51):**  So I guess I don't have as much, it's hard for me to say like, oh, cotton should just  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:55):**  be small scale and handpicked because our country has been there and it's not pretty.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:00):**  So I just, I don't have the same, like scale to me is all about how is justice being served  
**[0:22:06-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:06):**  for land and people and maybe our questions around scale start getting more nuanced.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:14):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:16):**  Very good example there.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:19):**  On our side, so we do know of like farmers that are profitable and making it work small  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:26):**  scale with flax in Europe.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:30):**  So I know examples in Western Spain, sorry, I always get my East and West countries, Western  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:37):**  Spain and also in the North of France.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:41):**  But like it's really challenging and it's something that they emphasize all the time.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:48):**  It's just really challenging.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:49):**  And it's because I think also when it comes to our governments, our governments and you  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:54):**  know, government incentives are not incentivizing market farmers to stay small.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:01):**  So very often in many European countries incentives are given according, you know, like according  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:08):**  to the amount of land that you have, which could make sense in a way.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:12):**  But then what that means is that farmers who have very small farms actually qualify for  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:19):**  almost no support and they are always under pressure to sell their lands to others who  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:24):**  are like expanding.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:26):**  So like it's definitely like we know of examples that are working and our concern right now  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:32):**  is like how do we protect those and how do we replicate those because there's a very  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:37):**  clear tendency because of markets and governments to disappear.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:42):**  And it's just and I think there's also, sorry, just one last thought.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:46):**  At least in the cases that I know, there's also a part of losing cultural heritage with  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:55):**  a generational change.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:56):**  So it's, you know, it's really common that just newer generations don't want to work  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:02):**  in the farms and we are losing that knowledge that, for example, when I think of Western  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:08):**  Spain and linen production there, it's very like an artisan knowledge where they go through  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:13):**  all these steps of like flax transformation into linen and that is lost because, yeah,  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:20):**  because no young people want to take on that trade because it's not where you can make  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:26):**  most money.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:28):**  You had mentioned smaller scale flax operations being profitable.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:31):**  Can you give me an idea of the scale that you're referring to?  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:35):**  No, not really.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:37):**  In terms of land size.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:43):**  I don't know on the top of my head, but I could tell you afterwards.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:47):**  I know from talking to them and no, no.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:50):**  I'm just thinking it's probably going to be of interest to the farmers who are on this  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:54):**  call.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:55):**  It's something I can follow up on afterwards.  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:58):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:59):**  And Rebecca, do you have similar examples?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:03):**  Because you had mentioned about smaller scale operations being profitable with leather and  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:08):**  especially animal products.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:10):**  Are you also utilized or have you seen the utilization of waste products into novel or  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:16):**  new forms of fibers?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:17):**  For example, unfortunately, the panelists who wasn't able to be here, Umaima has been  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:22):**  pioneering pineapple and banana fibers as waste products from the industries in Bangladesh.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:29):**  Have you seen potential in these types of products in your area?  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:36):**  We're getting there.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:37):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:38):**  I think the technology company that we are excited about who's circling around California  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:46):**  and other parts of the world who has a bio refinery model, it's Agri loop.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:51):**  I'm sure there's other companies too that are looking at this model where they are.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:56):**  So you can use banana, pineapple, and those are not crops that work in our location because  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:03):**  we're a more temperate climate.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:04):**  But yes, the flax tow.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:07):**  So the shorter staple flax, we're looking at how that can be turned into maybe even  
**[0:26:14-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:14):**  a filament, but possibly just a well spun yarn.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:22):**  It's a very tricky process because you need things not to pill, not to break.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:26):**  And so these shorter fibers that you see in so many food crops, it's a real science to  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:32):**  get that to be a durable textile.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:35):**  So the systems we're looking at are if cannabis focused hemp growing, it creates very bushy  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:42):**  crops, but that's primarily where the American hemp industry so far has gone.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:46):**  Of course, we've overproduced, can have been producing, we have flooded these markets,  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:51):**  but those who end up retaining in the hemp market, there's definitely ways that we could  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:57):**  use those, even those bifurcated stems and through certain systems, those shorter staple  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:03):**  fibers from hemp or flax could be used into yarn development.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:07):**  It will take more technology because we don't have a lot of fiber focused hemp growers.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:14):**  I can't even, I mean, maybe there's some on the panel that I haven't seen, but the economics  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:19):**  work in the US for people just to grow hemp for fiber.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:24):**  We're still trying to figure out all the different ways.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:28):**  You need value added systems because in so many ways for hemp to work, for instance,  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:33):**  it's not just the textile manufacturing systems you need.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:36):**  You need to understand how to create the herd economy and is the herd going into animal  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:41):**  bedding?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:42):**  Is it going into hemp creep or building?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:44):**  And all of those systems, all the value addition systems have to be invested in at once for  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:50):**  the farmer to be able to make use of all the products that come off that crop.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:54):**  It's a dynamic crop.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:56):**  But yeah, I think it's just a matter of time before we see more agricultural material that  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:02):**  wouldn't traditionally be used for a textile being used.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:06):**  It's just an investment issue more so than anything else.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:12):**  The infrastructure has to be easy for the producers to access because if there pretty  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:17):**  much any point of friction or difficulty in the process is going to marginalize it as  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:23):**  a waste product the way it has been up until now, I would imagine.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:27):**  Yes.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:28):**  Yes.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:29):**  And I hope that when we have these kind of investment conversations about building up  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:35):**  our manufacturing sector in our country that people will take textile into consideration  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:40):**  because it's just it's a wonderful part of the sector of the economy that we could be  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:46):**  breathing more life into.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:48):**  Okay.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:49):**  Well, it seems to me that the difficulty here is making the argument or making the case  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:56):**  that this can compete with the synthetic fibers and especially dyes and other processes like  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:03):**  nylon and acrylic and others that have flooded the market and become the cheap alternative  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:08):**  that is really fueling fast fashion and these other symptoms of the industry at large that  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:14):**  are difficult to compete with in this decentralized and bespoke industry that we're somewhat advocating  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:20):**  for here.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:21):**  Can you make the case for not only why this is important on a ecological, I guess, aspect  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:30):**  or perspective, but what are the other benefits that can help to bring meaning behind the  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:36):**  higher costs of a better way of producing all types of fibers and clothing?  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:43):**  Starting with Aroha.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:46):**  Right now, we need to completely change how our textile pie looks like.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:53):**  You know, at the moment, I think like latest data from textile exchange is that 63 percent  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:00):**  of global textile production is synthetics, which is insane.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:04):**  No, it's like we are using non-renewable resources to produce fabrics that are going  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:11):**  to stay there forever, kind of damage all across the supply chain.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:17):**  And so, I mean, are there other arguments besides the environmental one?  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:24):**  I think the environmental one is the most important one, but I think there is a lot  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:29):**  to speak about, you know, just building this connection with the story behind the product  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:34):**  that you buy, you know, and I think just put it in a very blunt way.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:38):**  I personally don't want to wear plastic, you know, it's like, I mean, and it's like quite  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:44):**  basic.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:45):**  And we're getting used to it, but just wearing a polyester t-shirt as opposed to wearing  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:50):**  a cotton t-shirt or like a wool jumper, it's a completely different way on how it interacts  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:57):**  with your skin, you know, just the connection that you create with it.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:03):**  So I think there's also like this human, you know, not only on the touch, but also this  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:10):**  human storyline of, well, you're buying a product, this product has a story.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:14):**  You can be buying something that is like completely man-made, completely opaque, completely polluting,  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:19):**  or you can be buying something that you can trace back, hopefully, you know, like if we  
**[0:31:23-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:23):**  get to a degree of transparency in the fashion industry, that you can trace back to a farmer,  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:31):**  you know, and to the land that is around you and that when you don't need it anymore, we  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:38):**  will go back into that land.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:40):**  So obviously I think the environmental argument is the most important one, but there's also  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:45):**  this really important part of reconnecting with the products that we buy and understanding  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:51):**  how in a way we, you know, like we are, we're only a small part of the supply chain, right?  
**[0:31:58-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:58):**  There's so much that happens before us and so much that happens after and our decision  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:04):**  of what kind of product do we purchase creates that story.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:09):**  So just to reflect, I love everything that you've said, and just to reflect on the question  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:14):**  about affordability or how do we compete?  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:16):**  I mean, is that okay?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:18):**  Well, I've been thinking a lot about the transformation of this industry into something that includes  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:25):**  service and experience, and instead of just pumping out goods, which has already been  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:31):**  mentioned, like we're flooded, we're over consuming, we have surpluses that we aren't  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:39):**  even there's inventory surpluses, there's consumer goods that are at surplus that are  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:45):**  already on the rack that get burned there or incinerated because they don't get sold  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:51):**  too much.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:52):**  There's already too much.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:53):**  So I'm wondering about the industry, if looking at a model of service whereby you take a higher  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:00):**  priced good and you, you know, and there are businesses doing this, but you start bringing  
**[0:33:06-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:06):**  in a culture of repair, not just again, of company coming in and using the idea of circularity  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:15):**  as another form of centralizing wealth and power, but to think about decentralizing the  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:21):**  process of making sure clothing circulates in a community.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:25):**  Like we always say like local dollars, you want a dollar to circulate as much as possible.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:29):**  The most beautiful, prosperous communities are where currency circulates over and over  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:35):**  and over again in that community and does not get extracted out.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:39):**  Clothing is a similar, it's a currency.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:41):**  How can you keep it circulating in the community for as long as possible?  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:46):**  What are the beautiful strategies that we've been missing because we've moved so quickly  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:51):**  into the idea of disposability, but what are the beautiful ways of keeping the clothing  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:57):**  in play through trading that clothing together freely, taking the commodification out, but  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:03):**  could some of these smaller brands who have a focus on their community or even large brands,  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:09):**  I don't know what their strategy would be, but the idea of hosting the clothing swap,  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:13):**  hosting, we hosted a mending bar at a design school in San Francisco.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:17):**  People came and drank some beer and sewed their buttons and changed their hemlines.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:23):**  We rolled sewing machines in and needles and threads so that the culture of repair became  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:29):**  a true culture.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:31):**  And so the service there was creating the bar and getting the machines and the tools,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:38):**  but the experience was people sitting around and talking to each other and having a good  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:42):**  time connecting socially while keeping their clothes in play.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:46):**  And then people started trading their clothing.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:49):**  People started putting on each other's pieces.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:52):**  We put a photo shoot together and we brought a photographer that we work with.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:56):**  So she took photos of everyone's pieces and they got a photo of their mended piece.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:02):**  So we can slow fast fashion down.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:05):**  And I don't think all the business models should be nor should we be incentivizing the  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:10):**  big companies just to put boxes in their stores.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:14):**  Here come back and get a discount on your next thing.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:17):**  Like we shouldn't use circularity as an excuse to grow this system.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:21):**  We need systems that slow the whole thing down and change the consumption model so that  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:27):**  maybe a higher priced good that's a hundred percent natural fiber has a way longer arc  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:33):**  of time.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:34):**  So if you amortize the cost of it, it actually is saving you money.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:39):**  My great grandmother said, I'm too poor to buy cheap.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:43):**  Like I can't afford cheap.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:45):**  It's crazy.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:46):**  What are you doing?  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:47):**  It's going to fall apart.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:49):**  So if we have this, that adage, if we take that forward and we say, well, people don't  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:55):**  have enough money upfront.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:56):**  So can you like slowly make a payment on that thing?  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:00):**  That's a little higher price.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:01):**  That's already in existence.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:02):**  Some of the brands I know and love allow you to pay $15 a month.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:06):**  And after, you know, four months you own it.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:09):**  That's another way we could help.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:10):**  But I think we have to create services, experiences, decentralize the idea of circularity, and  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:17):**  maybe some of these brands will also find somewhat of a profit model in some of that.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:23):**  I don't, I'm not all for finding ways to profiteer off a de-growth model, but you know, we all,  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:30):**  there might be strategies that are still in service to the social repair work and the  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:35):**  fabric repair work that we all have at hand.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:40):**  I love the story of that event and I've been to similar ones myself.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:44):**  I wish that there was a bit more of a culture, especially on the masculine side of things  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:48):**  in interacting with clothing and repair and stuff.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:52):**  And I know that there is another cultures and it's something that I look forward to  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:55):**  reconnecting with.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:56):**  I'm fortunate that both my partner and her mother know how to sew and are often mending  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:00):**  things that I destroy.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:04):**  But it seems like re reinvigorating the interaction and the process of the things that we own  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:10):**  can more than justify the higher price.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:14):**  Like you were mentioning, when you look at it as something that is an investment as much  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:18):**  as you would perhaps, you know, investing in a house or a piece of land, something that's  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:22):**  going to be a major presence in a longer portion of your life, rather than something that you  
**[0:37:27-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:27):**  kind of go through your whims and through your wants and is transitory in that process  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:35):**  as well.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:37):**  Which makes me wonder, because of all of the positive aspects of reconnecting with these  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:42):**  things and I know for myself too, I value things more when I spend more money on them.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:46):**  And I've certainly heard that adage of not being wealthy enough to buy cheap things certainly  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:50):**  applies for tools as well since my background is more in construction.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:54):**  But it definitely applies to tools.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:57):**  It really does, it has very broad appeal and broad application.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:02):**  And this makes me wonder, like, what are some of the biggest roadblocks?  
**[0:38:07-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:07):**  What are some of the biggest hurdles for the expansion of regenerative textiles and fashion?  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:15):**  Where are you feeling the most pushback?  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:16):**  You can go, go ahead, Rekha.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:19):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:21):**  If you want to think more about it, I can jump in.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:26):**  No, no, I'm happy.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:29):**  I mean, basically, I think there are two sides, right?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:34):**  One is like market, so one side that is market incentives.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:39):**  And we have there like consumer demands, but also like other, you know, like set of incentives  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:48):**  around policy and, you know.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:51):**  And so when it comes to consumers, definitely we are talking about price points.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:57):**  But like, again, it's what Rebecca was saying and you were saying, you know, it's we just  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:01):**  need to step away from this culture that has been fed into us of like, we need to have  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:06):**  so many different things, you know, and go back to actually having a few things that  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:10):**  we really treasure and that we want to keep for life.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:14):**  But it's very difficult for consumers alone to make that mindset switch, you know, like  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:23):**  taking into account all of market dynamics.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:25):**  And I think, you know, effectively the problem today with fashion is that it's much more  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:31):**  profitable for a brand to not be regenerative and to be very damaging, but to actually take  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:38):**  responsibility for their supply chain and take responsibility for the products that  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:42):**  they put out on the world, because that's also a really important component for all  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:47):**  companies in the world, not only talking about, you know, fashion, but like companies are  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:52):**  not taking responsibility for what they put out, you know, like responsibilities eventually,  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:57):**  you know, passed on to the consumer and then to the government, you know, and this happens  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:01):**  in fashion, but it happens also when you buy a bottle of Coke, you know, like, you know,  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:06):**  the ways that is produced throughout the process is not something that companies are taking  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:10):**  responsibility for.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:12):**  And that's because like, they don't have to basically, you know, like we can get away  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:18):**  with not doing that.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:21):**  So I think a really important enabler is, you know, governments stepping up to level  
**[0:40:31-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:31):**  the playing field.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:32):**  And this is something that in the UK has been discussed for a while.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:37):**  And for example, last year, I don't know, my time is quite fluffy since the pandemic  
**[0:40:42-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:42):**  happened.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:43):**  Maybe this was two years ago, but there was a vote in parliament to put that tax on fast  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:49):**  fashion.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:50):**  And it was for me, an historic moment, you know, like to say like, this makes so much  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:55):**  sense because, you know, these companies are damaging the planet and we're all going to  
**[0:41:00-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:00):**  have to pay for it.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:01):**  But unfortunately, it wasn't voted.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:03):**  It didn't pass.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:05):**  Which, so I think, you know, one of the key barriers is the inability to compete evenly.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:14):**  And I think for that to happen, there needs to be government intervention, but for government  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:20):**  intervention to happen, there needs to be enough citizen support, you know, so there  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:23):**  is like a lot that needs to happen around like raising awareness and consumers speaking  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:28):**  up and voting with their purchase, but also voting, you know, like writing to their MP  
**[0:41:33-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:33):**  and like writing to fashion brands and showing that there is this movement and distraction.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:40):**  And I also, I think there is like another part that I'm sure like Rebecca and I mean,  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:44):**  you guys are climate farmers can really talk about, but it's making sure that there are,  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:50):**  there is enough support for, you know, like when it comes to farmers to be able to make  
**[0:41:57-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:57):**  this transition towards more regenerative practices.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:04):**  And when in terms of know-how, financial support, measurement, visibility, but also that there  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:11):**  is enough demand from fashion brands to really like make sure that if financially they saw.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:18):**  Love everything that you said.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:20):**  And I do feel like we're going to need the role of our citizen, our role as citizens  
**[0:42:27-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:27):**  has to take a very, we need to ramp up because as policies are shaped to incentivize regenerative  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:35):**  agriculture or smaller scale agriculture, the impediment to the regulatory frameworks  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:41):**  that we need and the incentives frameworks that we need has been the role, at least in  
**[0:42:45-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:45):**  ag in the United States of Monsanto now owned by Bayer or Syngenta or DuPont or Dow, like  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:56):**  those companies have been shaping farm policy in the United States for quite some time.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:02):**  So as fashion becomes a target for regulation, we have the same issues to be concerned about  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:07):**  who is going to be at the table shaping that policy.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:11):**  Our governor recently appointed, I found out a circular economy round table and appointed  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:19):**  the largest textile companies to the table.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:23):**  The NGOs weren't asked to participate.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:26):**  So I have to have a little conversation with our state government about what's going on  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:30):**  with that.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:32):**  So I do think we are all, you know, there's this huge push to say fashion needs to be  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:37):**  regulated, but we have to be extremely careful that we are ready as a society to step up  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:43):**  and make those public comments to get into those halls of power because those policies  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:49):**  could very easily start greasing the wheels for exactly what we don't want because that's  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:54):**  what's happened in agriculture and fashion could just be another pitfall if we don't  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:59):**  step up.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:01):**  So I think, yeah, we need to level the playing field and regulation has a position in that,  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:06):**  but regulation has to be, again, carefully watchdogged by many for this to come out in  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:12):**  the way that we don't just have ecological collapse and biodiversity collapse and human,  
**[0:44:17-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:17):**  you know, by humans, which is really exactly where we're headed at the moment.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:21):**  So there's work to turn this around, but we can't have the fox guarding the chicken  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:26):**  coop in the leveling of the playing field process.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:30):**  The other thing about regenerative ag, because farm policy has been shaped so long by conglomerates  
**[0:44:37-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:37):**  who make money off of patents and proprietary chemistry, we have a real problem with thoughtful  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:45):**  technical assistance providers, meaning who's on the landscape helping the agrarian community  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:51):**  make the transitions in, let's say, production agriculture.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:55):**  In the US, unlike the rest of other parts of the world, the US still, the large farms  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:01):**  technically are the suppliers of our fiber and food in many cases.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:06):**  We do have some pockets of decentralized food and fiber production, but production ag is  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:11):**  still predominantly what's here.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:16):**  And I just, I have a problem when I walk into production ag systems and I even have money  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:24):**  in my pocket from whatever a grant or support to have that farmer make a transition to multi-species  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:31):**  cover cropping or compost applications versus synthetic nitrogen use, or let's wean off  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:38):**  these chemicals and move here to these other practices, or let's focus on soil biology.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:45):**  There's knowledge gaps.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:47):**  It doesn't mean people aren't trying and there aren't people trying to bridge these deltas,  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:52):**  but there are functionally knowledge gaps in the system.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:55):**  And that is because our land grant universities in the US have also been predominantly bought.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:01):**  In many cases, the departments are very influenced by private dollars coming from the same companies  
**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:06):**  that are shaping policy.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:07):**  We know all this, but I think it really shows up when you're trying to make change and you  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:14):**  don't have the right technical assistance, money might even start rolling in, like governments  
**[0:46:20-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:20):**  are making shifts, right?  
**[0:46:22-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:22):**  Governments are starting to do little things, at least at the state and the county level  
**[0:46:25-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:25):**  where we are to incentivize a different form of agriculture, but then who's bridging your  
**[0:46:31-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:31):**  knowledge gaps?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:32):**  Because there's like a literally, as you were saying, like it takes one generation to lose  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:37):**  a textile recipe.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:39):**  It can take one generation to lose an understanding of how to do organic agriculture without tilling  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:45):**  the soil to pieces.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:48):**  You know, we have this move to no-till, but I saw some recent status of like Vermont no-till,  
**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:54):**  like they're seeing so much more herbicide runoff in their streams because no-till is  
**[0:46:58-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:58):**  coming with herbicide use in mass.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:02):**  That's not the solution to trying to reduce soil disturbance and build soil carbon.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:08):**  It's not that we then come with herbicides in large quantities to solve for our soil  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:14):**  disturbance issues.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:15):**  So again, we just see knowledge gaps.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:18):**  So I really, really hope, again, just to summarize, we step up as citizens and make sure we're  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:25):**  shaping the regulation and incentives policies and making public comments when those opportunities  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:30):**  arise, that we're supporting in the United States a different way to bridge the knowledge  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:35):**  gap than what the chemical industries have given us.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:39):**  And that we really support each other to have solutions that are decentralized, not patented  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:45):**  and not just proprietary.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:47):**  Yeah, thanks.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:49):**  Good question.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:51):**  Okay, so now we've covered all of the bad news.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:56):**  These are the things that are in your way that are causing this to be difficult to implement  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:00):**  or to grow.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:01):**  Let's talk about some of the things that have given you hope or inspired you that things  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:05):**  are starting to move in the right direction.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:07):**  Oromo, what have you seen in your line of work that has given you that hope?  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:15):**  So to me, what gives me a lot of hope is that now we are talking about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:21):**  in fashion a lot more, not a lot, you know, in objective terms, we should talk about it  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:27):**  much more, but a lot more.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:29):**  And I feel like this has been a change.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:33):**  And I would love to hear from you, Rebecca, when do you think, you know, you saw this  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:39):**  change.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:40):**  I've seen a massive change in the last two years, which is since we've been working on  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:45):**  it.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:46):**  And I don't know if it's like I'm looking harder at it, but really, when we started  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:50):**  that trace, it was very difficult to find people holding this conversation.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:54):**  Fibershed, I would say, was the only one.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:58):**  And suddenly, in the last years, thanks to the work of like the Savory Institute and  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:06):**  some very big fashion brands, obviously Patagonia, some very big fashion brands are starting  
**[0:49:11-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:11):**  this conversation of how they can embed, you know, like environmental regeneration and  
**[0:49:17-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:17):**  regenerative agriculture in their supply chains.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:21):**  And I think that's really important because, you know, ultimately, they are the people  
**[0:49:26-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:26):**  that have the microphone in a lot of occasions and a, you know, just putting these in the  
**[0:49:33-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:33):**  conversation and their ability to reach consumers with this message is really important because  
**[0:49:40-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:40):**  I mean, we here all understand, you know, that a nature based solutions are key to fighting  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:48):**  climate change and that regenerative agriculture has a very important role.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:52):**  But most of the of the mindset and the conversation around sustainability is in damaging this  
**[0:49:58-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:58):**  and not in actually healing and repairing.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:02):**  And the fact that we are starting to see, you know, like in different industries, these  
**[0:50:06-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:06):**  pockets and these like organizations that are really amplifying the, you know, the potential  
**[0:50:15-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:15):**  of regenerative agriculture and the potential to heal our planet.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:21):**  It gives me so much hope, you know, it just feels like there is momentum and lots of good  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:28):**  things can happen from this.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:29):**  Like, as Rebecca is saying, if we if we get the right people around the table and we and  
**[0:50:34-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:34):**  we make sure that we get the right policies around the table.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:37):**  Nicely said.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:38):**  I agree.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:39):**  We've got a lot of traction that's starting to build with conversations like this, where  
**[0:50:44-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:44):**  we're bridging regenerative ag and fashion.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:46):**  I mean, these are new conversations.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:50):**  I mean, some you'll see some brands who are kind of coming out the gate with with claims  
**[0:50:56-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:56):**  and comments and and work.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:59):**  And, you know, I see all of it as a gradient.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:02):**  Like we we just need to keep pushing on the leading edge of the work all the time.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:07):**  And hopefully hopefully, you know, just a few good players keep being really good role  
**[0:51:13-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:13):**  models for what this can look like.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:16):**  We can keep setting the foundations for everyone to kind of jump on board who may not have  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:22):**  been having the privilege to pay enough attention to the sector, which would be the wearer.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:26):**  In those cases, they don't have the time.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:30):**  They're going to need to trust some of the new transparency tools that we bring in place  
**[0:51:35-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:35):**  and localized, localized, localized.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:38):**  So you can walk in those fields and understand what's happening.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:41):**  The distance between the wearer and the field is a is a chasm that needs to be bridged because  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:48):**  ultimately we need to have sensitivity for how these things are grown and produced.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:53):**  But anyway.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:55):**  So, you know, I think we should be, should I be answering anything in the chat?  
**[0:51:57-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:57):**  There's some brilliant questions in here.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:59):**  There's some really good questions.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:00):**  And we're going to start with them real soon.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:02):**  I want to ask one last question before we turn it over to listener questions.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:06):**  And that is, how can people who are not directly involved in the fashion industry or the textile  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:12):**  or the farming industry help to move the needle in the right direction in this entire, this  
**[0:52:18-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:18):**  dire aspect of our culture?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:21):**  Rebecca.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:22):**  Oh, how to move the needle if you're not already involved in the industry.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:29):**  Well, I think right now there's opportunities to, again, just keep your clothing in play.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:35):**  So whatever you're wearing, there's a wonderful Tiwa Pueblo tribal elder or leader, I would  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:43):**  say he's not quite yet an elder.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:48):**  And so anyway, I was just hearing stories about cotton production in the Southwest before  
**[0:52:53-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:53):**  the land was colonized and clothing made of this cotton was considered sacred and clothing  
**[0:53:01-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:01):**  had a sentience to it.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:03):**  And I've told this story before, but I keep coming back to this idea that we aren't putting  
**[0:53:08-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:08):**  enough attention and respect into the actual garments, that they're protecting us, that  
**[0:53:13-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:13):**  they're keeping us warm and in comfortable environments, that we can have these social  
**[0:53:19-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:19):**  engagements without being unclothed.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:21):**  I mean, these fundamental, they seem like laughable realities, but really textile is  
**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:27):**  shelter.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:28):**  And so I think part of it is just if everyone kind of thanks their clothing, like a little  
**[0:53:34-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:34):**  gratitude for the service that the clothing offers, I think that's the indigenous heartbeat,  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:40):**  you know, start with gratitude, start with thanks for whatever clothing you have, regardless  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:44):**  of its fiber content and work to keep it in play.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:49):**  And then from there, if you buy new or secondhand, you know, look even in the secondhand market,  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:55):**  look for clothing that's a hundred percent natural so that those fibers, you know, the  
**[0:54:00-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:00):**  more used plastic garment is, the more it fragments those fibers into the ecosystem.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:08):**  So even when you're buying secondhand, look for natural, if you can foster clothing swaps  
**[0:54:14-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:14):**  in your community to keep clothing in play.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:16):**  And then lastly, if you buy new and you have that opportunity and privilege, then look  
**[0:54:21-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:21):**  for people you can support in your home community.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:25):**  And if you can't support people in your home community or brands that are somewhat local  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:29):**  and transparent to you, and you have to go to the certification body, I mean, definitely  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:34):**  it's helpful to look for an organic certification.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:38):**  I'm not going to say that that's not helpful, but GOTS, global organic trade certification,  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:42):**  there's, you know, it's better than, it's the best we have.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:47):**  So we'll just go with that.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:50):**  And we have a lot of work to do on certifications and transparency as a whole, but those would  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:57):**  be my recommends.  
**[0:54:58-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:59):**  And I will echo most of that.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:01):**  I think, I think what fashion offers is that really the possibility that everybody can  
**[0:55:07-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:07):**  get engaged in moving the needle because we all wear clothes, you know, as far as I know.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:13):**  So it's, it's really about, I think first reconnecting because often, you know, we,  
**[0:55:19-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:19):**  we think of, Oh, I'll just buy better.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:21):**  No, but yeah, it's not about buying, but like first reconnecting with our wardrobe, what  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:25):**  we have at home, there is a really cool organization.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:30):**  They are actually like a student collective who prepared like a wardrobe audit tool that  
**[0:55:39-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:39):**  is called like closed mass index.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:41):**  And it is real templates that you sit with in front of your wardrobe.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:46):**  And you really try to understand what's in there, you know, and like understand the journeys  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:51):**  behind the products and you take the labels and you understand what they are made of.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:55):**  And you understand where they were made of.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:57):**  And I went through that actually not so long ago, and it was such an empowering thing because  
**[0:56:03-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:03):**  he gave me a lot of information.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:06):**  Most of it's pretty unpleasant about what was sitting in my wardrobe, but also it really  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:10):**  recommitted me to, to just honoring my clothes and keeping them in use for as long as possible.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:16):**  And it also taught me what is it that is in my wardrobe that is actually really damaging  
**[0:56:22-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:22):**  because it's, you know, it's synthetic fibers and I need to be careful about how I wash  
**[0:56:27-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:27):**  them.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:28):**  And I need to be careful about how I dispose of them because they are effectively, you  
**[0:56:32-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:32):**  know, like shedding microfibers forever.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:34):**  So I think understanding our clothes help us understand how to take care of them.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:39):**  So we can minimize the impact that they're having on the environment now.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:43):**  And also it can extend their life cycle, you know, and I think it's very beautiful to start  
**[0:56:48-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:48):**  learning again, understand, because many of us don't know, you know, like how, how, how  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:52):**  to wash your clothes, you know, in the best way to really extend their life and minimize  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:57):**  the impact.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:58):**  So I think it's first connecting with what you have at home and then really looking to  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:04):**  different ways of interacting with this industry.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:08):**  So avoiding to buy new products as much as possible, which really should be always like,  
**[0:57:14-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:14):**  I own a fashion brand, but I don't buy new clothes since like three years ago.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:19):**  But like when, and when you want to buy something new, really vote with your dollar, you know,  
**[0:57:26-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:26):**  like a vote and, and go with brands that align with your values.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:32):**  And I think there's something really powerful about like, I don't know, connecting our,  
**[0:57:36-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:36):**  our, our values with sort of correcting our actions with our values.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:42):**  And it's quite empowering to know, like, you know, I've supported this brand that, that  
**[0:57:45-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:45):**  I think is very cool.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:47):**  And now I have a piece that represents these.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:50):**  It's like building a collection.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:52):**  Yeah, of stories, you know?  
**[0:57:55-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:56):**  A great set of stories and memories and meaning.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:59):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:01):**  It seems like with all these purchases and these decisions, you are building a collection.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:06):**  It's a matter of what kind of collection do you want to build?  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:09):**  And what does that collection represent?  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:11):**  What does it say about you and your priorities and what you invest in?  
**[0:58:15-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:15):**  Because as we covered in just a small part here, there are effects to all of these decisions  
**[0:58:22-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:22):**  at many, many stages of the process before it gets to you.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:25):**  And certainly before it goes on to decompose or, you know, an afterlife on its own.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:32):**  Now let's hand things over.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:35):**  Sorry, no, one last thing that I wanted to mention is also, and it really depends on  
**[0:58:40-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:40):**  how much we each want to get engaged, but you know, my journey is that I started going  
**[0:58:44-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:44):**  down the tunnel and I ended up here.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:46):**  So you know, like there's always like when we want to go the extra step, there are so  
**[0:58:51-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:51):**  many options to really demand transparency and demand change from brands.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:56):**  And I do think that makes a big difference.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:58):**  So for example, Fashion Revolution on their website has a template where it just takes  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:03):**  you two seconds to go pick your brand and it sends them an email saying like, I want  
**[0:59:09-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:09):**  to know who made my clothes, you know, and like what's behind my clothes.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:12):**  And I think like the more that brands get these requests from customers or potential  
**[0:59:17-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:17):**  customers, the more they will understand that really, you know, their model needs to change.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:23):**  And you know, there is a template for that, but there's always, you know, the possibility  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:27):**  of emailing a brand and being like, listen, I really like this piece, but I want to understand  
**[0:59:32-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:32):**  what's made of or where was it made.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:34):**  And yeah, and I think that's cool as consumers that we take that extra step.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:40):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:41):**  Great.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:42):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:43):**  Well, look, there's so much more that we can cover here, but I want to hand it over to  
**[0:59:46-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:46):**  the listeners.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:47):**  And before we go to them, I'd also like to encourage our participants to check out the  
**[0:59:50-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:50):**  video replay on Climate Farmers YouTube channel shortly after this call, and also to look  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:56):**  out for the broadcast of this panel discussion on the Regenerative Skills podcast, where  
**[1:00:01-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:01):**  along with the weekly episodes that I publish, our expert panel discussions will come out  
**[1:00:05-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:05):**  once a month.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:06):**  Our previous one on regenerative agriculture is coming out this week.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:10):**  If we're not able to get to your questions this time, or if you're watching the recorded  
**[1:00:15-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:15):**  version later on, just remember that the conversation will continue on our Mighty Networks page.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:20):**  And I'm putting that link in the chat now.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:22):**  And also, of course, if you rewatch this later on YouTube, we'll have the link in the show  
**[1:00:26-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:26):**  notes.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:31):**  Thanks again to our two panelists, Rebecca Burgess and Aroha Alvarez Fernandez.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:35):**  We're both working tirelessly to create a healthier and more equitable fashion and textile  
**[1:00:39-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:39):**  industry around the world.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:41):**  I highly recommend that you check out their work.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:44):**  You can find Rebecca's company at Fibershed.org and Aroha's at TheTraceCollective.com.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:51):**  And a special thank you to the team at Climate Farmers for organizing the event and to all  
**[1:00:55-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:55):**  the wonderful people who showed up and participated in the chat.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:59):**  Now as great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that  
**[1:01:03-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:03):**  we covered in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and  
**[1:01:07-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:07):**  viewpoints that are out there.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:09):**  And that's why I'm inviting you to join the growing community building regenerative skills  
**[1:01:13-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:13):**  to use in their daily lives.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:15):**  It will always be free to join, all you have to do is follow the links to our Discord on  
**[1:01:20-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:20):**  the homepage of the Regenerative Skills website.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:23):**  The benefit of joining through our Discord channel is that unlike social media platforms  
**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:27):**  that mine your personal data and manipulate your feeds based on algorithms to sell you  
**[1:01:31-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:31):**  more junk, I founded these channels purely for knowledge, skill, and story exchange between  
**[1:01:37-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:37):**  people who care to make their worlds better for everyone.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:40):**  Now this week's question, which we'll be discussing on the forum is, do you know of any  
**[1:01:45-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:45):**  textile producers in your own local area?  
**[1:01:48-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:48):**  And where do they source their material and sell their products?  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:52):**  In my area for example around Barcelona, this area actually has quite a long textile manufacturing  
**[1:01:57-1:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:57):**  history.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:58):**  Throughout the 1800s and the turn of the century, there were factories that were key economies  
**[1:02:03-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:03):**  for many communities in Catalonia.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:05):**  In my own town of Santa Laulle de Ronsana, the local community center is actually a renovated  
**[1:02:10-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:10):**  old textile factory that was shut down in the 60s, which is why it's still called  
**[1:02:14-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:14):**  La Fabrica.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:16):**  I'm still learning about materials and techniques that are traditional to this area, but it's  
**[1:02:21-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:21):**  a great window into the history of land use and industries for this part of Spain where  
**[1:02:25-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:25):**  I live.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:26):**  There are so many ways to positively affect the production and consumption systems that  
**[1:02:30-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:30):**  we participate in, and I can't wait to hear about what the fiber and fashion cultures  
**[1:02:34-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:34):**  of your own area are like.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:37):**  So don't forget you can also help to guide the panel discussions that I've got planned  
**[1:02:40-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:40):**  for the future by suggesting topics and guests in the forum as well.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:44):**  Well that's our show this week, until next time keep taking those little steps every  
**[1:02:49-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:49):**  day towards a regenerative future, and I'll be right by your side along the way.

**[0:01:10-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:10):**  here in Catalunya.

**[0:01:14-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:14):**  Kallen.

**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:20):**  reforestation and agroforestry in some of the most degraded and endangered areas of  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:25):**  Europe from the Iberian peninsula, which includes Spain and Portugal, and the entire Mediterranean  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:30):**  basin, which includes many of the most popular vacation destinations on the continent, but  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:34):**  also the most rapidly desertifying areas.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:38):**  As the effects of climate change increase and become more severe, we collectively need  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:42):**  to rethink how we respond to the geographical zones at the front lines.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:47):**  Luckily, this is Sven's specialty and his life's work, and so I'll let Sven introduce  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:51):**  himself before we dive into the actionable steps to regenerate these high-risk zones.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:58):**  My name is Sven Kallen.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:01:59):**  I'm Dutch from origin.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:01):**  I've been living in several countries, but most of the time actually in Spain.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:06):**  I've been living more than 20 years in Barcelona.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:10):**  And my journey has been particularly through the international promotion of mainly Dutch  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:17):**  and Northern European technologies into Latin American Spain.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:21):**  And about 12 years ago, I made a decision to focus only on sustainability from then  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:28):**  on.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:29):**  I was feeling sort of not very motivated to just promote any type of product or any type  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:35):**  of service, and that sustainability is what really started to give more purpose to what  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:41):**  we were doing and much more satisfying job, if you like.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:47):**  So really trying to create working business models, but from a healthy point of view,  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:55):**  for all kind of stakeholders involved and for the planet, of course.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:02:59):**  And that's what we've been doing in the last 12 years.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:02):**  Now that seems like a fairly logical progression into tree planting and working with farms,  
**[0:03:07-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:07):**  but can you tell me from the leap of technology into ecology, and what made you focus on working  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:15):**  with landscape specifically?  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:19):**  I travel a lot by train originally from Barcelona to Madrid.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:24):**  And for the people that do not know that, but in between is an area around Zaragoza  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:29):**  which is called Los Monegros, which is basically Europe's biggest desert.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:33):**  And it always struck me that you think about deserts, you think about obviously the Sahel,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:39):**  Northern Africa, you think about China, you think about maybe Southern Arizona or those  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:44):**  kind of areas, or Mexico.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:46):**  But we have it right at our doorstep.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:48):**  And so every time I was on that train thinking and looking outside and thinking, wow, how  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:54):**  is it possible that not a single tree is growing here?  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:03:56):**  You see some green pockets there from time to time, which is basically corn being produced  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:00):**  with irrigated water from the Ebro River.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:03):**  And I find that very strange.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:04):**  So I started researching.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:05):**  I've also had a passion for trees, so I was naturally drawn to solutions to technologies,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:11):**  in fact, that could help to reestablish those ecosystems.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:15):**  And I came across an invention from a Dutch guy which was based around the idea of creating  
**[0:04:22-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:22):**  very local sort of unit that could hold water that would give that water or sort of seep  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:32):**  the water to the root systems in order to help that new sampling to survive the first  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:39):**  summer basically, which is always the most difficult time for a tree to get established,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:45):**  to get its root system in place and find its way around.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:50):**  And that was basically what triggered me into reforestation projects and trying to see if  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:04:57):**  we could turn this desert around into a more greener and productive area.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:02):**  And that's basically, yeah, I mean, trying to sell that story to a lot of stakeholders,  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:10):**  we got a lot of positive reactions, curiosity and saying, well, that all sounds great, but  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:16):**  it probably will not work in my type of soil, in my type of climate conditions, with my  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:21):**  type of trees.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:23):**  And so we were basically forced to look for external funding in order to demonstrate that  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:28):**  this particular device would actually work in any circumstances, in any dry land operation.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:35):**  And so then we turned to European funding.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:39):**  We found a niche in what's called the LIFE program, which is the European sort of framework  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:44):**  agreement or framework program where people can apply for all kind of different strands,  
**[0:05:52-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:05:52):**  but let's say to promote environmental activities and to demonstrate new approaches, new methodologies  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:00):**  in order to enhance nature or to enhance or to solve a particular waste problem or a emission  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:06):**  problem or it doesn't matter.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:09):**  So that's what we turned to and that turned out to be a success and also gave us a new  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:14):**  direction as a business.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:17):**  So tell me where you're at with the development of this product.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:19):**  I assume you're talking about the cocoons, the little basins that help trees to get established  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:26):**  in difficult terrain over the span of their first year primarily, right?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:31):**  Right.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:32):**  So initially this was made of plastic, hard plastic.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:36):**  And we saw from the beginning that, I mean, from a functional point of view, it worked  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:41):**  very well, but it was very clear that people love to plant trees and to put that device  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:48):**  around it, but they didn't like to come back.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:50):**  People are not very geared towards maintenance and towards coming back and removing things  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:54):**  and cleaning that up.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:06:55):**  And so at some point we started seeing broken plastic, lids flying off because of strong  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:02):**  winds and, you know, really littering the landscape.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:04):**  So that was not a good solution.

**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:13):**  in order for the cardboard to be resistant enough to hold the water.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:18):**  And that has basically went through a couple of cycles of improvement also thanks to European  
**[0:07:23-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:23):**  programs among others, the FTI cocoon project sponsored by the Horizon 2020 program in order  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:31):**  to increase its durability.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:33):**  You can just imagine animals walking past or even humans accidentally stepping on a  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:41):**  cardboard lid.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:42):**  Of course that breaks very easily or a lot of rain pounding on top of it really weakens  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:47):**  very rapidly any cardboard structure.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:50):**  So the company involved, which is called Landlife Company, that holds the design of the cocoon  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:55):**  together with our help.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:07:58):**  And we really helped them implement that system in Spain.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:03):**  Took a lot of improvements in order to get to the actual version that it is right now.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:08):**  So I'll definitely put a link on the show notes for this episode so people can see what  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:11):**  the cocoon looks like.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:12):**  But can you describe it for our listeners?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:15):**  How is it shaped and why is that shape selected for the function that it serves?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:20):**  So people compare it to basically to a donut, if you like.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:23):**  So it's a 50cm diameter shape, 25cm high.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:28):**  And what you need is you have to make a bigger hole, a planting hole, than you normally would  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:33):**  do with a normal tree.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:34):**  In the middle of course goes the tree, the sapling itself.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:38):**  And then around it you place that donut and you fill it with about 20-25 liters of water.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:44):**  Ensure it's well stabilized.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:45):**  You close the lid, you put a protector on top.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:48):**  If you have one available and you basically try to cover it around it with soil so that  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:53):**  the lid doesn't fly off.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:55):**  And that's it, and you're done.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:08:58):**  And this allows the water to very slowly seep into directly the roots of this tree that's  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:03):**  trying to get established?  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:05):**  Yes, so the difference between conventional irrigation, even if it would be drip irrigation,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:12):**  is that you drip the water at the root, at the top, at the soil level of where the tree  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:20):**  is placed.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:23):**  Which to a lot of theories makes the tree, let's say, sort of lazy, a very comfortable  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:28):**  position because it doesn't have to work its root system.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:31):**  On the other hand, if you put the water at a lower level, so you basically, what you're  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:37):**  trying to do is to restore the water column.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:42):**  You create sort of a moisty capillary column below the tree.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:48):**  You give these roots the opportunity to slowly find their way down and give them incentive  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:54):**  to grow deep.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:56):**  And that is what the cocoon does very well.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:09:58):**  And you see actually if you dig out a tree after a few years, you see an incredible root  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:03):**  development below that.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:04):**  So I mean the cocoon is only a temporary help.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:09):**  After two months, three months, typically the lid starts to crumble.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:13):**  And then people come to me and say, hell, it's broken.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:16):**  But it's actually the purpose of it.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:17):**  It has to start degrading at some point.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:21):**  What will remain inside that planting hole is the, let's say, the lid and it compacts  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:31):**  the area around it.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:32):**  So it still remains an important area to capture rainwater in the next rainy season.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:38):**  And so that hole will be replenished.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:41):**  And that water column will stay intact.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:43):**  Because on the other hand, the bottom of the cocoon obviously covers the soil.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:48):**  So that basically helps to prevent evaporation of the moist below it.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:52):**  So you'll be really creating their capillary column in which the plant can thrive.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:10:57):**  Now, I've seen a couple of different iterations of products like this.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:02):**  Like you mentioned, the first ones were plastic.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:04):**  They've since evolved into this biodegradable cardboard.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:08):**  Does it have any other features?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:09):**  I know some are inoculated with mycelium spores to help the root systems.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:15):**  Are there any other features about this besides the structure itself?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:19):**  Not for the moment at the project called Cocoon.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:23):**  What we try to do is to innovate around the tree itself.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:27):**  So on the one hand, we try to plant with different types of soil amendments.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:33):**  We can think about biochar, which has a very interesting behavior helping new trees to  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:40):**  get established and to act as a sponge also for water, which is particularly important  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:46):**  in very dry conditions.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:48):**  We can add mycorrhizae either at the Grove Stadium in the nurseries or at mycorrhizae  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:11:56):**  at the moment that you plant, so below the root system.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:00):**  We also work with all kinds of other soil bacteria in order to basically help to get  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:06):**  soil life going again and to give these roots enough stimulus and help to get established,  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:13):**  because that's basically what it is about.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:16):**  Try to get that root system going and then the plant should be able to survive by itself.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:21):**  And so you've got tons of different planting projects going on all over the place.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:25):**  Can you tell me about some of the different operations and what the objectives are?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:29):**  Is it always just reforestation or is it also with an agricultural objective as well?  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:34):**  Well, we are involved now as Volterra in a number of live projects.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:39):**  Not all of them are focused on reforestation, but let's say the ones that do, they have  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:45):**  a strong component of looking at ecosystem restoration.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:50):**  So we're really trying to take a holistic view and look at the land and see what can  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:55):**  be worth doing there.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:12:57):**  So there are situations in which, for example, the land has been burned, which needs sort  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:04):**  of a mixed forest approach with bushes, with pioneering trees, with deciduous trees in  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:11):**  order to regenerate or to help the acceleration of the regeneration.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:17):**  And then we also work with agroforestry.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:19):**  So a farmer wants to convert his land to become more resilient towards the effects of climate  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:25):**  change, we have increasing periods of droughts, we have ongoing erosion, we have lots of problems  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:31):**  on the land, sometimes even sterile lands that are completely wasted things, too many  
**[0:13:37-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:37):**  years of fertilizer or very heavy use of pesticides or of herbicides.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:45):**  And so to turn that land around, trees can play a very interesting role in that.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:49):**  And on the one hand, of course, improve your business model on the other hand, because  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:13:53):**  it's not about just restoring the land, but also see if your trees can help pave that.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:00):**  Now one of the things that you and I first talked about when we actually had a Zoom call

**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:09):**  are pretty common, right?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:11):**  Maybe it's an organization like a business or a nonprofit and they'll say, OK, we're

**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:19):**  And they go in with some group of people and a bunch of purchase trees and they throw them  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:24):**  all on the ground.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:25):**  And what happens after that?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:27):**  And you had quite a few insights as well as criticisms the way most tree planting initiatives  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:32):**  are executed.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:36):**  Traditionally in Spain, the contractors for reforestation projects were hired on the number  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:44):**  of trees planted.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:45):**  So the only criterion was you had to show that, let's say, with a typical density of  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:52):**  800 or 1000 trees per hectare times 25 hectares, let's say in this example that you had placed  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:14:59):**  25,000 trees in the ground.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:01):**  Now it didn't matter really if those trees would die off next year or what would happen  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:07):**  to them.

**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:11):**  And also we're pushing for deals with long term maintenance in which we try to think  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:17):**  about what you plant where.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:19):**  So you try to get to the right tree in the right place concept, forward thinking.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:24):**  Let's think 30 or 50 years ahead and look at the climate scenarios for particular regions.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:30):**  It's now very well defined what's going to happen or most probably is going to happen  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:34):**  in terms of precipitation, in terms of your amount of days in which the rain falls, which  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:41):**  is typically every year less or every cycle less and less days per year.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:45):**  So you have more importance of retaining water for as long as possible.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:51):**  What about late frost, which is now a particular phenomenon happening in a lot of places in  
**[0:15:55-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:15:55):**  Europe, particularly harming now, for example, in France, the wine industry, for example.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:03):**  But this is happening in many countries.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:05):**  So we-  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:06):**  Definitely heard about it here as well.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:07):**  I mean, I think it was earlier this year that a lot of the stone fruit harvest was already  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:11):**  damaged from a late frost.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:12):**  Correct.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:13):**  So you need to go towards in terms of species selection to probably different criteria if  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:19):**  you want to ensure that we have.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:20):**  And this is, I mean, probably for fruit use is a different thing because they have cycles  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:24):**  of 15 years, 14 years, 16 years.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:26):**  While if you're trying to really recover a piece of damaged land into, let's say, more  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:32):**  forest style approach, you need to think 50, 70 or 80 years ahead or even longer those  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:38):**  cycles.

**[0:16:49-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:49):**  on what is your selection of species and how can you maybe think ahead and look at species  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:16:58):**  that are now thriving in areas that are under those conditions to where your terrain is  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:03):**  going maybe in 30 or 50 years.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:06):**  And then we come to a very interesting and controversial theme, which is called assisted  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:10):**  migration of species.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:12):**  I mean, animals can travel north because that typically, the effect of climate change is  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:18):**  moving from south to north.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:21):**  But trees cannot and bushes cannot.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:23):**  I mean, there's no time for these species to adapt themselves to the ongoing rhythm  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:29):**  actually.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:30):**  So that's one of the themes of our most recent project is assisted migration and see how  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:37):**  we can experiment in a controlled way to ensure that what we plant now is still there in 50  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:44):**  years.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:45):**  And let's talk about some of the reasons why these initiatives are necessary in the first  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:50):**  place.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:51):**  So, first of all, causing the degradation of especially the areas around the Mediterranean.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:17:55):**  I think this is mostly what we're talking about, but also the interior of Spain and  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:01):**  the precursors to getting us where we're at now.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:05):**  Well, I'm not a...  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:09):**  I suppose it's different in a lot of different regions.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:12):**  They each have their own land use histories, but in general.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:16):**  In general, I would say that in the Mediterranean countries that have been suffering, I mean,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:20):**  historically always from very strong summers and typically irregular periods of rain.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:26):**  I mean, the expression when it rains, it pours, that is very designed for Spain and certainly  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:32):**  Italy, for example, in Greece.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:34):**  And so that has always been here, but let's say the intensity has been growing over the  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:39):**  last 20 years for sure.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:42):**  And on the other hand, there's a lot of investment being done in irrigation practices.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:46):**  So I think between 80 and 85% of the water use in Spain is for agriculture, for irrigation.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:52):**  But that only covers 10% of the surface, the rest is dryland farming.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:18:56):**  So imagine the pressure on aquifers has been tremendous.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:00):**  And so if the general level of aquifers drops in a country, then of course the rest of the  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:06):**  crops are going to have more difficulty in thriving.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:11):**  And therefore what you see is, and then you have this increasingly people drawing on wells  
**[0:19:16-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:16):**  with salinization problems, which then sort of gets a compounded effect where, you know,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:24):**  okay, we're having a higher solution, we have a higher, we have a bigger problem of salinization,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:30):**  let's throw more water on it.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:32):**  That's, those type of practices have been allowed for many, many years.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:37):**  That's now changing and it's being rationalized and getting better.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:40):**  There's a lot of damage done.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:42):**  And then you see if you go to Murcia or you go to Castilla Mancha, even now close to Madrid,  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:49):**  and you see basically what we could call the frontier of climate change basically cropping  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:19:55):**  up with hundreds of meters or even kilometers, people say, every so many years in which you  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:00):**  basically see the whole country drying out.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:04):**  And that's basically the compounding effect of what has been happening over the last 50  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:08):**  years probably together with the global effects of climate change.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:12):**  So you have to arm yourself as a landowner.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:16):**  So what are we going to do?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:17):**  And I think the biggest answer there is shade, trying to create cover.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:22):**  So there's a lot of experience with cover crops in regular agriculture with direct seeding,  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:28):**  you know, not plowing anymore in order to prevent oxidation of the soil, but also a

**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:38):**  Let's walk through the assessment of a piece of land that you're perhaps going into for  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:44):**  someone who is interested in planting trees.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:47):**  What are the main things or points of data or site analysis that you do to determine  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:20:54):**  the strategy and the species you're going to select to try and plant in those areas?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:02):**  So we basically work with a questionnaire that we try to sort of get answered by the  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:08):**  landowner.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:09):**  It goes from former use to future use.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:13):**  So the desires of the landowner, what does he or she want?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:16):**  We look at, we always take some soil samples to see, you know, the type of soil averages.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:24):**  You look at the compactation, you look at slope, you look at water availability, so  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:28):**  you look at a number of factors, you look at existing forest in the surroundings or  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:34):**  species that are doing well or maybe are more vulnerable, and then that gives you a pretty  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:40):**  good picture of what's there, what's the baseline situation.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:43):**  And then looking at future desires of the landowner, yeah, you basically start to make  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:50):**  a list of potential species that could do well under the existing and forecasted situation.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:21:56):**  And then of course you have to, together, sort of come to a conclusion of what's acceptable  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:01):**  and what's available.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:02):**  The nurseries, they get lots of, you know, sub-questions around it, but that's basically  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:08):**  the process.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:10):**  And when it comes to implementing a project, let's say you've written out this questionnaire,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:15):**  you've got the answers that you need, walk me through the implementation process.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:19):**  For example, where do you source trees from and how do you bring together the amount of  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:23):**  people, assuming this is going to be like a community event rather than a contract for  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:28):**  someone?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:29):**  Yeah, I think it's the right moment now to mention our star project that we call it,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:35):**  which is called Life Terra, of which we're very proud, because we got a lot of requests  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:40):**  from landowners in the last years that indeed would love to have their terrain reforested  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:45):**  or have trees around it or in particular zones.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:49):**  And we also, on the other hand, get a lot of requests that started with friends and  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:52):**  family but that also moved to companies calling us saying, hey, you're doing something with  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:56):**  trees, can we come out and help to plant those?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:22:59):**  And so those are two very interesting phenomena.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:01):**  I mean, the landowner typically has a vision of where he or she wants to go, but might  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:05):**  not have the money or the resources available to put those trees on the land.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:10):**  On the other hand, there's companies and collectives, schools interested to get involved.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:16):**  And so we try to mix that into Life Terra.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:18):**  And that is a very ambitious reforestation project or tree planting project, I should  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:23):**  say, because there's a difference between reforestation and afforestation.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:26):**  But let's say a tree planting project focused on allowing, facilitating the planting of  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:31):**  500 million trees in Europe in the next coming five years.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:35):**  One, so allowing each citizen, European citizen, to plant his or her own tree.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:40):**  And that's a very exciting project.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:42):**  We started that last year.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:44):**  And that is actually about trying to help landowners to accelerate the greening of their  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:49):**  land with trees.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:50):**  And then all these elements of what we learned over the last few years is coming together.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:55):**  And we're not doing that alone.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:23:56):**  We're doing that with a number of partners, more than 16 partners across eight countries  
**[0:24:01-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:01):**  in Europe and slowly implementing that into tree planting events with, like I said, schools,  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:10):**  citizens, groups of companies and yeah, very, very good reactions.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:16):**  Also landowners very happy that actually there's actually now being that's actually being done  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:21):**  instead of just talking about it.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:23):**  That's really exciting.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:24):**  Can you tell me about where you're sourcing trees from?  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:27):**  Is it easy to find the species that you're looking for or is it difficult to source or  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:34):**  at least the scale that you're talking about, the types of native species or the species  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:41):**  that you've come to decide on based on that assessment of thinking maybe a couple of decades  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:47):**  forward?  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:50):**  We work in each country with dedicated nurseries that have a track record on producing a number,  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:56):**  a wide variety of trees.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:24:59):**  And just in the first season to give you an idea, we've planted almost 100 different species  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:05):**  in more than seven events.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:07):**  So that's a very exciting number.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:08):**  I mean, we always in every project we try to promote at least eight different species,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:13):**  but then we started counting them all together or what happened in different countries and  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:16):**  it's close to 100.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:17):**  So that's very exciting in terms of biodiversity and what we try to contribute to the local  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:21):**  environment.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:22):**  Having said that, these nurseries typically produce a couple of million plants per year.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:28):**  So we are now at our first year, we did close to 150,000 trees, which is not making a big  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:36):**  dent into their operation.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:38):**  So there's widely available.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:39):**  But of course, moving forward to next year, we have to go plant more than a million and  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:44):**  a half.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:45):**  So scale that 10 times.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:47):**  Then it can become critical for some nurseries.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:49):**  And then in year three, when we have to go to 15 to 20 million trees per year, then that  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:54):**  will become critical.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:25:55):**  So we are now looking with a number of European based suppliers or nurseries to see if they  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:02):**  meet the criteria.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:05):**  And the criteria are obviously produced with the least possible fertilizers in the cleanest  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:14):**  conditions possible, but also that they are able to produce hardened trees.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:18):**  And with hardened, I mean, not trees that have been super comfortable in nursery, like  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:23):**  always irrigated, you know, to me, particularly in very challenging conditions like in Spain  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:29):**  and Italy and also in Greece and Portugal, we have to look for nurseries that are sort  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:35):**  of hardening off the plants at the last few months before they go into the field, meaning  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:40):**  that they give them water but not too much.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:44):**  Periods in which they shut off the water in order to really make the plant more resilient  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:48):**  and more sort of, yeah, resilient.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:52):**  That's actually the word I'm looking for.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:26:54):**  To ensure that when they go into the ground, that they are, you know, genetically predisposed  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:00):**  or yeah, able to react to those challenging conditions.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:06):**  Because you can just imagine any soil that's active at that moment when you plant a new

**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:15):**  So the tree really has to not only survive by itself, but also to fend off a lot of adversary  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:21):**  in his surroundings.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:24):**  What are some of the biggest challenges or roadblocks in your way for meeting the lofty  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:28):**  ambitions that you have for the coming years?  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:32):**  Five in a million trees is a lot of trees, but if you would all add them up and you would  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:38):**  all plant them next together, let's say, in one single project, it would basically cover  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:43):**  a big province in the Netherlands or it could cover a province in Italy.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:48):**  So it seems like a lot, and it is a lot, but it's also not like, it's not that we're gonna  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:54):**  put trees everywhere in Europe, right?  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:27:55):**  I mean, we're not colonizing all of Europe everywhere with trees.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:01):**  So if we look at that scale, but still, it is gonna be challenging to find the right  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:06):**  locations in order to plant those trees.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:09):**  And so that's our biggest challenge to find the right land that really needs trees and  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:13):**  where trees can make a difference in terms of local biodiversity, in terms of erosion,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:18):**  in contention, in terms of clean air, what have you.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:23):**  So we're looking a lot at green belts, for example, around cities.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:26):**  That's also easy because of logistics where people can, you know, could even walk or cycle  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:30):**  to the planting events, which would be a very nice aspect of it.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:35):**  We're looking at farmers to offer them trees to, like I said before, that they can implement  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:41):**  more easily or with less cost, a foresty concept, for example.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:45):**  And then of course, there's also areas that have been really torn by either forest fires  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:50):**  or really severely degraded because of climate change.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:53):**  I mean, look at Germany, look at France, we have huge tracts of land, thousands of hectares  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:28:59):**  being attacked by bark beetle and other all kinds of plagues.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:03):**  And these were typically planted in the last century, monocultures, it was always going  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:09):**  right.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:10):**  But every year, same cycle, every period, it was the same cycle of trees.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:16):**  And that's now no longer possible.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:18):**  We have to move to mixed forests with more adventurous trees, if that's the right word.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:23):**  And so the second challenge, the first challenge is land.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:26):**  Second challenge would probably be what are we going to plant?  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:29):**  So to ensure that what I said about before, the right tree in the right place that we  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:34):**  can actually make that happen.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:36):**  Okay, so from the other side of that, from people listening, how can they contact you  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:42):**  and either apply to have their land forested or apply to participate and help plant trees  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:48):**  directly?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:50):**  So at lifetera.eu, we have both, we can accommodate both the landowners and citizens interested.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:29:58):**  We're not live yet in all European countries.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:00):**  So for now we are live in eight countries and for the coming season, that starts in  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:05):**  October, November, we hope to be live in 10 countries.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:09):**  And so any citizen that is interested or school, we have also have a schooling program, they  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:15):**  can contact us through the website.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:16):**  And on the other hand, landowners of course are more than welcome to upload their file,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:22):**  basically the KML information where they are, and then we'll send them a questionnaire to  
**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:27):**  which they can respond on former use, what do they want, what type of density are they  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:34):**  looking at, what type of trees are they looking at, and then we can see if we can work together  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:38):**  and make it happen.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:39):**  Super exciting.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:40):**  Now, there's one more aspect of what you do that I'm really interested in because you  
**[0:30:44-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:44):**  also help to kind of give assistance to entrepreneurs who are doing ecologically minded projects.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:52):**  I mean, I've talked to Thomas from Massilio before and I know that you've been closely  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:30:58):**  assisting this project in getting established and looking at all the different aspects of  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:03):**  the enterprises that can be not only profitable but also assist in managing the ecology of  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:08):**  the farm where they're at.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:10):**  Tell me about how this kind of came about and how you started working with this project.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:16):**  Yes.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:18):**  We try to, at Voltaire, we try to like take a holistic view on new projects.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:25):**  And so, you know, there's typically a lot of enthusiasm from the entrepreneurs and always  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:32):**  a lack of money.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:33):**  And this is, I think, is sort of a global issue.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:38):**  And so what we try to do every time that there is a potential project, like in this case  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:42):**  in Taverteht, which is a fantastic living lab, if you like, of everything that has to  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:48):**  do with regenerative agriculture and with sustainable forest management, try to sort  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:53):**  of put different actors together, see if we can find funding for that.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:31:58):**  That was thanks to the live micro-restore funding.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:02):**  And then see if we can make these entities work together in a strategic way.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:05):**  So try to not invite free competitors but really people that are in different parts  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:10):**  of the value chain and see how they can come together and make their own businesses grow.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:17):**  So that's just again coming back to the original idea of creating business models around nature  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:22):**  restoration projects.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:23):**  And yeah, that seems to work very, very nicely.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:26):**  So it's a fantastic outcome for us that this is happening and growing in Taverteht.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:33):**  Tell me where you're hoping that these different projects are going to be in the next couple  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:37):**  of years.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:38):**  What are you trying to accomplish in the short term?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:41):**  So the short term, I would say that these projects have to become economically viable  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:47):**  by themselves.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:48):**  So if we don't have to lie awake at night to see if we can pay the salaries, that would  
**[0:32:52-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:32:52):**  be a very important milestone for these companies to in order to these initiatives thrive and  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:01):**  can just grow in their respective ways.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:04):**  That would be one.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:06):**  And then for the 500 million trees projects, of course, we put that incredible goal and  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:13):**  that is basically occupying us with a lot of our energy and a lot of our time.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:20):**  And that basically means that we hope to energize a lot of actors that are now trying to become  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:26):**  involved in climate action, but might not have the means or wouldn't know where to go,  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:31):**  wouldn't know how to do it.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:32):**  And we want to help and canalize that energy and money also that's often behind it and  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:37):**  see how we can, you know, really get that done in the next five years.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:42):**  So that would be a fantastic outcome.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:45):**  Let's end on a note of potential.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:48):**  Tell me what is possible when we start to envision a path forward, both for business,  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:33:57):**  for communities and for individuals of stewardship and collaboration with nature rather than

**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:34:23):**  It's a bit of an ideological vision perhaps, but what I've seen with, for example, agroforestry  
**[0:34:28-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:34:28):**  projects but also food forest, which is even more dense, if you like, in terms of...  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:34:35):**  But I think food forest around cities could be the answer to a lot of our problems.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:34:41):**  It basically becomes a fully self-cycling system of nutrients and of nuts and fruits  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:34:50):**  and vegetables and wood.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:34:54):**  And so there's a lot of elements that can come out of there that would perfectly serve  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:34:58):**  Europe and the rest of the world.

**[0:35:01-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:35:01):**  It would give us jobs, it would give us access to food, to medicine, to shade, to clean water,  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:35:09):**  clean air.

**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:35:15):**  It's a marvelous vision.

**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sven-kallen-on-how-to-restore-the-dry-and-degraded-lands-of-europe/#t=0:35:26):**  other projects going on.

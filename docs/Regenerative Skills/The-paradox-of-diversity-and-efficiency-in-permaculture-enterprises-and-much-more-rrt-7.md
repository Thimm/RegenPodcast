**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:26):**  Alright good morning and welcome back everybody to another regenerative round table.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:30):**  As always I'm sitting here with my buddy and colleague Neil Haggerty and we don't  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:34):**  have another guest for you today because we're going to be focusing a lot more on  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:38):**  the systems and the processes that we're doing here on the development of our own farm.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:43):**  How you doing this morning Neil?  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:44):**  It's only seven o'clock, we're getting started early.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:46):**  Hey Oliver, hey everybody, I'm tired.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:51):**  I'm tired, it's been a long week.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:53):**  I don't know what to tell you.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:55):**  Understandable, there's been a lot going on here.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:02:59):**  So why don't we jump in and talk about some of the projects that we've been going through  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:03):**  over the last couple of weeks.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:06):**  Maybe starting with this new focus that we've had to put on security.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:10):**  Talk a little bit about how that came to be such a priority and some of the steps that  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:14):**  we have been taking in order to shore up this place as far as security is concerned.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:21):**  Well like yeah really state of the art stuff in terms of security.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:27):**  We're putting doors in our house which we don't have right now.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:31):**  So you might want to write that down, that's doors.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:35):**  Yeah we have a house with no doors and you know that's not ideal.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:42):**  We do have like some nice stuff and we live in a third world country where there's a lot  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:47):**  of poverty.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:49):**  We live in a really nice community here and you know people are so respectful, so friendly  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:03:56):**  but alcohol and drug abuse are present.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:00):**  There's like a small percentage I would say of the, you know life is tough here for a  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:05):**  lot of people but especially the people who've like gotten the wrong side of that kind of  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:10):**  thing.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:11):**  Alcohol seems to affect the indigenous people here very strongly and so petty theft is an  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:18):**  issue.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:19):**  It just you know people drink, they get desperate and they'll take just about anything which  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:26):**  can be kind of frustrating at times because I've had you know I've had things like little  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:31):**  little saplings on projects that I manage near here get stolen you know.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:35):**  So it's you know it's just one of those things that you got to be aware of and the temptation  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:42):**  of course that a lot of gringo communities get into here is they just put up like big  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:48):**  huge walls and they cut themselves off completely for the community.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:51):**  So we didn't really want to do that we wanted a sort of a more integral approach.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:04:57):**  Yeah and this is where it gets a little bit tricky because we are making as good of an  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:01):**  effort as we can to not close ourselves off from the community, not restrict access for  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:07):**  the locals and our other friends who come through here and either sometimes just help  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:11):**  us out with small chores in the day or come by to see the animals and that's a big part  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:16):**  of something that we want to continue to encourage here but we have to figure out a balance between  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:20):**  that and keeping some of our belongings and ourselves safe.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:24):**  So yeah like Neil said putting doors on the house is pretty key.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:28):**  Yeah that was a big breakthrough when we discovered that.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:31):**  I don't know how I nearly got robbed with that wonderful curtain that I had over the  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:37):**  doorway I mean that was nearly impenetrable but turns out we got to shore it up a little  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:43):**  bit.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:44):**  I mean just to clarify we're in the middle of building our house and we're living in  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:47):**  sort of I've been living in a tent under the roof so you know not super secure.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:54):**  Really nice though, wonderful experience I highly recommend it to anybody who's thinking  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:58):**  of starting a homestead.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:05:59):**  This last year for me has just been fantastic to wake up in a tent on my land on our land  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:04):**  every morning and you know just go through your rituals in the morning and walk around  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:11):**  and observe the place.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:12):**  It's invaluable you know and you get to be there for every stage of the development of  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:16):**  your house and your land.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:17):**  It's fantastic you know.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:20):**  Yeah but so the compromise in here is that there were a few other projects that we would  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:25):**  have liked to maybe have prioritized but because this security concern became more important  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:30):**  over the last couple of weeks we've had to shift priorities in order to just get the  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:35):**  security and being able to lock and close things up.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:39):**  We ordered a little safe so that we can store valuables and belongings and stuff in there  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:43):**  whenever we take off but really it's been it's been a challenge to think about how to  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:50):**  keep this site open and accessible to as many people as possible.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:55):**  Maybe if you have listened to some of the previous regenerative roundtables we've talked  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:06:59):**  about this access path that goes right through the middle of our farm essentially and we  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:03):**  keep going back and forth and thinking is that going to be a security concern in the  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:08):**  future?  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:09):**  Should we reroute the path the way most people do when they buy a piece of land?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:14):**  We haven't come to a final decision on this but I'm kind of of the persuasion that leaving  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:19):**  that as sort of an access route for people who already use it.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:25):**  It's already in quite a common use you see people walking past here carrying firewood  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:31):**  and you know going through other parts of the town and I like that this is something  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:36):**  that people don't feel closed off to or that we're not making kind of the more common decision  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:41):**  and just closing off our space to through traffic because there's a lot of potential  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:46):**  for inviting in the local community as well in the projects that we're doing by maintaining  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:51):**  that access route.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah it's nice you know because there are times when this place feels like a petting  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:07:58):**  zoo local kids come over.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:00):**  A lot of local kids are fascinated by the goats especially the goats but just seeing  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:07):**  the sort of goats and our pet cat and the chickens playing together and you know they  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:12):**  come in and they ask a bunch of questions and we have the whole composting system set  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:15):**  up and you know it's nice it's a sort of informal way of doing community outreach so we definitely  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:22):**  don't want to close it off and we definitely see it as more of an opportunity than a threat  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:27):**  but yeah it's all about managing those things and finding the balance right.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:33):**  Yeah definitely and the thing is security actually is much more than just restricting  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:38):**  access to the people that you know could potentially harm or or or rob us.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:45):**  We're in a fortunate kind of little micro portion of the weather system here what they  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:51):**  call the canicula which is like a little dry season within the rainy season and this one  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:08:57):**  has actually been oddly long this year and we haven't had really any significant rains  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:04):**  for over a month now aside from one instance where it rained really really heavily out  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:09):**  of nowhere and this was another sort of prompting that we need to shore up some of the things  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:14):**  especially in our systems and our buildings to make sure that we're not at risk of weather  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:19):**  damage as well and so you know these are sectors that need to be considered these are things  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:24):**  that you can't really change or manipulate too much and kind of need to be accommodated  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:29):**  within the design and so the aspect of keeping this place secure as far as you know personal  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:35):**  belongings and safety but also against the heavy heavy rains that can come through here  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:41):**  and are inevitable later in the season as we get back into the rainy season.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:46):**  Yeah it's been a weird rainy season canicula translates when I looked it up to dog days  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:50):**  it's like the hottest time of the year when it should be the middle of rainy season but  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:55):**  it's like it's hot and dry and there's a wind coming through that's drying everything it's  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:09:59):**  beautiful the tourists are loving it everyone you know a lot of the tourists and backpackers  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:05):**  and me they're like I can't believe I'm getting so lucky with the weather but you know the  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:09):**  locals are not loving it the corn crop the tradition here is corn is a rain-fed crop  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:14):**  here for most people so they planted it the start the start of May when the rains come  
**[0:10:18-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:18):**  and you know you can see a lot of corn fields are suffering and it's you know it's following  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:26):**  a general trend that weather here is getting much more irregular it's hard to say exactly  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:33):**  what the trend is but this is this is my fifth rainy season in Guatemala and it's the second  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:39):**  or third it's the it's the second very dry dry season I've seen and we've also seen one  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:45):**  extremely wet one so it's kind of hard to like pinpoint that exactly what I have a feeling  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:51):**  is going to happen this year is you're going to get more dry weather more wind and just  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:10:56):**  drying conditions in general and then possibly all the rain coming in a very short space  
**[0:11:00-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:00):**  of time which we know is very dangerous yeah so I mean as these different factors are coming  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:09):**  up and need to be addressed we're trying to get out of sort of a reactionary way of amending  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:15):**  our designs but to a certain degree this sort of observation and interaction with these  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:21):**  things that are happening is essential for making sure that the you know the enterprises  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:26):**  that we're putting in the designs that we're making take into account the way that things  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:31):**  are changing as well yeah and there's really only so much you can do I mean we we live  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:36):**  down at this in a in a valley here and right up above us on it's pretty hard to imagine  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:43):**  if you haven't been to Lake Atitlan but about a thousand meters above us in elevation they're  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:50):**  building a road a main road that's going to come right down into this town there's five  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:11:56):**  waterfalls in this valley they're excavating on a slope that's about 80 degrees at some  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:02):**  point I have no idea I was up there looking at it yesterday I have no idea how they're  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:07):**  going to get this thing done it's like a big push el desero yo like which means development  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:14):**  is like a big political slogan here and a lot of mayors want to be the ones who got  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:20):**  the who got the road the the road that they've been talking about doing for years through  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:26):**  their land to hook up this because there is no real road access to Sununai you really  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:31):**  have to come here by boat or come around a very long alternative route so you know a  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:37):**  lot of people have been talking about and promising that this road is going to bring  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:41):**  progress and development but you know as ever at what cost and it's a it's a divisive issue  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:49):**  it and it you know honestly it scares me because this is the type of thing where with all these  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:12:56):**  waterfalls a plug of mud or huge boulders can just slide down they already have been  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:04):**  but what you know my real worry is that the one of the waterfalls or one or the main river  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:09):**  gets gets blocked and changes its course you know and that would have just drastic consequences  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:14):**  for us and everybody else down here so you know there really is only so much you can  
**[0:13:18-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:18):**  plan for yeah an interesting observation and that is when you come in from the lake you  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:26):**  can see the town layout fairly well and the majority especially of the indigenous population  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:31):**  is up on one of the ridges outside of the valley which is at much higher risk of what  
**[0:13:37-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:37):**  they call this lavas or mudslides and like neil said the change in the pattern or the  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:45):**  route of some of the waterways around here could have major ecological effects downstream  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:51):**  and you know we've worked on projects for clients and for friends down here in the valley  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:13:56):**  which you know could be severely affected by that especially if this increase in sort  
**[0:14:03-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:03):**  of severity of weather patterns and changing of climactic trends continues along so you  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:11):**  know these are these are all sorts of factors and sectors that need to be considered as  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:16):**  they come up and you know as visitors who have not been established here for really  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:21):**  long we don't have much of a say in how these things develop because there are two sides  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:27):**  to it certainly a lot of economic benefit and access to other markets can be brought  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:33):**  through the development and through the building of this new road but in a lot of cases it  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:41):**  seems like it may have been poorly planned and certainly a lot of ecological impacts  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:47):**  might not have been considered and they're already starting to take effect and it's unfortunately  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:53):**  just up the hill from us as well.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:14:56):**  Yeah I mean it's certainly been poorly planned and it's like always with these things these  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:02):**  things are they're double-edged swords you know I can understand that kind of argument  
**[0:15:06-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:06):**  for some from both sides but you know the funny thing is this is a lot of the the people  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:16):**  that you talk to people tend to come down very very hard on one side or the other a  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:21):**  lot of local people that you talk to are really in favor of the road because they think it  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:26):**  will bring jobs they think it will bring easier access to them for markets all those kinds  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:33):**  of things that that they struggle with you know having to like take their crops and walk  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:39):**  and get all get all the way down to a boat and drag it and get it over to the next town  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:43):**  you know now they're talking about maybe having just being able to get into a pickup and getting  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:47):**  up to a major town where there's a big market they know it will bring more tourism more  
**[0:15:54-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:15:54):**  just more more opportunities you know and we can't which is true and we can't lie and  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:02):**  say that we wouldn't benefit from those but ecologically I'm it really really concerns  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:07):**  me.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:08):**  Well so on that note let's shift gears a little bit and talk about some of the micro enterprises  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:12):**  that we've been working to implement and starting maybe the beginning stages of here on the  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:18):**  farm we've got a couple already established and I know that you have been working especially  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:24):**  hard on getting those systems to a manageable point where most of the maintenance can be  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:29):**  handed over to the people who are already working with us in order to help to justify  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:34):**  salaries and meet maintenance costs on the systems that we already have so I know that  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:40):**  we're weaning the baby goats right now and we're kind of tightening up our operations  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:46):**  in accessing markets for the dairy products and stuff can you talk about how some of that  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:51):**  journey has been over the last month?  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:16:54):**  Yeah look it's you know I'm definitely my my specialty is on producing food I'm still  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:00):**  learning about the other side of it which is just so important I've come to realize  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:06):**  over the years because you know there's Joel Salatin's book my successful farm business  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:13):**  was a big inspiration to me my friendship with with Shad in Atticland Organics was another  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:18):**  one and it's you know it's Joel Salatin talks about it's this idea that like just because  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:23):**  you're doing permaculture and you're treating the land well that you're somehow owed a living  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:30):**  you know and it's it's just it's not true or that if you grow great organic food people  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:35):**  will come and buy it off you you know also not true and it very important for us to have  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:43):**  a farm that stands on its own two feet to have a farm that even though it's on a small  
**[0:17:46-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:46):**  piece of land the model we're promoting is is sort of an intensive management system  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:17:55):**  on a small piece of land so that we can get a lot of our own food but also have a have  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:00):**  a profitable business to generate surplus to go back into it you know and I think anyone  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:05):**  who's done this type of thing it won't come as a surprise to them but it's all about dialing  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:10):**  it in you know it's like it's great you get it's great you get goats and you're like wow  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:15):**  we have all this amazing milk and you know now what do we do with it so you know it's  
**[0:18:20-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:20):**  like I would always say investing in inefficiency is was a big thing so we're still working  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:29):**  on it but getting a system where we know every morning okay Monday Wednesday Friday is yogurt  
**[0:18:35-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:35):**  Tuesday Thursday Saturday is cheese you know and milk gets bottled and filtered in this  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:48):**  station and and then you know doing luckily my my partner Adriana is is gifted with with  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:18:55):**  graphic design so she did a great job making up labels and posters so we got a lot of our  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:01):**  products into health food stores and restaurants and you know it was like a new time for me  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:06):**  putting on a different hat pounding pavements talking to people and saying look try our  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:10):**  amazing goats cheese try our delicious probiotic yogurt and yeah once you once you present  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:16):**  it to people and then make it easy for them to access your product and distinguish it  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:21):**  for other products and have a little bit of a story around it and have a consistency in  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:27):**  production you know those are the things you need and it actually does require to an extent  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:32):**  eliminating some diversity Jeremy got upset with me you guys will hear Jeremy on this  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:37):**  pretty soon he had to go back to the states for a couple of months but you know he started  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:41):**  a great little system making mushrooms and it was working nicely in a little hoop hose  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:47):**  with inoculated straw you know and he I was talking to him on the phone he was like yo  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:52):**  dog how are my mushrooms it's like man I haven't even I haven't even looked at him actually  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:19:57):**  no that's not true I composted the straw because I just even though he was like but it was  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:02):**  like I set it up really good so it was only you know like two hours a week and I was like  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:06):**  it's not you know what I basically said to him was it's not set up until those mushrooms  
**[0:20:10-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:10):**  are in a vacuum packed container and there's like four or five regular orders from stores  
**[0:20:18-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:18):**  or restaurants and the system is is very replicable and very clearly structured and ordered and  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:28):**  I really feel like those are the points that a lot of permaculture initiatives fail on  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:35):**  and it's you know it's one of the things that we we're learning and getting better at ourselves  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:40):**  and that we want to help our clients with because it's certainly not undoable it people  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:47):**  there is a great demand for these for these artisanal you know high quality food products  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:20:56):**  but it's a case of going that extra mile and dialing in picking the things that you want  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:02):**  to you want to work and and and dialing them in and then once they're working you know  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:07):**  the goats are working now so we built an adjacent chicken house I think I've talked about this  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:12):**  before that's fantastic you know no because no we have an in and bolts bolt things are  
**[0:21:18-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:18):**  alongside the garden so no we have we're creating we're creating relationships around our what's  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:26):**  been our central production right now which is the goats but you know the chicken house  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:31):**  is built they share a they share a wall the chicken house and the goat house so the chickens  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:35):**  are able to to go into the goat house but not the other way around they spend a lot  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:40):**  of time in there scratching around and eating bugs and just improving the health of the  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:46):**  goats but also getting a ton of protein themselves and what I'm really amazed by is because their  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:52):**  own house is a deep bedding system nothing nothing new there but just the amount of food  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:21:57):**  that they that they get from it and they really they really seem to benefit from having the  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:01):**  manure from the goat house going on top of there with fresh straw with all the food scraps  
**[0:22:07-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:07):**  that we collect and so and then of course the we've started to I think I finally found  
**[0:22:16-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:16):**  the right recipe for their feed which is we I started to buy cracked corn and fermented  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:23):**  in a little bit of microorganisms away from the cheese and and water and a little bit  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:29):**  of a calcium supplement so that is is amazing because the you know for anyone who's got  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:36):**  chickens I think the big disheartening thing about chickens is is how much grain you have  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:40):**  to feed them and and not knowing where it comes from you know here we can get cheap  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:47):**  locally grown corn that's been cracked and then you know it's not expensive but then  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:53):**  when we when we ferment it in those products it it doubles in size it sucks up all that  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:22:58):**  water and whey protein and and calcium and the microorganisms seem to really help it  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:05):**  to break down the cell walls and so it literally goes if nothing else it goes twice as far  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:12):**  but it's also charged with so much more extra nutrients so you know it's like I say it's  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:18):**  about the goats the goats are working so then setting up the tangential systems which will  
**[0:23:23-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:23):**  hopefully also know the free range concentrate free eggs will start to become a product and  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:32):**  again but that will be about going all the way and getting getting the container with  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:37):**  the eggs and the label and the loyal customer base and you know all those kinds of things  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:41):**  so look I think a little bit of the thing in this the message for me is you have to  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:45):**  be willing to wear different hats you know you have to be a farmer sometimes a businessman  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:50):**  a storyteller if you want to kind of have like an artisanal farm that's actually successful  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:23:55):**  in the business and you know we'll finish by saying we are definitely not experts in  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:00):**  this we're making this up as we as we go along but luckily so far so good.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:08):**  And you know we're talking about our specific examples but the overall idea is to minimize  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:16):**  the inputs especially imported inputs into our systems and to try and cycle back as many  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:22):**  of the byproducts from any given enterprise back into the feed systems for any other so  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:29):**  I mean the obvious example that Neil just gave was supplementing the feed for the chickens  
**[0:24:35-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:35):**  by putting in the manure and the other organic material from the animals up above in the  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:43):**  system in this case the goats there is you know other planned stages in this system to  
**[0:24:50-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:50):**  integrate rabbits and possibly ducks later along the line each time trying to use any  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:24:58):**  byproducts from the system so like he was saying the way from the cheese production  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:03):**  can go as a nutritional supplement for the cracked corn and the feed for the chickens.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:10):**  Right now we're actually collecting some of the compost or food scraps a kitchen scraps  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:16):**  from our neighbors here at the ashram but they're in their low season and that nutrient  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:22):**  source that we were depending on for a while to feed the chickens needs to be sort of augmented  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:27):**  with something else until they start producing again and so talk a little bit about some  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:32):**  of the other options that we've looked into to supplement the chicken feed when that resource  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:38):**  sort of dried up.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:40):**  Yeah well I mean it was like I'm a lazy gardener I don't like to weed especially if there's  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:47):**  no reason to do it so when we planted our corn this year we had collected so many seeds  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:25:53):**  from really nice cooking greens like kale and arugula and a few other things and we  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:00):**  just broadcast them everywhere throughout the garden we planted our corn and our squash  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:06):**  and our beans and all the other things but just planted them knowing that they would  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:09):**  you know grow up and fill the spaces and protect the soil basically use them as a cover crop  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:14):**  which is great we eat a big huge bowl of cooked greens every morning with our breakfast and  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:20):**  lunch but it's only so much of them you can eat and now they're kind of going to seed  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:25):**  getting gnarly and there's other weeds in there as well we haven't really done any weeding  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:29):**  for a couple of you know a couple of weeks but you know now we've decided okay we don't  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:34):**  have this food source way this food waste source anymore nearby so we're going to start  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:39):**  weeding the garden and we're going to actually it's a good time to do it because there's  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:43):**  heavier rains coming and the corn probably could do it a little bit of being on its own  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:50):**  so we're you know we're going through the garden section by section every day and just  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:53):**  pulling weeds and throwing that into the garden and mixing it with that fermented cracker  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:26:59):**  corn you know and that works i think the final thing i'll say about all these different initiatives  
**[0:27:04-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:27:04):**  you know maybe goats maybe rabbits maybe fertility you know quail eggs tomatoes and fermented  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:27:16):**  hot sauce you can there's it's true what bill mollison says you know the the the the limits  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:27:22):**  of the yield are the limiting factor in the yield is it is the designer's imagination  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:27:29):**  but also the designer's kind of time and energy input so for me every every initiative that  
**[0:27:36-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:27:36):**  you start unless it's expressly a hobby you know like a little like a food forest or you  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:27:45):**  know or a personal zone one garden every initiative on the farm should stand on its own two feet  
**[0:27:51-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:27:51):**  two feet so it's like right now the goats are you know an outstanding example of that  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:27:59):**  you know if we go and start doing for the high season kales and cooked greens if we  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:06):**  start doing eggs each of those things should stand on its own it should be like okay this  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:11):**  takes you know to manage the chickens takes two hours of labor per day it generates this  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:18):**  much income therefore it can clearly pay for the labor and give a rent back to the place  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:24):**  in the form of in this case it would be compost uh you know so that's kind of and then once  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:31):**  you do it that way you can be like okay all of these things are working now maybe we can  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:35):**  introduce ducks because we've got these ponds and we can put another small house over here  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:39):**  but once again the ducks don't the ducks don't piggyback on the goats and chicken success  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:45):**  they have to have their own little thing and like i say each one just has to be dialed  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:51):**  in and that's why you have to do them one at a time ultimately fortunately we've been  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:28:56):**  able to move forward a bit faster than just one at a time but it's because we're a team  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:01):**  and we can kind of split our time on our efforts um honestly most of my efforts over the last  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:06):**  handful of months have all been taken up by building the house and improving the infrastructure  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:11):**  on the place all the hardscaping and such as well as keeping an eye on the online portion  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:17):**  of the business and developing things like courses and moving forward with kind of the  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:22):**  design and consultancy side of things but like neil mentioned these micro enterprises  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:28):**  need to stand on their own they should be integrated of course especially in a diverse  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:33):**  sort of polyculture ecosystem like we have designed here and we continue to design as  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:38):**  new factors and resources become available but if they are basically being subsidized  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:44):**  by another enterprise on the farm or within the the larger business as a whole it either  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:51):**  needs to be treated accordingly as a hobby and there needs to be another way to to sort  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:29:57):**  of justify its existence within the rest of the systems or it needs to be treated as an  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:03):**  enterprise of its own that needs to stand on its own two legs and now that we have some  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:09):**  of the primary kind of base level enterprises within the farm reaching maturity or at least  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:15):**  a point where they justify all of their efforts and their consumption of resources now we  
**[0:30:21-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:21):**  can start to look at sub enterprises that sort of work in tandem around the base ones  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:29):**  in this case ours is the goats there's the opportunity to bring in other species that  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:34):**  can be integrated sort of symbiotically with the inputs and the byproducts that we're already  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:39):**  producing but one of the big things that I've been interested in for a while now is getting  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:45):**  to the point where you're solving problems not by adding more things or complexity to  
**[0:30:50-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:50):**  a system but by sort of niching down simplifying the processes and working towards efficiency  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:30:58):**  rather than just scaling things up this is something that Richard Perkins talks a lot  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:02):**  about in his YouTube channel and in his book I've Ridge Dale farm in Sweden he's been a  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:08):**  big inspiration for me and as far as once you get an enterprise sort of on its on its  
**[0:31:15-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:15):**  feet rather than simply trying to scale up and making the operation as big and profitable  
**[0:31:24-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:24):**  as possible it can often be much more efficient use of your time by eliminating complexity  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:32):**  and simplifying the system making it more efficient to the point where it's easier and  
**[0:31:37-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:37):**  more profitable to run on less inputs less energy for the same amount of output yeah  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:45):**  there's a there's a nice book called small is beautiful by a German economist called  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:50):**  a shoemaker I think it is but it's it's from back in the 70s it doesn't specifically talk  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:31:55):**  about farming but it's just this idea that yeah bigger is not necessarily more beautiful  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:00):**  and that you know I really do think that the future of of sort of permaculture and agroecological  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:07):**  farms is that artisanal market you know for every art for every artisanal product out  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:13):**  there there has to be an artisanal producer behind it you know from a business point of  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:17):**  view it's probably better if you if you can wear both of those hats but even if it's just  
**[0:32:22-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:22):**  producing the the nice heirloom grains to go into the surveys artists and other the  
**[0:32:29-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:29):**  artisanal beer you know and and and like Oliver says honing down and becoming more skilled  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:38):**  and more intensive on on the area you have rather than just looking to expand because  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:43):**  the more expand more you expand inevitably the more waste you're going to have within  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:47):**  your system yeah especially if it's not managed at the intensity that needs to in the beginning  
**[0:32:53-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:32:53):**  in order to get set up to a point of in of efficiency that it can be run somewhat autonomously  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:01):**  and one of our challenges is that you know we work primarily as designers consultants  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:06):**  and project managers for clients is is a main source of income for us here and while the  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:13):**  farm contributes to that on a half an acre in Guatemala there are some economic restrictions  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:19):**  like this is never going to really be able to bring in the same type of income as the  
**[0:33:24-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:24):**  other aspects of our job however we can create you know good living wage jobs for the people  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:32):**  who help us out here and maintain the systems while most of the time we may be working with  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:37):**  clients so there are different sort of criteria that we need to meet then we would perhaps  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:44):**  if we were doing this in another country or another region yeah maybe but the principles  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:48):**  are the same and you know I also like the fact that we're building towards having a  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:54):**  farm that even though it's on a small piece of land well firstly it's expanded but affected  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:33:59):**  there's so much kind of unused land around us where we can graze our goats but also that  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:04):**  yeah there is it is economically able to stand on its own two feet and maybe one day I'll  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:10):**  decide I want to garden and walk the goats for a living and I can just do that and earn  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:14):**  actually what would be a nice salary for for staying here and and being in the garden and  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:21):**  walking my goats all day you know which is actually why I got into permaculture but yeah  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:29):**  actually going back to going back to a thing you were asking you know I think a thing that  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:34):**  ties in a lot of different points we've been talking about you know security more fodder  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:38):**  for our goats more efficiency the big thing we're focusing on right now because we're  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:43):**  hoping that the rains are about to come back is putting in our living fence so there's  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:49):**  going to be a great podcast episode next week because I made contact with this fantastic  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:34:55):**  young woman Isa in vivamos mejor which is a an NGO that have an amazing collection of  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:03):**  native species for a range of different climates in Guatemala I think we've talked about this  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:08):**  before just how many there are right here at the lake there's four distinct ecosystems  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:13):**  and climates and you know their their nursery is amazing they have it divided they have  
**[0:35:17-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:17):**  all their plants divided up into into sections so we're gonna we're gonna plant out our living  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:24):**  fence with a mixture of soco which is a type of elderberry that's native to here what I  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:30):**  didn't realize until I went to meet Isa was that the name solo Lao which is this department  
**[0:35:35-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:35):**  actually in Cachacilda native language means land of soco it's a type of elderberry that  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:43):**  has great forage for goats and amazing fruit incredibly medicinal really fast growing and  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:48):**  drought resistant I think we're gonna make the majority of our living fence and it takes  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:53):**  by cutting will be that but we're gonna every two or three meters we're gonna put these  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:35:59):**  native legumes there's ones like watch it be lean and shoot but you know they have strange  
**[0:36:05-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:05):**  names Madrick a cow again also amazing father great would you know great building would  
**[0:36:15-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:15):**  and firewood leguminous so they they'll be great and also greatly wind blocks and I just  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:25):**  I'm so excited about it because they're also there are things that will be incorporating  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:30):**  into our our community reforestation project also as support plants to the heirloom avocados  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:37):**  that we plant on community people's land so you know just knowing that there's a resource  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:43):**  like that out there and a group of people who've been working for the last five or ten  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:47):**  years on this sort of like preservation of these extraordinary species you know you have  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:53):**  to come and see these things to believe them to some of these trees how beautiful they  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:36:58):**  are so that's going to be a big focus now getting the getting that living fencing in  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:03):**  a way that you know it's it's productive it's beautiful but it ultimately just makes our  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:09):**  life a lot easier.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:12):**  So that's the beauty of the edge space around here we do have to consider a lot of the efficiency  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:18):**  of our systems when it comes to the enterprises like the animals and the market garden but  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:23):**  the living fence and the borders around each of these areas is where we can really put  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:28):**  in the diversity and the support species and gilded species that support the rest of the  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:34):**  endeavors that we're trying to work on here.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:37):**  That's kind of always the the challenge and the paradox of trying to make this work as  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:42):**  a business is that oftentimes the diversity that you want to put in for a really healthy  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:48):**  ecosystem is at odds with the efficiency of the business portion that you're trying to  
**[0:37:52-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:37:52):**  run and so being able to find these sections of the land especially around the borders  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:00):**  and the fences that we're planting is where we can put in a lot more of the healthful  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:06):**  and diverse elements that attract wildlife and support species that are harder to integrate  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:13):**  into the efficiency of the business models.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:16):**  The abundant edge you might say.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:19):**  Oh you're excited to drop that one nice nicely done.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:23):**  I just couldn't wait.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:25):**  Look us up online.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:28):**  Well so let's switch gears one more time.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:31):**  I want to talk about one of the projects that I'm engaged with with a client just down the  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:35):**  hill from here and it's been a point of interest for a lot of people who have been following  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:39):**  the natural building side of this podcast.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:41):**  This is the first time that I get to work on what is commonly referred to as like a  
**[0:38:45-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:45):**  hobbit house or basically an earth integrated structure that is pushed into a call a Colina  
**[0:38:54-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:54):**  a hill space.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:55):**  I'm really struggling between the English and the Spanish because I use most of these  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:38:59):**  words in Spanish on a daily basis and sometimes it actually takes me longer to remember the  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:03):**  English word for things.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:05):**  But the challenge with structures like that is when you press a building into a hillside  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:12):**  you're cutting off a lot of your options for natural lighting and passive ventilation.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:20):**  And so these spaces if they're not designed correctly for those two aspects specifically  
**[0:39:25-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:25):**  they can start to feel damp and moldy and dark and dungeon like for lack of natural  
**[0:39:33-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:33):**  light and airflow.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:34):**  And so the biggest challenge for me on this design and build has been finding a way to  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:38):**  make sure that we can maximize the airflow and the natural light that comes through while  
**[0:39:44-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:44):**  still maintaining the aesthetic that the client wants in sort of this rustic but comfortable  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:53):**  earth integrated structure.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:39:55):**  Now I've been it's been necessary to use a lot more concrete than I'm normally comfortable  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:00):**  with mostly just because concrete has good water resistant properties.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:07):**  And the advantage of that being that if there is moisture or earth pressing up against it  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:12):**  from it from the backside where it's touching into the wall it's going to last and not degrade  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:18):**  the same way that say clay would as it starts to hydrate again and soften.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:24):**  So finding these barriers especially in the back there where it's touching into the earth  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:29):**  we've put in a large what's called a French drain and essentially it's a gravel pit that  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:35):**  runs the back end of the wall as if it were a retaining wall with a drainage tube at the  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:41):**  base so that if water does start to accumulate past a certain area it has a very easy and  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:47):**  quick path to drain out the side.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:50):**  So I'll be posting a lot more pictures of this as we move along and adding it to the  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:55):**  projects page on the Web site if people are interested in seeing how this is going.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:40:59):**  But I've been tentative to do that yet just because some of the troubleshooting hasn't  
**[0:41:03-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:03):**  been worked out yet and I'm still considering some other options for sort of moisture or  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:11):**  water barrier and waterproofing in that back wall and making sure that the drainage is  
**[0:41:17-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:17):**  adequate to make sure that there's no issues of mold or dampness coming in from a source  
**[0:41:24-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:24):**  that then can't be retrofitted later.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:27):**  If you have water problems from the beginning you're not going to be able to get back in  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:30):**  there and put in some sort of vapor barrier you're going to have to live with it.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:35):**  So we're exploring other options if anyone has suggestions or much experience working  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:40):**  with earth integrated homes or hobbit houses or any of the above especially in the context  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:44):**  of natural building.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:45):**  I would love to hear from you because this is the first time I'm trying it myself and  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:49):**  though I have some experience and some knowledge of different techniques and building materials  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:41:55):**  from the past I'm always happy to hear from the larger community to hear what's worked  
**[0:42:01-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:01):**  for you.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:02):**  If you've had any issues in the long term especially with moisture and you know I've  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:09):**  considered some of the designs from things like well fat is which Paul Wheaton has sort  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:13):**  of pioneered on the Permies and the rich soil platforms online.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:18):**  But you know there's a lot of other different context and design considerations within where  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:23):**  we are that have to be considered that change up the design.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:28):**  And so yeah so as we continue to do this prototype I'll be posting more pictures and I would  
**[0:42:35-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:35):**  love to hear from the community.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-7/#t=0:42:37):**  So that about does it for our check in for this month.

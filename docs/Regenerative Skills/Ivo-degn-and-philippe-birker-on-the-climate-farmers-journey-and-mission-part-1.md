**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:16):**  with Climate Farmers, an organization that is working to promote regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:21-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:21):**  in Europe.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:22):**  The truth, though, is that there's a much bigger story behind that collaboration, and  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:26):**  a whole lot more going on than just the panel discussions.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:29):**  Today, I want to begin to share the story and the journey that my colleagues and I have  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:34):**  been on for almost a year now.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:36):**  Until recently, I've been a bit apprehensive to talk too much about the work that I've  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:40):**  been collaborating on with the team at Climate Farmers, because it's still a very new project,  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:45):**  and it's taken a while for us to get clear about our direction, strategy, and path towards  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:50):**  our goals.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:52):**  All of those have become much clearer in the last handful of weeks, however, and it's time  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:01:56):**  to unveil this ambitious project and the remarkable people that have worked together to get it  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:01):**  off of the ground.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:03):**  So today is going to be the first in a two-part interview with Ivo Degen and Philip Berger,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:09):**  the co-founders of Climate Farmers.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:11):**  In this first part, we'll be talking about the concept of the organization, the current  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:15):**  state of modern agriculture in Europe, and the goals that we're working towards in order  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:19):**  to directly assist farmers in their transition to more profitable and ecologically viable  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:24):**  business management in a challenging and fast-changing industry.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:29):**  Next week in part two, we'll go back to the beginning and hear from both of them about  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:33):**  the wild ride that has brought us so far in such a short time, and all the brilliant people  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:38):**  that make up the team that is making it all work.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:41):**  So be sure to stay tuned next week for that as well.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:44):**  But before we get into the bigger concepts, let's start by getting to know Ivo and Philip,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:48):**  and the ideas that turned into this initiative.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:51):**  So Ivo, why don't you start out with your little introduction so we get to know who  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:55):**  you are.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:56):**  So what can I say about myself?  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:02:58):**  I've grown up in Western Germany on a small farm, really only a couple of hectares in  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:05):**  a very rural area.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:07):**  Though my family was never sort of never lived off of farming, it has definitely marked me  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:14):**  a lot to have grown up in this environment.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:16):**  And then I spent most of my professional career, basically all of my professional career in  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:21):**  the social impact sector.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:22):**  So basically working with what is called social entrepreneurship, and that is how can we build  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:29):**  businesses which at the same time solve a social problem.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:33):**  So a classic example of this is microcredits in southeastern Asia, which is not what I  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:40):**  worked with.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:41):**  I've worked mostly within building ecosystems for social change in Spain, in Chile, and  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:49):**  in Berlin.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:51):**  And a couple of years ago, I was in Berlin and working on a really exciting project called  
**[0:03:59-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:03:59):**  Project Together, which basically brought in a whole new idea of how as a society we  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:08):**  can work with social challenges.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:10):**  And while this is, continues to be extremely exciting, for me personally, I found that  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:17):**  I need to return to agriculture, like to return to really being closer to nature, closer to  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:24):**  soil.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:26):**  And I was researching a lot about regenerative agriculture, about agriculture, what is the  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:32):**  potential, how could like this huge sector that has such a big influence on Europe, you  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:39):**  know, be changed because there's so many interests in there, there's so many political interests,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:45):**  and private company interests, and what is potential to change something there.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:51):**  More or less the time that Oliver, you and me actually got talking and I interviewed  
**[0:04:57-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:04:57):**  Oliver on what he thought would be potential to change the system, what regenerative agriculture  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:05):**  needed in order to scale really what are some of the barriers.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:10):**  He actually gave me some very fundamental input there back then, I remember that.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:16):**  And what we have found over time is that regenerative agriculture is coming, you know, there's incredible  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:25):**  interest in it.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:26):**  And what it really needs is not for us to push it anywhere, but really to create the  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:31):**  infrastructure for it to scale.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:32):**  But this is already getting into the details of what we do.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:35):**  So I'll wrap it up there.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:37):**  Nice, don't worry, we'll get to all that good stuff.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:40):**  But Philip, why don't you tell us a little about yourself and how you got started here?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:43):**  Sure.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:44):**  Well, funny enough, actually, Beniou has a bit of a similar story growing up.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:49):**  So for me, it's also the countryside, it's also Western Germany.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:52):**  In this case, it's not my parents, but my godmother, who was the second closest person  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:05:56):**  to me in my life who comes from a farm, and is a farmer and sixth generation.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:00):**  So I basically grew up also very much on the countryside and with the hands in the dirt.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:05):**  And then I also went for the impact sector and for the startup sector.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:08):**  And well, if you work in the startup sector, the cities to be is Berlin and Amsterdam for  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:12):**  me.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:13):**  So I spent about eight years there working for different tech startups, most notably  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:17):**  Fairphone.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:18):**  And I loved my work, I loved the companies, but I did always have the feeling that the  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:23):**  calling is kind of calling me back to nature.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:25):**  And for me, it was always the thing is how do I combine the beautiful people that I find  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:30):**  in Berlin and Amsterdam and how do I combine my drive to have an impact on this world with  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:36):**  the fact that I actually want to be in nature and I want to be surrounded by trees.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:39):**  And the solution to that is the solution where a lot of young people come nowadays, it's  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:43):**  Portugal, because Portugal happens to be a country which has a lot of beautiful nature.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:49):**  And for some weird reason, people are not really interested in being there.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:53):**  So you have a lot of empty places.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:54):**  And me and some friends, we basically bought an old abandoned village up in the Portuguese  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:06:58):**  mountains, always sounds a bit more crazy than it actually is, because an old abandoned  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:02):**  village in Portugal had about 40 inhabitants at its height.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:05):**  And this is kind of what we're trying to recreate and basically buying that village five years  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:09):**  ago while still working in Amsterdam, fixing it up slowly.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:13):**  That's also what got me into basically thinking more about agriculture, permaculture, Richard  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:18):**  Perkins, and then sitting with Ivo having a beer in Maurer Park in Berlin while it being  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:24):**  43 degrees and thinking, if we don't fix this, whatever we're doing doesn't really matter.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:29):**  And then Ivo being like, did he hear about regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:32):**  And he'd be like, I heard about it, tell me more.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:35):**  And then us deciding to basically dive deep into that hole together.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:40):**  And yeah, that's kind of what got us sitting here.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:42):**  And luckily enough, it did, because it has been an amazing ride so far.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:46):**  It has, it's been a short but a really intense ride so far.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:49):**  Things have happened really quickly.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:51):**  And I'm wondering, first of all, how you identified the challenges of modern European farming  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:56):**  specifically, because both of you have traveled a whole lot.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:07:59):**  And you've seen agricultural traditions and practices in different places.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:03):**  But coming back home, the issues with farming here on this continent and figuring out what  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:10):**  climate farmers could do and the niche that it could occupy in that industry.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:15):**  I think what we have in Europe and one of the reasons why we're climate farmers, we  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:20):**  focus on Europe is because it is connected through the European Union and its system  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:27):**  of subsidies.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:29):**  So the system like agriculture anywhere in the world, not anywhere in the world, anywhere  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:34):**  in the Western world, I guess, is heavily subsidized.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:38):**  And obviously that changes a lot about what is possible and what the challenges are in  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:44):**  any specific place.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:46):**  So in Europe, though, it's extremely diverse, right?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:50):**  Like we have the very arid climates in the very south.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:53):**  We have Scandinavia.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:55):**  We have everything in between.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:08:59):**  And so while agriculture in Europe is very diverse, it is connected through that common  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:05):**  framework.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:08):**  What we have looked at it from two different perspectives.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:11):**  So obviously, on the one hand, really from the farmer's perspective, and we have talked  
**[0:09:15-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:15):**  with many, many farmers, both sort of from the more regenerative side, whether like coming  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:24):**  from the smaller scale permaculture or larger scale trying to apply some of the learnings  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:31):**  that come from the US and Australia.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:35):**  But then also having a lot of conversations with really traditional conventional farmers  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:41):**  to learn what is the average farmer struggling with?  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:46):**  What are challenges that are there?  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:48):**  What are things that farmers want to do?  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:52):**  What is keep holding them back?  
**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:09:54):**  And an interesting learning is, I think, at least for me that there's sort of very little  
**[0:10:02-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:02):**  in the way of very little that holds farmers, conventional farmers back from applying regenerative  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:09):**  agriculture.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:10):**  They want to do it.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:12):**  They also, many of them, at least today, after a couple of years of this growing a lot in  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:18):**  public perception, have a good understanding of their soils and why it is important and  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:24):**  why they should grow their soil health.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:29):**  What holds them back is not that they don't know about it or that they don't care about  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:33):**  it.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:34):**  Quite on the contrary, it's really making it financially viable.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:39):**  And I think this is the interesting thing.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:42):**  So the question we get is, okay, all of this sounds great.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:46):**  I've read about it.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:47):**  I heard about it.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:48):**  I've read about it.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:49):**  I have heard about it.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:50):**  I've heard about it.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:51):**  I can talk to farmers about it.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:52):**  Sounds great.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:53):**  I would love to do this but my farm looks nothing like Gate Brown's farm, looks nothing  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:10:58):**  like this other person's farm that I've seen somewhere.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:02):**  And how do I do regenerative agriculture where I am specifically?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:06):**  And how do I do it practically in terms of agricultural practices?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:09):**  And how do I do it in terms of economy?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:12):**  How do I make money off of this?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:15):**  Will this cost me more?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:18):**  Can I make more money off of this?  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:20):**  Can I save money?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:21):**  How does this work?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:22):**  So basically what we find is the interest is definitely there  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:26):**  but sort of on the practical side,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:30):**  it's still very, very difficult to access the information.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:35):**  And then the other thing is that we still in some situations  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:40):**  have regulation that sort of blocks  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:44):**  the development of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:46):**  This is specifically in the case of agroforestry  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:49):**  and where many farmers risk losing their subsidies  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:52):**  if they put trees on fields.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:11:55):**  And this obviously is something that many farmers can't risk.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:00):**  And so there's a lot of work that  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:02):**  needs to be done still on the policy side  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:05):**  to not only on the one hand take the regulations away  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:11):**  that limit the expansion of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:14):**  and then build policies that actually incentivize  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:17):**  regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:19):**  Philip, do you want to expand on that a little bit  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:21):**  and talk about how this concept came up?  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:24):**  Because Ivo just identified a lot of the things that  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:26):**  are holding farmers back and kind of tying their hands  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:30):**  from making the transitions that they want to  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:31):**  and also from earning a good living through management  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:35):**  practices on the land.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:37):**  But you've been kind of instrumental in helping  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:41):**  to bring this together as a concept  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:42):**  and assemble the team that we now  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:44):**  have to move these things forward  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:46):**  with a focus on the livelihood and the well-being  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:51):**  of the farming communities themselves  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:52):**  rather than the way a lot of these other ag tech companies  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:56):**  look to, which is through the market supply chain  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:12:59):**  or through public opinion.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:01):**  Yeah, I think the really beautiful part  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:04):**  at the beginning of our journey was we were like, OK,  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:06):**  we're interested in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:08):**  Let's visit farmers.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:10):**  So for about the better part of a year,  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:11):**  that's pretty much what I did.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:14):**  I have the luxury of being able to transition between Germany  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:16):**  and Portugal by car.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:18):**  So I pretty much did that distance three times.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:20):**  And I just stopped at every regenerative farmer  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:22):**  along the way that I could find.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:23):**  And Ivo touched upon it already.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:25):**  There was, in the end, always three main issues  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:28):**  that kept on coming up for those farmers.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:30):**  And this was access to transition finance,  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:33):**  so basically to financing the first three years when  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:36):**  you're transitioning towards regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:38):**  and then also access to knowledge,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:40):**  which is still a big problem.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:42):**  So most farmers that are getting into it  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:44):**  are learning through YouTube.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:46):**  So they're watching actually hundreds of thousands  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:48):**  of hours of YouTube videos, most of the time having  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:51):**  to watch a 30-minute video in order to have  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:52):**  five minutes of good content.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:54):**  So I would say it's a rather inefficient way of learning.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:57):**  And then the third part, and I think  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:13:59):**  this is also a key thing still to point out,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:01):**  is appreciation in society.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:03):**  I think we got to a point, unfortunately,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:06):**  where the people that are actually feeding us  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:08):**  are not really the people that are getting the respect  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:10):**  for it that they deserve.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:11):**  And this is especially true for regenerative farmers.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:14):**  I think this counts for all farmers,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:16):**  but also especially regenerative farmers,  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:18):**  which are cleaning up our global and local ecosystem.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:21):**  And that's also what led us to have the name climate farmers,  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:24):**  and to start with the website as we started it, where we  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:27):**  basically tried to outline why we believe  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:29):**  that regenerative farmers are the heroes of our times,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:31):**  and where we basically share the stories of these heroes,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:34):**  so that hopefully other people get inspired and also get  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:37):**  to the situation.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:38):**  I don't want to be a banker.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:39):**  I don't want to be a lawyer.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:40):**  I want to be regenerative farmer,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:42):**  because that's what's actually really cool.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:45):**  Yeah, it's interesting that we've  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:47):**  started to flip that in a cultural sense.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:50):**  And one of the challenges that I've really  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:51):**  had getting involved with this company and this place  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:56):**  that I've moved to only two years ago  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:14:58):**  is realizing just how much cultural difference,  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:01):**  to say nothing about language barriers and traditions,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:04):**  and all the nuances that are packed  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:08):**  into a very small continent, relatively speaking.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:11):**  And the things that apply to or that  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:13):**  are motivating to the farming communities of Portugal  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:16):**  are sometimes different just here in Spain,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:18):**  or even in different communities around Spain.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:20):**  And I can't even speak much on many of the other countries  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:23):**  that I haven't spent a whole lot of time in that you guys know  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:25):**  a lot better than I do.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:27):**  And so I'm wondering, how are we working  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:29):**  to improve the situation for farmers themselves,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:33):**  given that there's so much diversity that needs  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:35):**  to be accounted for in that?  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:37):**  Yeah, I mean, I think it's just like I was recently  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:43):**  in a debate on the EU subsidy system.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:49):**  And my thought there was like, I really  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:53):**  would not want to switch places with any of the people  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:15:56):**  responsible for figuring out how to create a system that  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:01):**  works for every of the 10.5 million farmers across Europe.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:04):**  Like I really would not want to be there.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:10):**  What we see is that up until now,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:14):**  we have tried to sort of establish  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:18):**  a top-down, simplified system for a very complex situation.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:23):**  And I don't think I'm surprising anyone on this podcast  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:27):**  if I say that this is probably not going to work.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:29):**  Or I think we can see by now that it isn't working.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:33):**  So we have a complex system.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:38):**  And it just does not work to sit in Brussels,  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:43):**  in one place in Europe, and say this  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:46):**  is how agriculture should work in any of these places,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:49):**  in any of the microclimates, in any of the valleys,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:51):**  in any of the hills in this relatively small continent,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:16:57):**  but still on this whole continent.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:00):**  And so there's a bit of a crisis right now  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:06):**  in terms of how do we continue with agriculture in Europe,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:11):**  because we know that it causes a large part of our emissions.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:17):**  It's much smaller than the percentage worldwide.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:19):**  In Europe, it's only between 10% and 13%.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:23):**  Worldwide, it's about 24% to 33%.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:26):**  So it's comparatively small, but we haven't been  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:28):**  able to lower it in 10 years.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:30):**  And at the same time, we have all sorts  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:32):**  of issues with externalized costs  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:35):**  from agriculture, where we're damaging ecosystems  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:38):**  by the way we produce food.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:40):**  And we're basically lowering the resilience of our farms,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:43):**  so endangering the future of our food production.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:48):**  And it's clear that this needs to be changed.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:51):**  And it's incredibly heartening to see  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:54):**  that the European Commission, at least,  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:58):**  is very, very clear on that.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:17:59):**  And they understand that they understand  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:01):**  the value of regenerative agriculture, something  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:03):**  that I would not have believed three years ago,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:07):**  that we would ever have conversations  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:09):**  with policymakers on that level and talk  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:13):**  about regenerative agriculture, like this stuff that was  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:17):**  so niche a couple of years ago.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:19):**  So this is incredibly exciting.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:21):**  While this is very, very complex and still in its early phases,  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:26):**  a position that we are supporting a lot  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:30):**  is to move agricultural subsidies and support  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:36):**  from a practice-based approach.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:39):**  So basically telling farmers, you  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:40):**  should be doing this or that.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:42):**  And if you do this, then we will pay you that much,  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:47):**  to a result-based system.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:51):**  So where we don't tell farmers, do this or that,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:54):**  but we tell them that the objective is this.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:18:59):**  And if you do this, then we as a society can pay you extra.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:03):**  So if farmers maintain healthy drinking water,  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:09):**  if they maintain biodiverse ecosystems,  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:12):**  if they capture carbon in their soils, all of these things  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:17):**  are values to our society that the farmer, per se,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:21):**  doesn't have so much, has an interest in.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:23):**  But the farmer has a direct interest  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:26):**  in producing crops and selling them to survive as a business.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:30):**  So if we as a society want farmers to do this,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:35):**  then we need to incentivize this.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:36):**  And we can only incentivize this if we actually  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:39):**  pay for the results at the end.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:41):**  So I don't know what a farmer in southeastern Spain needs to do  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:46):**  and what a farmer in northwestern Poland needs to do.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:51):**  I can't tell them.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:53):**  Because it might be that in their specific valley,  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:19:56):**  it's in Spain, it's not arid.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:00):**  It might be that in this specific area,  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:02):**  it's actually quite humid.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:04):**  So we can't have rules like that.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:06):**  So basically, if we tell them, this  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:08):**  is what we want to achieve.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:09):**  We want to achieve ecosystem health,  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:12):**  we want to achieve soil health, we  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:14):**  want to achieve healthy drinking water and other parameters,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:17):**  and we make them measurable, farmers can actually  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:19):**  find their own ways to do this.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:21):**  And it's very clear that farmers know  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:23):**  that the ecosystem's the best.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:25):**  They know the best what context they're in.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:27):**  They know the best what to do.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:29):**  And I've hardly ever heard people swear so angrily  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:35):**  as farmers about European regulations,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:38):**  about what they're supposed to do  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:39):**  and what they're not supposed to do.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:41):**  Because what is this idea of policymakers telling farmers  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:45):**  what to do in their specific context?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:47):**  It's crazy.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:48):**  So farmers know best what to do.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:50):**  We basically need to tell them, well,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:52):**  if you optimize for these things,  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:55):**  then we as a society can pay you for that.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:20:58):**  And then it's up for the farmers whether or not  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:01):**  they want to optimize for these things.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:03):**  So that's a really good overview about some  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:05):**  of the structural changes that need  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:07):**  to happen to regain the autonomy and empower people  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:11):**  to make the correct decisions for their land  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:14):**  in order to achieve some of the goals  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:15):**  that we've set for our society and for our ecosystems.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:18):**  And now, Philipp, can you talk about some of the resources  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:21):**  that we're providing or building as climate farmers  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:24):**  as an organization to help make that easier or possible?  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:29):**  I mean, as I mentioned before, we  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:30):**  have three main angles where we're  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:31):**  tackling the whole problem.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:33):**  So the first angle is basically appreciation in society  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:36):**  where I have to say Kiss the Ground did definitely  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:39):**  a really good job already.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:40):**  Like that definitely changed a lot of the perspective  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:43):**  and they did a good job in storytelling.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:45):**  We are putting this more on the European perspective  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:47):**  with our website where we basically  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:48):**  create the profiles of the farmers.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:50):**  And the second part is the Climate Farmers Academy  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:54):**  where you're also very involved in  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:56):**  and where we are basically compiling all the knowledge  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:21:59):**  that we can find online and we're structuring it.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:02):**  So what we are seeing is basically if you go on YouTube,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:05):**  there's not a good way to find exactly what we need.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:07):**  So we have an open source database  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:09):**  where we have written articles, where we have videos,  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:11):**  where we have podcasts, and we can really easily go through.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:15):**  And you can take a look at what do I  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:16):**  need to get information on.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:17):**  And then you can get to that point  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:19):**  and you can find hopefully the information that you need.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:21):**  And we also have people that are passionate about a certain topic  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:24):**  that are creation content there for us.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:26):**  Next to that, we are really focusing  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:28):**  on connecting the farmers in Europe with each other.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:31):**  So one thing that we observed was  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:33):**  that there was a lot of problems that appeared  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:35):**  in different places in Europe and farmers that  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:38):**  made the same mistakes simply because they did not  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:40):**  know that this was a problem and that they should not  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:43):**  be doing this.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:44):**  A very nice example that I always  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:46):**  have is with a farmer in southern Portugal  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:49):**  in Alentejo who was applying holistic management principles.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:53):**  And while he has animals, he also has cork trees.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:22:57):**  And he knew that the cork trees need  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:00):**  to be at a certain size in order to be  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:02):**  able to resist the cows, right?  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:03):**  So his line of thinking was once the trees are big enough  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:07):**  or as big as the cows, I'm fine.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:09):**  And I can let the cows go on there and graze it because I  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:11):**  cannot stomp on them.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:13):**  Fair point so far.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:14):**  Problem was the cows really loved rubbing their backs  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:18):**  on those trees.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:19):**  So what happened was they broke down all the trees  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:22):**  and you had to start all over again.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:24):**  Now he knows the trees need to be eight years old before he  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:27):**  can let the cows go on there.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:28):**  This is a mistake that could easily  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:30):**  be avoided if he would have had the opportunity  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:32):**  to talk with another farmer that is applying a similar principle  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:35):**  and then could have told him this information.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:37):**  And that's what we're trying to create with our climate farmers  
**[0:23:40-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:40):**  community.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:40):**  We have right now around 350 farmers  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:43):**  from all over Europe in there.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:44):**  And we're doing this, we're doing biweekly skill calls.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:47):**  So we're inviting a certain expert  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:48):**  on the topic like, for example, Richard Perkins.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:51):**  And then the expert is speaking for one hour on the topic  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:53):**  and afterwards the farmers can exchange best practices  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:56):**  with each other.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:57):**  And they can basically tell each other about the experience  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:23:59):**  that they have been having.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:01):**  Next to that, we also have the problem of basically payment  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:05):**  for ecosystem services, which farmers are providing,  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:08):**  and of having a transition finance for farmers  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:11):**  that want to transition from conventional agriculture  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:14):**  to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:15):**  And this is a very exciting program  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:17):**  that we have running at the moment together with Richard,  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:20):**  which we basically created because we  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:21):**  saw that there was a need.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:22):**  So we had a lot of farmers that were approaching us  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:25):**  that as Ivo pointed out, basically said, hey,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:27):**  I want to become regenerative.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:28):**  But I don't really know how to.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:30):**  And Richard, in our experience, made a really nice regenerative  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:33):**  agriculture masterclass, which we  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:35):**  use as a basis for summer program, which  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:38):**  is about 10 hours of self-study per farmer.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:40):**  And then on top of that, we spice it up  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:42):**  with basically having expert input  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:44):**  and connecting the farmers again with each other  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:46):**  so they can learn together and they can grow together.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:49):**  And we're building up a consultant database  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:51):**  because it's very hard to find a fit to consultant,  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:53):**  where consultants are basically advising our farmers  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:56):**  on an individual level what they should be doing on our farm  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:24:59):**  and where afterwards we will also have this  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:01):**  on our website with testimonies by farmers about the work  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:04):**  of the consultants so that farmers all over Europe  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:07):**  can go online and they can find a consultant that is fitting  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:09):**  for their need.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:10):**  And these nine farmers can transition together,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:13):**  together with us and together with Richard  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:15):**  from conventional to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:17):**  And afterwards, the idea is to keep on running these batches  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:20):**  and to help as many farmers as possible to do this transition.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:23):**  Well, so that leads me to where I was trying to go to,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:26):**  which is like, this is kind of a popular thing all of a sudden.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:30):**  In the last couple of years, regenerative agriculture  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:32):**  has become a buzzword.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:33):**  It's been co-adopted by so many other organizations  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:36):**  and influencers and everybody.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:39):**  And as a result-  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:40):**  I love your podcast, whatever.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:42):**  I did it before it was cool.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:43):**  No, I'm just kidding.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:45):**  I was actually late to the game.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:48):**  But as a result, there's a huge influx of startup companies  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:53):**  and people trying to get into this space  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:55):**  because there's money being invested in it.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:25:57):**  And it's sometimes hard to distinguish  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:01):**  who's doing what and what part of the industry they serve.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:04):**  So what sets us apart from this sort of ag startup space  
**[0:26:08-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:08):**  right now?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:08):**  And where did we come up with that for the farmers tagline  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:13):**  that kind of defines where we're headed?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:16):**  Ivo?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:17):**  Yeah, there's a lot going on, which is, on the one hand,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:22):**  incredibly exciting.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:24):**  I think it was an interesting moment  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:28):**  because when Philipp and I started  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:30):**  talking about regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:33):**  well, it was still pretty much permaculture.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:37):**  Pretty much the only thing that was there was permaculture.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:39):**  And a couple of people that were wondering,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:43):**  could we do that bigger?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:46):**  And then there were people like Mark Sheppard  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:48):**  who had proven, yes, OK, it can be done bigger,  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:50):**  and a couple of other examples.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:53):**  And when we started looking into the potential  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:26:59):**  of this kind of agriculture, and there  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:06):**  were a couple of scientific papers about carbon capture  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:10):**  through agriculture.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:12):**  And I remember just happening over a sentence  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:15):**  that, OK, well, carbon capture through agriculture.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:18):**  I was like, wait, how much?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:19):**  And then started looking for papers.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:21):**  And then I found the work of Dr. Johnson in the CSU, Chico,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:26):**  and a couple of other studies.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:29):**  I was like, OK, wait.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:30):**  So if we scaled that, it would actually be huge.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:34):**  We could actually reverse climate change  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:36):**  in three to five years if we scaled that  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:39):**  to 100% of agricultural land.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:42):**  I was like, wait, what?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:44):**  And I was looking for this.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:45):**  I was like, if this potential is there,  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:47):**  why is nobody talking about this?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:48):**  And with research slowly found, OK,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:51):**  well, there is a bit here.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:52):**  There's somebody has mentioned it there.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:54):**  Drawdown has talked about it.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:27:56):**  But it really wasn't easy to find information about it.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:00):**  Within a couple of years, this has exploded.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:04):**  And by now, it's everywhere.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:05):**  I remember having conversations in the beginning  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:09):**  at Climate Farmers with a couple of people  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:12):**  that I met about what we were doing.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:14):**  They were like, this can't be.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:15):**  This potential that you're talking about is impossible.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:18):**  Everybody would be talking about it otherwise.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:20):**  And I talk with them now.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:21):**  And they're talking about like, obviously, everybody  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:25):**  knows about this.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:26):**  So this is incredibly exciting.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:30):**  On the other hand, I think there are two major risks that I see.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:35):**  On the one hand, everybody is talking about it.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:40):**  At least in Germany, every major outlet  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:46):**  that within the agricultural space has talked about it  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:51):**  in the last couple of years.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:28:54):**  And so farmers that are excited about are very likely to try it.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:00):**  And sometimes people in this space  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:04):**  have a tendency to overblow the potential  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:07):**  and make it seem like it's super easy.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:09):**  It's incredible if you just do this and that and that.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:12):**  And then within one year, you have perfect regeneration  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:15):**  of everything.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:17):**  And hundreds of tons of carbon captured  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:20):**  and climate change is solved.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:22):**  And this is not the way it works.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:24):**  Sorry to pop that bubble.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:27):**  And there's a huge risk of that happening to farmers,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:32):**  of farmers reading about it, trying it,  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:35):**  and being disappointed talking about it.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:38):**  And very quickly, this whole thing  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:39):**  of regenerative agriculture becomes sort of, yeah, OK,  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:43):**  it's this thing that Netflix did.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:45):**  But they are not farmers.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:46):**  They don't have a clue.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:47):**  So there's a risk of farmers becoming cynical about it.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:53):**  On the other hand, we have the industry picking up on this.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:29:57):**  Like we have, well, in the beginning,  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:00):**  we had Dr. Bronner's and Patagonia,  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:03):**  which I love their work.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:05):**  And then we had General Mills and also impressive work there.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:11):**  And then we have McDonald's and Nestle and Cargill and Bayer  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:18):**  picking up on that.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:19):**  I'm not 100% sure about that.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:23):**  And so what we see is this is everywhere.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:27):**  And everybody has picked up on this.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:29):**  And it is the new sustainable.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:32):**  It is the new buzzword.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:34):**  And there's a huge risk of this becoming meaningless  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:37):**  because we actually don't have a definition  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:40):**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:42):**  We have a set of principles that are very widely read  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:48):**  upon, six principles that, for example, Gabe Brown talks about  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:51):**  or different people in this space.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:54):**  And they give a good indication.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:56):**  But we don't actually know what regenerative agriculture is.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:30:59):**  So now somebody like Cargill, named  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:04):**  as the worst company in the world by an NGO watchdog,  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:09):**  can just go and say, we do regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:13):**  And we define it in this way.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:15):**  So it works for them.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:17):**  And so we have a big risk of this becoming greenwashing term  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:20):**  without any actual meaning.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:22):**  And so I alluded to this in the beginning.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:28):**  Originally, when Philip and I sat down a couple of years ago,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:32):**  we had this idea that we have to push regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:34):**  We have to convince people.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:36):**  We have to do campaigns to convince farmers to do this.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:39):**  It's very clear we don't have to do that now,  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:41):**  that other people have done that for us.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:43):**  But what we do need to do is we need  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:46):**  to create an infrastructure for regenerative agriculture  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:50):**  to actually exist on the long term  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:54):**  and not be just a buzzword that is replaced in the shortest  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:31:57):**  amount of time and for it to actually have the amazing  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:03):**  impact that it can have.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:04):**  Because, for example, another term  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:08):**  that is being used is carbon farming.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:10):**  And that reduces it to only carbon.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:13):**  And very likely, a lot of funny things  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:16):**  are going to happen if we reduce it to only carbon.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:19):**  And so if we want to actually make sure  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:21):**  that we're talking about a kind of agriculture that regenerates  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:24):**  ecosystems, captures carbon, improves  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:26):**  the profitability of farms, improves the image of farmers,  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:30):**  we need to create a bit of infrastructure  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:32):**  to make that possible.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:34):**  And Philip and I sometimes joke, what better  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:36):**  than a group of Germans to create infrastructure?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:39):**  So that's what we do now.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:44):**  OK, let's take a break there because there's  
**[0:32:46-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:46):**  a lot more to this story.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:48):**  So far, we've covered the challenges  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:50):**  of modern farming and the niche that climate farmers are hoping  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:52):**  to occupy in the transition to a regenerative agriculture  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:56):**  future in Europe.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:57):**  But the road to get to where we are now,  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:32:59):**  even in this early stage, has been a lot less than smooth.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:33:03):**  In next week's episode, we'll conclude the interview  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:33:05):**  by going back to the beginning and taking  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:33:07):**  a look behind the scenes at how a young ag tech startup has  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:33:10):**  managed to stick together through a pandemic  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:33:13):**  and turn idealist visions of a healthier farming industry  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ivo-degn-and-philippe-birker-on-the-climate-farmers-journey-and-mission/#t=0:33:16):**  into real work on the ground.

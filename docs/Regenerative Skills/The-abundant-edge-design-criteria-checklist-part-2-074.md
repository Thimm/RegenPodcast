**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:25):**  Alright, hello everyone out there, welcome back to part two of the Abundant Edge Design  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:30):**  Criteria Checklist.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:32):**  If you're just tuning in now, I would really recommend that you go back to last week's  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:35):**  episode and listen to the first portion.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:38):**  Now just remember that the free PDF that accompanies these two episodes can be downloaded for free  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:43):**  at AbundantEdge.com in the show notes for this episode for the podcast.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:48):**  Now last week we went in deep about defining your vision and goals.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:52):**  We went through the visioning exercise and then covered the second portion about site  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:02:55):**  analysis and inventory of resources and limitations.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:00):**  Talking about site analysis and mapping, inventory of materials and now today we're going to  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:05):**  move on to invisible structures.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:07):**  As usual I'm joined by my friend and colleague Neil Haggerty.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:11):**  So let's jump right on in and start on with the second portion of our design criteria  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:15):**  checklist.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:17):**  Let's go now to another very important category that is often overlooked and can really gum  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:23):**  up the progress of your projects if it's forgotten.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:27):**  And of course I'm talking about invisible structures.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:30):**  Now invisible structures are the rules and regulations that govern what you can legally  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:34):**  do and how within a society.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:38):**  Different places have very different standards.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:40):**  So I won't go into any specifics for any given region.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:44):**  And there are a lot of places that even have a complete lack of rules and regulations or  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:49):**  at least that can be circumvented very easily.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:52):**  So it's really worth doing your research here to see what kinds of incentives and limitations  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:57):**  there are to your project plans.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:03:59):**  In many countries and regions around the world there are also subsidies and other forms of  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:03):**  support that governments and other organizations offer to incentivize ecosystem care.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:08):**  You might even be able to leverage these for financial gain if you meet those stipulations.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:13):**  So let's start at the beginning.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:14):**  I'm talking about codes, permits and regulations.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:17):**  So you want to start by doing a thorough research into what you are legally allowed to build  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:22):**  with and what you're allowed to build.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:26):**  What kind of waste and water treatment facilities are you legally required to have on your site.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:32):**  These can vary drastically depending on what kind of ecological features you're near.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:37):**  If you're in an environmentally protected zone there could be some very strict limitations.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:42):**  Also a lot of urban areas have very strict codes and regulations about what you're allowed  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:47):**  to do.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:48):**  Now how will new construction and infrastructure affect your property taxes.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:53):**  This is something that a lot of people don't think through.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:04:56):**  When you reassess when the taxman comes by to see what sort of resources on your land  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:01):**  and all of a sudden you're strapped with a yearly property tax bill that way out strips  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:05):**  what you had in your budget to continue to develop your site.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:09):**  This can be an extremely limiting factor and is worth doing research on as ahead of time  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:15):**  as possible.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:17):**  What kind of checks inspections and reviews are you required to have done on your site  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:21):**  and within what amount of time.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:24):**  All of this is worth researching.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:25):**  I have known people who have had their entire operations shut down because they did not  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:30):**  foresee some of the regulations that they needed to accommodate within their project  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:34):**  planning.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:35):**  Now let's look at some of the positive sides of this.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:39):**  I'm talking about subsidies.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:41):**  There are many places in the world that have financial incentives known as subsidies for  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:44):**  all kinds of environmental regeneration efforts.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:47):**  Reforesting land or planting certain crops are just one example.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:51):**  Do your research thoroughly and you might be able to make some extra money for things  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:05:55):**  that you were already planning on doing as long as you meet the criteria stipulated for  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:00):**  those subsidies.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:02):**  Now within budget you want to look at it through the lens of a timeline.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:06):**  So you may have certain amount of funds already some that are coming in later in time and  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:11):**  some that could be available in emergency situations.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:15):**  So let's look at those individually.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:17):**  What do you already have available what is liquid assets that you can use right now to  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:22):**  advance your projects.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:24):**  What are some funds that will become available in the future and when.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:29):**  What kind of funds can be made available if absolutely necessary how and when.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:35):**  Knowing how to get access to these things is just as important as knowing that they  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:39):**  exist because it does not help you if some of your resources are tied up and only accessible  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:45):**  on a longer time frame.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:48):**  What kind of funds can be acquired in your one five 10 and 20 year timelines.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:53):**  How can you make those available.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:06:56):**  And lastly is this project meant to be profitable or at least self-sustaining.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:01):**  What will be the primary sources of income and what are the overhead requirements to  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:05):**  make that income.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:07):**  Again this is really important to take a look at the overhead requirements to make that  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:12):**  income need to be considered before you start calculating what the income could be.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:17):**  A perfect example is here on our farm.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:21):**  We've got goats chickens and are planning on getting more animals which have the potential  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:25):**  to give us more of an income from the place.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:28):**  But until we have built proper pens to house them accounted for the overheads of feed costs  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:35):**  which you know you can mitigate through things like food scraps and waste products from other  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:41):**  aspects within your community.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:43):**  But if you don't consider those and just think of it as an income you're going to forget  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:47):**  the inputs that are required to make that a solvent enterprise.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:54):**  Now we've reached the design portion of this criteria list.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:07:58):**  We can finally get to the fun part with all of the information gathered from the previous  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:02):**  categories you should be well prepared to make a conscientious and insightful design.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:07):**  Remember to think through the timeline of the components that you're designing to mitigate  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:12):**  obsolescence and decay especially in the case of infrastructure and buildings.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:17):**  If those are not considered from the beginning you're going to have infrastructure that immediately  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:21):**  starts to fall apart and is going to need maintenance which comes with a lot of costs  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:26):**  and time commitment.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:29):**  Ideally your designs will improve and mature over time or at least be easy to maintain  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:33):**  and improve or renovate.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:35):**  So first you've got to define the components of your goals and your visions which we completed  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:40):**  earlier the first stage of this criteria which need to be designed and planned for.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:45):**  Things like building infrastructure landscape utilities and especially water and we'll get  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:50):**  into the details in those now.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:53):**  This should be like a fun time right so you should you know you've got some homework done  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:08:57):**  there's probably a group of you at this point sitting down to design your enterprise and  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:04):**  and so using you know some knowing some basic tools to stimulate your creativity and to  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:09):**  produce coherent designs is a really really good thing to do.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:14):**  You know things like random assembly niche analyses there's loads of there's loads of  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:19):**  stuff on these in the in the permaculture designers manual but you can also google them.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:26):**  You know really great exercises to do and kind of like having a good base map and just  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:34):**  deciding on elements you want and putting them in post-its you don't instead of like  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:38):**  getting all you know worried about how to draw the chicken coop just write chicken coop  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:45):**  on a post-it and then move it around the board you know and go like okay chicken coop could  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:50):**  go here garden could go here food forest could go here pond could go here you know but and  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:09:56):**  and start filling it up and start drawing arrows between different things and and just  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:03):**  it to to symbolize interactions you know and remember that you want lot essentially the  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:09):**  stability and the resilience of your structure depends on the number of beneficial interactions  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:15):**  that are there between elements.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:17):**  It's not necessarily about having a super diverse system so much as it is having one  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:23):**  with various elements all of which are interacting with each other so you know you want your  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:29):**  garden interacting with your animal house or your compost system or your worm compost  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:36):**  which is also like going back into you know your waste from your garden for example goes  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:41):**  into your chicken coop your food forest is also range for your your goats your living  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:48):**  fence it gives you privacy and and and privacy also gives you forage for your animals and  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:10:55):**  seasonal fruits you know this kind of idea right create making sure that there's lots  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:01):**  of positive interactions and you're thinking about energy flows you know you so things  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:05):**  that you want interacting with each other on a physical level you know probably should  
**[0:11:11-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:11):**  be located near to each other and then this is the reason that you start to look at the  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:20):**  multifunctionality of energy flows as well right so your your pathways and your fencing  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:27):**  and your water lines will kind of come in at this point as well I think you know so  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:32):**  those three should really go together in a sense and you know so you start to slowly  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:40):**  settle into the kind of nitty-gritty of the design now the list that we have here does  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:47):**  not need to be in a particular order but it is worth knowing that your buildings are likely  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:53):**  to eat up the majority of your budget when it comes to land development now assuming  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:11:58):**  that you want to live on the site and you're not living off-site somewhere else and already  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:02):**  have your housing taken care of you want to start with your zone zero mostly just because  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:08):**  so many of your energy flows are going to go through your buildings most of all of your  
**[0:12:13-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:13):**  utilities as well as the most frequent interactions from humans all happen in and around the immediate  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:21):**  surroundings of buildings or your zone zero now this is when you can refer back to some  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:27):**  of the data that you've gathered and especially start looking at your needs and your wants  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:32):**  lists how much of the resources on your site can be used in construction this is really  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:37):**  going to help you keep your budget under control if you can source most of your materials from  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:42):**  your site itself from there how much can be salvaged recycled borrowed or rented and what  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:49):**  are the buildings traditionally made from and designed to facilitate in your area now  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:54):**  I'm talking about going back in time and looking at the vernacular buildings what would you  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:12:59):**  need to update to suit your needs and wants from how buildings were traditionally made  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:04):**  in your area there are plenty of great references to see what the vernacular structures were  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:11):**  wherever you happen to be building most all sites around the world have a very rich building  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:18):**  history even if those buildings aren't still standing there might be a reason why they're  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:23):**  not still standing either they were purposely built as in as temporary structures or the  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:28):**  maintenance and replacement of key elements of those structures was planned into the construction  
**[0:13:34-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:34):**  from the initial site now from there consider infrastructure this can go very very deep  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:42):**  into detail so I've kept it just to two bullet points your primary access things like gates  
**[0:13:47-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:47):**  walls paths roads etc and your secondary access things like energy flows within the site for  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:13:55):**  efficiency and ease of use now this can be broken down on the macro or the micro scale  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:00):**  you can look at energy flows within within each individual building or component on your  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:05):**  site and you can look at it as a site wide energy flow analysis as well like Neil mentioned  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:11):**  just a second ago landscape features and gardens are extremely important now we're talking  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:17):**  about your zones one through five we could go into a lot more detail about this but it's  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:23):**  going to be extremely specific to your goals so this is where you want to review and revisit  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:29):**  the goals and visioning exercise from the beginning of this criteria list and now let's  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:36):**  talk a little bit about something that is very often overlooked in the design process  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:40):**  and that's maintenance this is a really important one the more maintenance your systems required  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:45):**  the more your time and your budget will be tied up preventing you from advancing other  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:50):**  projects yeah this is crucial and it's kind of like back to what we were saying at the  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:14:56):**  start of the thing of you know your enthusiasm will inevitably wane slightly once you you  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:04):**  know figure out that wow i can grow my own food and live off the grid so thinking about  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:10):**  maintenance systems and again just thinking about energy flows the biggest cost any system  
**[0:15:16-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:16):**  always has is is labor and human capital you know so just and if you know if you're a good  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:26):**  permaculture designer and if you're accepting feedback as you put your systems in place  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:31):**  this should kind of flow organically you will you know ideally and this is why these systems  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:38):**  are kind of fluid in their design the best design gets rolled out over five or ten years  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:44):**  as unnecessary work is is slowly eliminated but the more you plan for it at the start  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:51):**  the easier those little retrofits will be so that's why relative location within your  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:15:57):**  design is is very important like i was alluding to earlier you know like one for us for example  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:02):**  is is turning compost piles i remember when i first learned how to make compost and i  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:07):**  was like thought it was great and i was like oh i don't need to go to the gym anymore i'll  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:10):**  just turn compost but this is awesome it's a great workout but you know i'm i'm not getting  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:17):**  any younger i didn't i i was pretty honest with myself after a while and said i don't  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:23):**  want to turn a compost pile i'm gonna get my chickens and my worms and uh my you know  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:29):**  my other animals to do that for me and maybe i'll like clean out an animal pen once every  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:34):**  uh once every three months but it'll be one blast of work and then it's done and the and  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:40):**  the animals and the bacterias do all the rest of the work so it's like you know those kinds  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:45):**  of things being honest with yourself i think is like is very important yeah you really  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:49):**  do need to be honest with yourself about what you are likely to commit and if you don't  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:16:53):**  have a lot of experience working on farms or in living systems in the past be very conservative  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:00):**  with your estimates as to your own inputs as well as the budget that you have to put  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:05):**  into these things you can always advance things along faster if you have more time and energy  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:12):**  but if you plan for a certain amount of contribution that you're unable to match it's really going  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:16):**  to throw off the progress and the advancement of your goals so the last category within  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:21):**  this is utilities and especially water where does the water naturally flow and how can  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:27):**  it be harnessed for infiltration storage and dispersal now we analyze this pretty carefully  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:32):**  in our site analysis portion of this criteria now put all of this information to work for  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:38):**  you and see how you can manipulate the water flows for the advancement of the agenda that  
**[0:17:43-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:43):**  you have now where is your access to power i assume that most of you want access to electricity  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:51):**  just for the convenience of all the work that it can do now whether you are connecting to  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:17:55):**  a municipal electrical power line or if you're planning on going off grid and creating your  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:01):**  own energy you need to assess the potential for your site to receive those things do you  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:07):**  have power lines nearby do you have an ample supply of solar wind or even micro hydro in  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:14):**  order to generate your own and what is the most efficient way to access it and access  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:19):**  it more importantly where it's needed on the site so it's great if you've got power lines  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:24):**  right up to the border of your property but if your house is on the very far end within  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:30):**  your design you're going to spend a lot of money in putting in the infrastructure and  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:35):**  running the lines to get that energy to where you're actually going to use it so think long  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:42):**  term not just what is convenient at the moment as your site matures what are going to be  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:47):**  the needs and requirements for energy flows being imported from far away from here let's  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:18:54):**  move on to the last but most overlooked category of an effective design and that of course  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:00):**  is strategy now this is the part that is easiest to forget because it's talked about so little  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:06):**  in permaculture and holistic design circles but in our experience it can be a make or  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:11):**  break part of achieving your goals and the goals of your clients a good design can completely  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:16):**  fall apart or be executed poorly without a good plan and adequate preparation so take  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:22):**  your time on this section and go through it as many times as needed to feel confident  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:27):**  that everybody involved is on the same page and knows their expectations and responsibilities  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:33):**  yeah you know I think a key thing that a strategy and incorporates is a timeline you know it's  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:40):**  the difference between a vision and it's kind of like the combination of a vision a plan  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:47):**  and a timeline for me so you know you've got your vision you know where you want to get  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:52):**  to you've got your big dreams and then it's a strategy is being able to go year one year  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:19:58):**  two year five where are we going to get to and how and what are we going to do in what  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:04):**  order and who's going to do it you know that's essentially what you're talking about and  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:09):**  that allows you to then delineate responsibilities within your team or your organization or your  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:15):**  family or whatever it is and say okay we're going to make this happen and I think you  
**[0:20:23-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:23):**  know a good leader can keep the overall strategy in mind as you know it's almost like tracking  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:31):**  the course of a ship you know storms will come in you'll have to put out fires things  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:36):**  will change and and you'll get you know you'll also change exactly your your exact plans  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:42):**  and where you want to get to will change but you you sort of keep the overall course in  
**[0:20:47-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:47):**  mind so you know getting that clear and writing down those timelines and then revisiting them  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:20:59):**  regularly I think very very important yeah Neil outlined that very well so let's walk  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:05):**  through each of those things individually and start by setting priorities within your  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:10):**  inventory and your budget so start within your budget and resources list what can you  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:15):**  realistically complete in this first year the combination of what you have available  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:22):**  and the time you have to invest is going to be the determining factor here what among  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:26):**  the list of tasks and jobs to do are the most urgent the most important in the long run  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:33):**  and able to be completed at a high quality now the reason why I put this high quality  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:38):**  part at the end here is that there are a ton of things that you can do and just slap them  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:43):**  together that may function for a certain amount of time but there's a big difference between  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:49):**  doing something at a high quality and doing it adequately to get by in the short run if  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:54):**  you do it in the short run and just slap something together it's going to work for a little while  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:21:58):**  and might be essential to move things forward but you need to understand that those things  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:04):**  are going to need so much more maintenance in fact probably are going to be completely  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:09):**  rebuilt or restructured down the line much faster than if you're able to take a little  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:15):**  bit more time and perhaps put a little bit more resource into the construction or the  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:20):**  implementation of it looking kind of long term knowing that the maintenance is how you're  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:25):**  going to save within a longer time frame make sure that you assess the difference between  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:31):**  those so like we can slap together some furniture that will help us store some of our goods  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:37):**  and keep them out of the way and organize for now but already some of the stuff that  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:41):**  we put together really quickly or is that what we call it chapus here where we are has  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:47):**  already started to kind of fall apart and you know we did plan for that in the beginning  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:52):**  and we know that a lot of these things are going to require maintenance and as we kind  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:22:56):**  of have more time to invest in and money comes back in we'll be doing them at a much higher  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:01):**  standard yeah but it's also great for me it was a it was a great strategy because we looked  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:07):**  at what we wanted for example these animal systems goats goats chickens worms rabbits  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:14):**  and we were like all right we want all these things we know pretty much exactly where we  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:19):**  want to put them and how we want them to interact with everything but there's gonna be some  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:22):**  kinks in this we've got hilly rocky land a climate that we're still actually getting  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:28):**  used to i've been here for four years but i'm still learning about it and we know that  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:34):**  we could we were able to basically put this animal house together for you know minimal  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:39):**  costs we're left over building materials essentially and a lot of our own labor and we know that  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:46):**  as we iron out the kinks of it and especially look at like energy losses you know this is  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:51):**  taking too long this is annoying we'll be able to redesign it and rebuild it to be a permanent  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:23:58):**  structure but when we've received the feedback and you know this is just a good general point  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:03):**  it's like if you're planning on moving water around the site there's probably no need you  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:10):**  know eventually having those water lanes buried under your access lanes is a great point to  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:17):**  get to because it's great use of space and you know it's it just makes a lot of sense  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:23):**  to do it but for the first year or two there's no need to bury those water lanes and there's  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:28):**  no need to fix those pads anything that's not buried is really easy to change you know  
**[0:24:35-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:35):**  and putting in slapdash systems that you know you're going to improve before you like over  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:43):**  commit and build this really expensive thing that's going to be really hard to retrofit  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:47):**  you know those those can kind of work in your favor because it allows you to work on a budget  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:52):**  first until you get things to the way you really want them to be and then invest in  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:24:57):**  that extra little bit of efficiency or security or whatever you need to make a system that's  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:03):**  working pretty well that's where you dial it in a couple of years later I think yeah  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:09):**  Neil made a great point there I definitely advocate for planning in certain temporary  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:14):**  structures especially when you're not a hundred percent certain of how those designs are going  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:20):**  to work and how they're going to flow as you interact with them especially on our farm  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:24):**  we're doing a lot of experimental stuff here we're trying a lot of new things in order  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:28):**  to get the insights and the information needed to be able to confidently recommend or steer  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:35):**  clients and organizations in one direction or another based on what we've actually observed  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:41):**  and in order to do that we've needed to put up some temporary structures that will give  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:45):**  us that information without kind of committing us to a design that we're not yet sure is  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:51):**  going to work and I really encourage people to look seriously into temporary structures  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:25:56):**  especially if you're working from a limited budget and are not really certain about how  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:00):**  you're going to interact with them so moving now to strategy let's talk about what needs  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:05):**  to be designed bought and sourced and in what order of execution so what needs to be designed  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:12):**  before you begin in our case it was the animal structures the water access lines and especially  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:19):**  the house so one of the first things that we did even before we started putting in some  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:23):**  of the gardens was assessing where our permanent structure our living space and what's probably  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:29):**  going to serve as our offices is going to go where it makes sense on the landscape how  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:34):**  it can be integrated in the landscape so that it actually is improving the ecology around  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:39):**  it rather than just basically consuming resources and from there we started to design a lot  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:46):**  of the individual components of the farm around that what needs to be bought or sourced before  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:52):**  you begin this will give you an idea of how much of your budget is going to be taken up  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:26:57):**  by any individual task now hopefully if you've done your research well earlier in the stage  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:03):**  of this criteria you'll have a whole list of things that you already have access to  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:09):**  either for free or very cheap within your local community or ideally even on site that  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:14):**  can really really minimize the amount that needs to be bought or sourced from further  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:19):**  away now from there you want to break each of these into major tasks or each of these  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:26):**  major tasks into smaller individual tasks and order them appropriately so the obvious  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:32):**  example would be to build the foundations before the walls of your house but in a lot  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:37):**  of cases for developing land it would be improving the soil before you start to plan it out or  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:43):**  perhaps planning it with pioneer species that can help to improve the soil quality before  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:48):**  you start planning your cash crops or your food with this information you can start to  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:52):**  move forward with a more concise plan and breaking larger tasks into smaller tasks really  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:27:59):**  takes away the daunting aspect the fear that comes along with like oh my goodness this  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:05):**  is such a big undertaking how are we ever going to do this if you can break it down  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:09):**  into smaller actionable steps that take away the fear or some of the apprehension in getting  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:17):**  started you can look at it on like a day-to-day basis so you know we're slowly building fences  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:24):**  around some of our more vulnerable areas here on the farm but you can't do it in one day  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:29):**  so we put aside a couple of days for running the fence line a couple more days for putting  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:34):**  in the the access gates and the entrance points and there's probably going to be a little  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:40):**  bit of time in maintenance along the line because many of these have not been planted  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:45):**  out with the living fence which will eventually go in so breaking it down into smaller tasks  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:50):**  makes it much more manageable and less daunting of an undertaking yeah you know and also taking  
**[0:28:57-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:28:57):**  advice from people and you know looking at education time spent studying time spent observing  
**[0:29:05-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:05):**  as as as an investment you know you know there's great courses you can get there's great resources  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:13):**  out there that can really like fast track you and if not even fast track you just you  
**[0:29:19-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:19):**  know take look at the whole thing as a process which you know you will you will be continually  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:29):**  learning and evolving as you go so that as the landscape evolves you can you can respond  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:35):**  to it you know and a lot of this stuff is actually about being being comfortable to  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:41):**  get into the process and and out of the results you know I see definitely a lot of anxiety  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:48):**  in some people when they're starting these kinds of things because they want to have  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:53):**  the exact thing that they're going to do with their land or that or their project done but  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:29:58):**  actually having the sort of courage to go like all right I don't have these answers  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:04):**  now I don't actually know what this place is going to look like or what I'm going to  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:08):**  look like in a couple of years but just be committed to to this process and to going  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:13):**  like okay this is you know whatever stage we're at this is where we're at it's time  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:18):**  to observe it's time to read it's time to to research hopefully you know this podcast  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:24):**  and other kinds of things will will give you sort of a framework so that you can divide  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:29):**  up those tasks you know maybe you're at the point way back at the start where you just  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:34):**  need to do loads of reading about the climate you're in and identify it you know maybe you're  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:40):**  further down the line you need to learn a little bit about you know some patchwork designs  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:44):**  putting in ponds all the rest of it it's fine you know you get there all the information  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:49):**  is out there and there's just loads of people super happy to share it.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:55):**  So now that you have a framework and a bit of a plan moving forward your major tasks  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:30:59):**  are broken down into manageable steps we're coming along to the delegation and the accountability  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:04):**  portion and this is the last main portion that we have on this list because this is  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:08):**  where all the action happens now there's a good chance that you've already started to  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:12):**  implement certain things on your site and this is a good way of kind of reassessing  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:17):**  and making sure that everybody's on the same team and the delegation of tasks is really  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:22):**  important so that we don't have a whole lot of people working on the same thing that could  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:26):**  be done more efficiently with a little bit of structure.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:30):**  So with your list of most important goals now broken down into these manageable steps  
**[0:31:34-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:34):**  with at least a loose order of execution decide who should oversee each task and get some  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:42):**  accountability to make sure that those people follow through within a reasonable time frame.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:48):**  Ideally each task will be given to the person most able and enthusiastic about doing it  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:54):**  but we know that there are many tasks that no one really wants to do so try to divide  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:31:59):**  those tasks up evenly and equitably.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:02):**  So now if you're working in an organization many of these roles and responsibilities might  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:06):**  already be defined and in many cases however these roles need to be shifted or redefined  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:12):**  in order to accomplish your goals.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:15):**  The most important thing is to make sure that everyone is aware of their expectations and  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:19):**  everyone on the team understands the vision of the organization and are moving forward  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:23):**  together.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:24):**  Wow.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:25):**  OK.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:26):**  So in conclusion if you've made it this far you've already gone far beyond most designers  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:31):**  in planning and designing your projects and your future.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:35):**  Obviously every project is different just as every individual and organization has different  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:40):**  goals and resources.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:41):**  But with this level of consideration and observation you should easily avoid the most common pitfalls  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-part-2-of-ae-design-criteria-checklist/#t=0:32:46):**  and obstacles that hold designs back and sometimes even cause goals to be abandoned.

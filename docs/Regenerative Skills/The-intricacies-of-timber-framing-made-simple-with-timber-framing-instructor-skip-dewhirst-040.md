**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds of  
**[0:00:05-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:00:05):**  permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:00:08):**  As always, I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher, and I have a fantastic interview for you in  
**[0:00:12-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:00:12):**  this session, so stick around and we'll jump right on in.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:00:25):**  Before we get started this week, I'm proud to announce that Permaculture Magazine of

**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:23):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:26):**  I've gotten a lot of requests over the last few months from people asking if I can do  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:29):**  more on woodworking and especially timber framing.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:33):**  So today's episode is for you good folks.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:35):**  Today I'll be speaking with Skip Dewhurst, who has been a professional woodworker for  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:39):**  more than 30 years and has taught over 100 classes in furniture making, woodworking,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:44):**  timber framing and natural building at places like Rocky Mountain Workshops, Dartmouth College,  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:50):**  Rancho Massatale, Bonafide, Mau Organic Farm in Hawaii, and YesterMarl.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:01:57):**  In this interview Skip talks about the differences between the main styles of timber framing  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:00):**  around the world, box framing, cruck framing, and aisled framing, the many types of joints  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:06):**  and tools used in the trade, and even gives practical advice for owner-builders and novices  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:10):**  starting out.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:12):**  We go deep into different infill materials and techniques for the wall systems and the  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:16):**  different considerations to take into account if you're building in a cold or hot climate.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:21):**  There are a lot of technical terms in this episode and a lot of explanations of techniques  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:25):**  that may not make sense unless you see pictures.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:29):**  So I've put a whole lot of resources and visual aids in the show notes on the website to make  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:33):**  it easier to follow along.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:34):**  So just go to abundantedge.com and click to the podcast tab in the navigation bar to find  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:39):**  this and all previous episodes.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:41):**  Now I'll turn things over to Skip Dewhurst.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:44):**  Hey Skip, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:47):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:48):**  I'm doing well, thank you.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:50):**  Are things starting to get a little cold where you are up in New England?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:53):**  It's actually been a really warm fall.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:56):**  It's a beautiful sunny day today.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:02:59):**  We've actually just had one hard frost.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:03):**  That's kind of unusual for being towards the end of October.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:06):**  Wow.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:07):**  Yeah, I actually just got back from New Jersey where I was visiting family for a little while  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:11):**  and the weather was gorgeous up until last week.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:14):**  You're getting a pretty mild autumn it seems.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:18):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:19):**  Well hey, how about we jump into some of the questions here.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:21):**  I know I've got a lot of content that I'd love to cover with you.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:24):**  So before we get into all the timber framing and woodworking stuff, could you tell our  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:28):**  listeners a bit about yourself, your background, and how you got started in woodcrafts?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:34):**  Sure.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:36):**  I became interested in woodworking mainly inspired by my grandmother.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:41):**  My grandmother, whenever my brothers and sisters would visit, she would get us involved in  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:48):**  different arts and crafts projects and she was the kind of person that if she needed  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:51):**  something she would just build it.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:03:54):**  That gave me the confidence to do the same and I became very interested in woodworking.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:00):**  I guess in high school shop class I learned a bit and there was always tools around the  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:06):**  house that I started using more and more.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:09):**  And took a furniture design class in college and worked in cabinet shops during the summers  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:15):**  in college.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:17):**  And shortly after that began my own woodworking business building furniture and always had  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:25):**  a dream of building my own house.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:27):**  And so about 22, 23 years ago, I built a timber frame home and shortly after I built that  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:35):**  home other people started asking me to build timber frames for them.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:39):**  So since then I've been building houses and barns and pavilions and I continue with my  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:48):**  furniture business but I keep pretty busy building furniture and timber frames and have  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:54):**  been teaching both woodworking and timber framing for about 20 years I think.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:04:59):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:00):**  That's a wonderful story.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:02):**  I know I was also inspired a lot by people in my family who kind of pushed me to make  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:08):**  some of the things that I talked about or wanted rather than just go out to purchase  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:13):**  them.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:14):**  Now I know that timber framing is not just one narrow definition but rather a group of  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:19):**  different techniques from around the world.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:21):**  So let me start by asking what is timber framing and how is it different than a stud frame  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:27):**  or post and beam structure?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:32):**  That's a great question and different people will give you different answers but in the  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:35):**  timber framing world I would say that most timber framers would answer that question  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:40):**  by saying timber frame construction has mortise and tenon joinery held together with pegs.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:48):**  Stud construction is smaller members usually 2x4, 2x6, 2x8.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:05:55):**  They're held together with nails and post and beam can be large timbers but they're  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:01):**  usually held together with metal brackets and fasteners.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:05):**  And again so timber frame is mostly held together with mortise and tenon joints held together  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:14):**  with pegs.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:16):**  Now the real art in timber framing I know is in those joints that you mentioned.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:20):**  Could you list off some of the most common joints other than just mortise and tenon and  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:25):**  describe how they're made and what they're used for?  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:29):**  Yeah so I would say the mortise and tenon is really the workhorse of timber framing  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:33):**  and there's lots of variations on the mortise and tenon but I'd say 90 to 95% of the joints  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:41):**  in a timber frame are going to be mortise and tenon.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:45):**  Some other joints would be spline joints which is again that's a variation of a mortise and  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:51):**  tenon.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:52):**  A spline joint is some people call it a loose tenon.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:06:58):**  It's interesting the French call it a prisoner tenon but it's all the members that come together  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:05):**  would all have a mortise in them and then a separate piece would be the loose tenon  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:11):**  that would fit in and be pegged in the mortise members.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:16):**  And so that's an interesting one and that's often used in three or four way connections  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:21):**  where you have multiple pieces coming into a post very close to each other where if you  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:27):**  just did a traditional mortise and tenon there would not be enough room to have good strong  
**[0:07:34-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:34):**  connections so that loose tenon enables you to make a real strong connection and not take  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:42):**  too much wood out of the post.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:47):**  Other joints would be a scarf joint which is used to make longer timbers if your saw  
**[0:07:57-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:07:57):**  your cant saw say a 40 or 50 foot timber and you have a big barn or need a large timber  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:06):**  you can scarf together shorter timbers to make a long timber.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:10):**  It's never going to be as strong as a tree would have grown but it's a good compromise  
**[0:08:16-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:16):**  it enables you to get a longer timber by scarfing two pieces together.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:24):**  There's lots of variations of a scarf joint but the most common one is imagine a long  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:32):**  angle that's cut and then sometimes they have mortise and tenons at the end of the scarf  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:37):**  joint.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:38):**  Go ahead.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:39):**  For those of us who aren't familiar with some of the jargon can you just describe what a  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:48):**  mortise is what a tenon is and how they go together and are kept that way?  
**[0:08:53-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:08:53):**  Sure so imagine a tenon being a narrower part of a beam that and often in a timber frame  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:05):**  it'll be two inches wide and it'll be the full height of the beam and then a mortise  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:11):**  will be the receiving it will receive the tenon so it'll be a slot that the tenon slides  
**[0:09:17-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:17):**  into and it will there will be a peg at least one peg sometimes depending on the size of  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:25):**  the timber sometimes three or four pegs and the peg will go through both the mortise and  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:31):**  tenon and that is what holds the joint together.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:35):**  So it's like I guess to put it in other construction terms there's the female end and there's the  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:41):**  male end and the tenon is the male end going into the mortise which is the cutout recess  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:47):**  and the peg cuts through both of those and holds them keeping that tenon from slipping  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:53):**  out is that correct?  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:55):**  That is correct.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:09:56):**  Okay so now no go ahead.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:00):**  I was going to say another variation of the mortise and tenon joint and it is it's actually  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:05):**  one of my favorite joints.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:09):**  Imagine that that same joint that we just described in tension the only thing that's  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:12):**  holding it together is the pegs and so there's a variation that is much stronger it's called  
**[0:10:18-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:18):**  a wedged half dovetail and it's a half dovetail shaped tenon that fits into a full dovetail  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:26):**  shaped mortise and then there's a wedge that fills the upper portion of the wedge of the  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:34):**  dovetail shaped void so the wedge shape of the tenon and a peg makes that joint very  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:42):**  very strong in tension and that's that's actually one of the strongest joints that I know how  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:47):**  to make and it's often used for a tie beam which is tying the walls of a timber frame  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:51):**  together.  
**[0:10:52-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:10:52):**  Sure and I'll put links to some visualizations maybe some manuals or some other resources  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:00):**  so that if anybody's having trouble visualizing what we're talking about here they can find  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:04):**  pictures that'll help it to make more sense.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:09):**  Now like I was saying timber framing is a number of different practices and traditions  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:14):**  from around the world it's not just one thing.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:17):**  Could you tell us the difference between box frames, crook frames, and aisled frames and  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:22):**  maybe give me an example of how each one might be used?  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:27):**  Sure I'm going to start with crook frames because I think that's the easiest to visualize  
**[0:11:33-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:33):**  so and probably one of the earlier versions so a crook frame is a frame that's made out  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:43):**  of naturally curved timber the primary structural members are called crux and what they are  
**[0:11:49-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:11:49):**  is big huge curved trees and that tradition came out of I think in England the trees were  
**[0:12:00-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:00):**  almost all saved for or the big tall straight trees were used in the shipbuilding industry  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:08):**  and peasants who wanted to build their houses were not allowed to cut down trees by you  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:16):**  know I think it was royal decree that there's a lot of trees that they were not able to  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:21):**  cut down so they were left with the scraggly curvy ones at the edges of fields that you  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:26):**  know curved because they were growing from the edges of forests and curving out to get  
**[0:12:32-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:32):**  the light from the field and those curved members were kind of undesirable wood for  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:41):**  building ships masks and things like that they were not used very often although they  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:45):**  were used for making the prows of ships and certain curved parts and ships but that was  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:51):**  for the most part undesirable wood and so peasants made learned how to construct houses  
**[0:12:57-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:12:57):**  out of that and they utilized those curved members to hold up the ridge of the house  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:13:05):**  and support the rafters so visually what a crux frame looks like is too often bookmatched  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:13:12):**  but two similar curves that come up to the peak or close to the peak of the roof and  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:13:18):**  support the weight of the structure and then smaller timbers in filled around it to fill  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:13:24):**  out the shape of the house generally those crux frames were not real large structures  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:13:31):**  just because those curved pieces tended to be smaller so you wouldn't generally see really  
**[0:13:39-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:13:39):**  large structures made that way some some barns were made that way but it was primarily house  
**[0:13:47-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:13:47):**  construction and the aisled timber frames mainly came out of the farming industry making  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:13:55):**  big large aisled barns and the purpose for the aisles was to separate where the animals  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:02):**  stayed and where the hay was stored or different functions that happened on the farm so the  
**[0:14:08-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:08):**  aisled barns were designed specifically for agricultural use and farmers to make a separation  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:19):**  of the different spaces in large barns and then box framing was typically more house  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:27):**  construction or just more open floor plan where the posts and the frame didn't delineate  
**[0:14:34-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:34):**  the uses of the house it was just the perimeter of the frame was the main structural part  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:42):**  and there might be posts in the middle but the post didn't necessarily delineate specific  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:47):**  use spaces in the building.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:50):**  Fantastic so box frames are probably what you're more likely to see anytime that you're  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:55):**  building kind of a modest structure or a modern house?  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:14:59):**  Yes.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:01):**  Excellent now let's go into some of the varieties and intricacies of types of timber framing  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:09):**  from around the world I know there's many variations and perhaps the most famous ones  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:14):**  are the traditions from England, Germany, and Japan how have these different styles  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:20):**  informed your own trade and what are some of the most notable points that someone could  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:25):**  draw from from each of these traditions?  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:30):**  Well I would say I learned the craft in America and America really you know being the melting  
**[0:15:37-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:37):**  pot the English and German traditions and to a lesser extent the Japanese traditions  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:45):**  really informed American timber framing when it first started immigrants from England and  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:51):**  Germany and France and many other countries but the immigrants came and brought timber  
**[0:15:58-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:15:58):**  framing to America and just like music all the different cultures that came and brought  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:16:08):**  their musical styles influenced amazing music that happened in America the same thing happened  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:16:15):**  with timber framing you had immigrants bringing their versions of the craft that they learned  
**[0:16:22-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:16:22):**  in their country here and teaching other people and American timber framing really was a an  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:16:32):**  amalgamation of the timber framing from England and Germany and again to a lesser extent Japan  
**[0:16:39-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:16:39):**  but certainly that influenced it as well and I would say that the main timber framing in  
**[0:16:50-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:16:50):**  New England that you see is a real blend of those different traditions and with some traditions  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:00):**  that started right here in America some changes from that and it's interesting to look at  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:04):**  the buildings that were made here in the 1800s and even earlier and then to look at buildings  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:10):**  that were made in England and Germany before that time and to see the changes that had  
**[0:17:16-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:16):**  happened and there was a system that was developed in America because of the different timber  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:25):**  framing traditions that came here and that the system that developed here developed because  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:31):**  of the different traditions but also because the wood source here was so much different  
**[0:17:35-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:35):**  than what was in Europe at the time and so the just like with with music different parts  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:49):**  of those traditions really influenced it and certain people took either what they learned  
**[0:17:56-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:17:56):**  from say a German craftsman and put their their spin on it but they also took what they  
**[0:18:05-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:05):**  learned from other people and it really evolved into a kind of a new kind of timber framing  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:12):**  that it has subtle differences it still uses some of the exact same joinering but the system  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:19):**  of layout and the system of marking the timbers was quite a bit different and then modern  
**[0:18:26-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:26):**  day timber framing mainly evolved due to use of tools and the fact that the sawmills were  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:34):**  able to produce timbers that are very accurate in in size and very well milled so that they  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:42):**  don't vary from one end of the timber to the to the next.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:47):**  Okay so they're working with more of the consistencies that are available commercially now.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:51):**  Yes.  
**[0:18:52-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:18:52):**  Wonderful, now could you tell our listeners about what some of the advantages and disadvantages  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:00):**  of timber frame building are?  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:02):**  Are there any places or climates where you would advise against using this method?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:09):**  I guess the places where I would advise against using it is any place that doesn't have suitable  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:17):**  trees.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:18):**  That's a good criteria.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:22):**  If a place has suitable trees then I think it probably is a suitable place to build timber  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:30):**  framing.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:31):**  I've built timber frames a lot in New England and I've also built quite a few in Latin America  
**[0:19:39-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:39):**  and I began in Latin America I had been teaching natural building classes down there for years  
**[0:19:47-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:47):**  and the folks that hosted the natural building classes kept on asking us to build, I say  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:19:55):**  us, my wife and myself, Elizabeth Boniz and myself have been going down and teaching these  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:02):**  natural building classes and the folks at Rancho Mastatal where we had been teaching  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:07):**  had asked us to do timber framing classes because they knew that we knew how to do that  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:12):**  and we kept on saying no and it was primarily because of tools and I didn't think that we  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:18):**  could get well milled timbers down there.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:21):**  A chainsaw mill is an amazing thing but it's really hard to get well sawn timbers and especially  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:28):**  teaching a class it's difficult to teach a class if the timbers aren't of fairly good  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:34):**  quality so we kept on saying no and then one year he said hey somebody moved in 10k down  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:41):**  the road with a wood miser would you do a timber frame class now and we said yes and  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:47):**  I can't remember how many years ago that was but I think there's 14 or 15 timber frames  
**[0:20:53-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:20:53):**  in that little village now and one of the advantages of doing it in warmer climates  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:01):**  is that it actually uses less wood to build a timber frame if you're not also building  
**[0:21:08-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:08):**  another frame outside of it to be the enclosure system or the where you put insulation so  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:17):**  for an uninsulated building I believe that you can use less wood by using a timber frame  
**[0:21:23-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:23):**  and the reason for that is instead of having a two by four every 16 or 24 inches on center  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:30):**  you can have a larger timber say an eight by eight that might be eight or twelve but  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:37):**  apart from each other so if you did the math on that and there's a lot more to it than  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:42):**  that obviously but if you do the math on that if you're just building a frame a timber frame  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:48):**  can often use less wood than traditional stick framing and less wood it also means less sawing  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:21:56):**  because the same volume of wood in an eight by eight you'd have to make much more cuts  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:02):**  to make a bunch of two by eights obviously you need appropriate size trees for that so  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:09):**  that brings me into one of the disadvantages of it I live in a timber frame house in Vermont  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:16):**  and it obviously it's an insulated house we all in colder climates we all live in insulated  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:21):**  houses now the one disadvantage of a timber frame is if you're going to build a timber  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:28):**  frame you certainly want to see a timber frame and so that means you need to put the insulation  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:32):**  to the outside of the frame and so in a way that requires a redundant system the frame  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:39):**  is the structural skeleton if you will that holds up the house but it doesn't offer an  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:45):**  insulative cavity as if you want to still see the timbers so you have to build an insulative  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:51):**  cavity outside of the timbers and that uses more wood it doesn't have to be structural  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:22:58):**  really all it has to do is be a cavity for the insulation and has to yet need to be able  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:04):**  to hang your siding and your windows and doors on it but it's not holding up the snow load  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:10):**  of the roof because that's taken care of by the timber frame so it is a bit of a redundant  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:15):**  building system if you're going to insulate it and you still want to see the full depth  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:20):**  of the timbers so I would say that that's one of the main disadvantages of timber framing  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:27):**  and I used it when I first started timber framing I would say I was a purist and I was  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:31):**  just way into the history and the pure function of a timber frame but as time goes on I've  
**[0:23:38-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:38):**  certainly turned a little bit and I believe oftentimes a timber frame hybrid approach  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:47):**  is appropriate and in fact right now I'm in the middle of designing a large structure  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:23:52):**  for somebody and it is a hybrid it it's mainly a timber frame but it has two by twelve rafters  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:00):**  and the main reason for that is he wanted no posts in the middle of the floor upstairs  
**[0:24:07-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:07):**  and he didn't want to go through the expense of say stress skin panels on his roof so and  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:16):**  he didn't want to have the redundancy of timbered rafters and then throwing the insulative cavity  
**[0:24:24-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:24):**  timber depth on top of that so we just went with two by twelve two by twelves that are  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:34):**  twenty four inches on center that will give them insulation and it'll be the structure  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:38):**  for the roof.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:39):**  Sure that makes sense I'm actually I'm a lot like you when I first got started in natural  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:44):**  building I thought I was going to be a total purist I specialized in cob and I was looking  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:48):**  for every opportunity to put cob buildings around the world that I could and as I got  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:53):**  more experienced and went to different areas of the world where cob was not the most appropriate  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:24:58):**  building method I've really come around to seeing the value in hybrid structures like  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:03):**  you were talking about and how you can kind of maximize the benefits of the materials  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:08):**  that you have around you while also mitigating a lot of the disadvantages that would make  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:13):**  it either inappropriate or just impossible to build with in a new area so it definitely  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:19):**  rings true for me.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:21):**  Yeah I think that's in all things you know I mean that's really the permaculture approach  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:26):**  really you know yeah yeah taking advantage of all the resources and all the information  
**[0:25:32-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:32):**  at hand and using it in the most appropriate way and yeah being a purist in anything sometimes  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:40):**  isn't the best approach.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:41):**  Yeah maybe unless you stay put and you can be a purist in you know whatever local bio  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:46):**  region you're working in but my reach has gotten a lot broader than that.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:51):**  So okay so you talked in great detail about how to build and accommodate insulation for  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:25:56):**  a cold climate and I know you've also touched on your work down at Rancho Mastatal in Costa  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:01):**  Rica which is a tropical environment can you tell me how you would amend or make appropriate  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:06):**  a timber frame building for a tropical climate?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:11):**  Yeah so most of the buildings that we've built down there have been single story so they  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:15):**  didn't need to be an eight by eight post to me that would be a waste of wood for a small  
**[0:26:21-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:21):**  structure so we actually kind of modified the sizes of our joinery typically when we're  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:29):**  dealing with the eight by eight posts we would use two inch tenons and obviously two inch  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:35):**  mortises to account those tenons and sometimes with smaller timbers will go to an inch and  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:41):**  a half wide tenon.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:44):**  Down in Costa Rica and also we've taught in Nicaragua and Hawaii we've built with smaller  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:51):**  timbers because they didn't need to be so big there's no snow loads down there and if  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:26:57):**  we're just building a single floor building we've actually used timbers as small as five  
**[0:27:02-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:02):**  by fives and gone with a combination of inch and a half tenons and in some places even  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:10):**  one inch tenons.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:13):**  We built out of lots of different types of wood down in Costa Rica and Nicaragua and  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:19):**  some of them are hardwood and there's absolutely no reason for some of those joints to have  
**[0:27:24-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:24):**  large tenons so in some of those cases we've literally used one inch tenons and mortises  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:33):**  and as far as the infill goes we have done some pretty interesting well wattle and daub  
**[0:27:40-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:40):**  is a tradition from well it's been used all over the world but in timber frames you specifically  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:48):**  see it in infill frames all over Europe and we have used that technique down in Costa  
**[0:27:55-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:27:55):**  Rica and we've also done it with a combination of bamboo slats and also just tongue and groove  
**[0:28:06-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:06):**  wood slats with just with trim holding it to the frame.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:16):**  So yeah I'd say you know just boards and wattle and daub and bamboo and also we've used cob  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:26):**  on a couple of timber frames as well and we just found it used less material if we did  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:30):**  wattle and daub.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:32):**  Yeah you can always build a little bit thinner on your walls with wattle and daub.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:37):**  Yes.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:38):**  Nice now let's switch gears here a little bit I want to talk about some of the properties  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:42):**  of timber framing and I know this is going to seem counterintuitive to many of listeners  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:47):**  who since wood is obviously flammable will probably think that timber framing is going  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:53):**  to be a very flammable style of building but especially with larger diameter wood it's  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:28:59):**  actually more fire resistant than conventional stud framing can you explain to us why that  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:29:04):**  is?  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:29:05):**  I think it has to do with less corners and less surface area of wood with and also less  
**[0:29:12-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:29:12):**  little pockets you know with with 2x construction imagine again 2x material 16 or 24 on center  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:29:25):**  there's lots of little pieces and they're fairly close together so if a fire or a heat  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:29:33):**  source was near any one of those the chances of it catching on fire are you know going  
**[0:29:40-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:29:40):**  to be related to how close it was to the heat source with timbers they're much further apart  
**[0:29:48-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:29:48):**  so they're just less likely to be right near the heat source and the mass of them and the  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:29:58):**  less corners because there's less pieces and oftentimes in large timbers the corners will  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:04):**  be chamfered and it's really those corners that are the you know the thin part of wood  
**[0:30:10-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:10):**  that is most flammable and so just the large mass I mean imagine taking a torch or a match  
**[0:30:19-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:19):**  for that matter you know think of 2x4s as kindling and a large timber as a log you're  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:28):**  not going to light a fire by holding the match to a log but you would light a log by getting  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:34):**  a bunch of kindling burning does that make sense yeah no that's a great visual and the  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:38):**  way it's been explained to me too is like a new growth forest with a lot of small diameter  
**[0:30:43-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:43):**  trees is way more likely to go up in flames than an old growth forest with you know huge  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:50):**  trees that are possibly hundreds of years old just that density offers a lot of protection  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:30:56):**  and it's one of the reasons why forest fires were far less devastating in the past yeah  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:02):**  yeah and that's not to say a timber frame won't catch fire but no but yeah that's yeah  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:09):**  I think that's a good analogy now that you've sort of given us an idea of how timber framing  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:15):**  works and some of its properties let's talk about the tools that make it all happen and  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:19):**  this is always my favorite part because I love traditional woodworking tools what are  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:24):**  a few of the most common timber framing tools and how do you feel about sticking to the  
**[0:31:28-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:28):**  traditional hand tools versus electrical ones all right so a hand saw and a chisel with  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:40):**  a mallet are the primary tools in timber framing besides the layout tools so a steel square  
**[0:31:47-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:47):**  or a framing square is absolutely necessary for laying out as well as a chalk line and  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:31:55):**  tape measure and for making the mortises a boring machine which is some people refer  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:32:02):**  to it as a beam drill but imagine it's maybe you can link to a picture of one of these  
**[0:32:09-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:32:09):**  but imagine it's a drill press that you sit on and crank two handles and an auger bit  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:32:18):**  cuts into the wood and that you would make multiple holes and then clean out the corners  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:32:25):**  and the sides with the chisel and a mallet and with just those few tools you can build  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:32:31):**  an entire timber frame and I teach timber framing probably oh five or six times a year  
**[0:32:39-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:32:39):**  and almost always in the classes we focus on hand tools but we introduce power tools  
**[0:32:47-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:32:47):**  just to show how it's done professionally and for certain cuts like long rip cuts on  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:32:55):**  a rafter tail sometimes we'll demonstrate how to do it with a rip saw or an axe but  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:00):**  oftentimes it's just more practical if you have 18 rafters and you have to make a long  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:05):**  rip cut on them to do that with a circular saw so I guess that kind of segues right into  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:13):**  with the advent of electrical tools it certainly makes certain operations faster but there  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:19):**  is a real especially when you're learning you learn a lot more about the properties  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:26):**  of wood if you're cutting it with a hand tool a circular saw will cut right through a knot  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:32):**  and you'll feel it a little bit if you're attuned to using the tool but that if you  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:37):**  have a nice sharp blade on there and you're using it properly it'll cut right through  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:40):**  a knot without really hesitating when you're chiseling and you hit a knot you'll know it  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:46):**  and you'll learn a lot about the wood and that's one of the things that we always encourage  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:52):**  for many reasons when we're teaching is to try to avoid knots in your joinery one because  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:33:57):**  they're harder to cut through and two a knot is obviously where a branch grew out of the  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:02):**  tree and it's an interruption of the straight grain wood fibers and it tends to be denser  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:08):**  material and it's it's not pleasant to cut through with hand tools and it also depending  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:14):**  on where where the knot is in the joint it can make it weaker and so we encourage people  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:21):**  to learn to lay out and and avoid knots as best they can there's always you know sometimes  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:27):**  there's going to be a knot right in a joint but we try to avoid them in in the primary  
**[0:34:32-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:32):**  joints another electrical tool well let me I'd be remiss if I didn't mention axes and  
**[0:34:42-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:42):**  adzes those are some of my favorite tools to use and that's we don't really use axes  
**[0:34:49-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:49):**  for making tenons so much although many people do especially in England and Germany or or  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:34:57):**  did way in the past but I use them a lot for housings we haven't talked about housings  
**[0:35:03-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:35:03):**  yet but briefly wherever you have a tenon piece coming into a mortise piece of yet if  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:35:12):**  you have a beam that has a tendon on it and it's coming into a post that has a mortise  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:35:18):**  on it it'll often also have what's called a housing and what the housing is is it accepts  
**[0:35:25-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:35:25):**  the full width of the beam and it's usually in about an inch deep and it so therefore  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:35:34):**  the beam is resting not only just on its tenon but it's also the full width of the beam is  
**[0:35:40-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:35:40):**  housed into the post that making sense yeah yeah I'm with you so oftentimes I'll use an  
**[0:35:47-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:35:47):**  axe to cut out those housings and axes and adzes before there were accurate sawing obviously  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:35:55):**  people chop down trees and hewed them with an axe to make timbers brilliant so and that  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:00):**  came out great that's why some of these timber frames around the world are hundreds if not  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:06):**  I mean there's a couple examples of thousand-year-old buildings that are still still out yes yeah  
**[0:36:12-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:12):**  and yeah an axe is just an amazing tool and let me jump to the future and say a chain  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:20):**  mortiser is an amazing tool as well and what a chain mortiser is imagine that same boring  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:26):**  machine or that beam drill that I was talking about earlier imagine an electric chainsaw  
**[0:36:31-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:31):**  version of that that has actually a wide chain that sometimes is five or so chains wide and  
**[0:36:39-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:39):**  it is it looks kind of like a drill press but then it's an electrical chainsaw press  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:47):**  if you will that has a fence that goes against the side of the beam and you plunge it down  
**[0:36:54-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:36:54):**  to the required depth of the mortise and it'll actually cut a square hole into the timber  
**[0:37:02-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:37:02):**  and so you can make a mortise let's say two by eight inch long mortise you can make in  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:37:12):**  a minute or just over a minute whereas if you're doing that with a boring machine you'd  
**[0:37:18-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:37:18):**  bore probably four holes and then chisel it square and that might take you a half an hour  
**[0:37:27-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:37:27):**  or an hour if you were beginning sure that's a huge jump in efficiency yes and so and most  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:37:35):**  people are familiar with a circular saw and then timber framing we have many different  
**[0:37:40-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:37:40):**  sizes of circular saws and we also use chainsaws quite a bit to to rough out joinery but large  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:37:49):**  circular saws certainly make cutting something like a scarf joint very quick whereas if you  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:37:56):**  did that with a rip saw and an axe it takes quite a bit longer and another another amazing  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:04):**  tool which actually is as far as electric tools go I gotta say it's one of my favorites  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:09):**  it's a very expensive tool there's a portable bandsaw mill or a portable bandsaw and it  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:16):**  imagine a bandsaw kind of flipped upside down so instead of putting wood on the table and  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:20):**  running it through the blade you have a smaller version of that tool and you flip upside down  
**[0:38:25-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:25):**  and the table runs on the wood and you can cut you know the one that I'm familiar with  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:33):**  you can cut through 12 inches of timber with this tool and it cuts very accurately and  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:41):**  it's just a very fast way to do certain joints nice yeah yeah that was one of the more common  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:47):**  tools that you would use outside of that mostly I've seen portable bandsaws for metal work  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:53):**  but I could see that being extremely useful yes that actually reminds me of one of the  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:38:58):**  things that I learned from years on construction sites is people would often tell me like yeah  
**[0:39:03-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:03):**  of course you want to work up to using electronic or even gas-powered tools because of the efficiency  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:10):**  and stuff that you gain but there's a ton to be learned from starting with hand tools  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:15):**  and the more intimate relationship you're going to have with the process and the materials  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:20):**  that you're working with that will inform and keep you careful when you're using the  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:24):**  much more powerful electric or gas-powered tools and I've definitely found that to be  
**[0:39:30-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:30):**  true in my own experience it sounds like that's the method that you go through when you're  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:34):**  teaching new students as well yes that's true and again we primarily teach with hand tools  
**[0:39:40-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:40):**  and we often introduce the power tools mainly as a demonstration the last day of class to  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:48):**  show you know now that you've learned that if we showed them the first day everybody  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:53):**  would be mad at us then we said oh no yeah yeah yeah do it with hand tools but when you  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:39:57):**  show them on the last day and say if you're going to do this as a profession or if you're  
**[0:40:01-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:01):**  going to cut a big frame sometimes it's literally worth it to buy that tool and use it for the  
**[0:40:08-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:08):**  frame the resale value on a lot of those tools if you cut one frame with that tool you and  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:16):**  that you know you're not going to become a professional timber framer you just wanted  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:19):**  to build your own house or your own barn you can turn around and sell that tool for almost  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:24):**  as much as you paid for it and because of that there are used tools out there on the  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:30):**  market and so that's oftentimes what we direct people who are just going to do one project  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:36):**  to you know buy a used tool and then turn around and sell it once they've cut their  
**[0:40:40-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:40):**  frame because it does save a lot of time yeah yeah yeah definitely I mean even as I've become  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:47):**  more professional with my contracting operations I always look for used tools first partly  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:51):**  just because so many of the tools that were built you know 10 or 20 years ago were built  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:40:56):**  a lot better than the new ones and frankly if they're still alive now chances are they're  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:41:01):**  good enough that can still be prepared and refurbished for a lot of uses in the future  
**[0:41:07-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:41:07):**  as well yeah yeah and then I would say the same is true for chisels most of my timber  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:41:15):**  framing chisels are early American chisels that are you know at least a hundred years  
**[0:41:21-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:41:21):**  old I do have some newer chisels but the early American chisels are just incredible quality  
**[0:41:29-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:41:29):**  definitely and no going I was gonna say one of my favorite timber framing chisels that  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:41:39):**  I have is a Japanese timber framing chisel which is I say new at this point it's over  
**[0:41:45-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:41:45):**  20 years old but it is made in the same tradition it's a handmade tool that's made in the tradition  
**[0:41:55-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:41:55):**  going back hundreds of years and so it is as good as any very old chisel and that's  
**[0:42:03-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:03):**  I'd say my favorite chisel well yeah that would be for me too the Japanese make such  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:10):**  good tools yes they do man I could geek out with you about tools for the entire episode  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:16):**  and beyond but let's let's switch gears just one more time here I know we've already talked  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:21):**  about a couple of different methods of infilling timber frame walls and obviously you know  
**[0:42:26-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:26):**  the timber frame itself isn't going to give you a completed building so you're left to  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:30):**  fill in all of those spaces and sometimes that can be a fairly intricate job you've  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:34):**  mentioned possibly putting in an interior frame or an exterior frame depending on which  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:40):**  side you want to see the timbers for aesthetic reasons and you know obviously that needs  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:46):**  to be considered spacing wise for the R value that that would give you for the installation  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:50):**  that you'd be filling it in with but my question is how can timber frame be integrated with  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:42:55):**  other natural building materials both for insulation and like wattle and daub that you  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:00):**  talked about in tropical environments what are some of the other materials you've encountered  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:05):**  and are there any that you've worked with that you wouldn't recommend for this style  
**[0:43:09-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:09):**  of building well that's that's a big question yeah there's so many different materials out  
**[0:43:16-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:16):**  there and there so let's talk about one product real quick that is not considered a natural  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:24):**  building product but i'd mention it because it's probably the most common um insulative  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:30):**  method for timber frames since kind of the resurgence of timber framing in america in  
**[0:43:37-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:37):**  the 1970s and um and it helped the resurgence because it kind of solved the problem of uh  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:45):**  if you're going to build a timber frame house how do you insulate it and so there's a product  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:50):**  that came out and some people call them uh stress skin panels or curtain wall panels  
**[0:43:55-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:43:55):**  and it's basically a sandwich of osb or oriented strand board foam and the structural panels  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:03):**  had another layer of osb on the inside and then um if they were non-structural or curtain  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:10):**  wall panels they would be a sandwich of osb on the outside foam of whatever thickness  
**[0:44:15-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:15):**  you needed for your r value and then drywall on the inside um and the redundancy there  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:22):**  is you could build a whole house out of stress skin or stress skin panels that had no posts  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:28):**  and beams because those are structural insulated panels so um that is a very redundant system  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:34):**  but it was quick um but the panels are very expensive and they're made out of generally  
**[0:44:40-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:40):**  the foam was expanded polystyrene or you could also get urethane or one other material so  
**[0:44:48-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:48):**  that was one of the most common ways of insulating timber frames for many years now a lot of  
**[0:44:55-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:44:55):**  people have moved away from that and do an external light frame of whatever thickness  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:03):**  they need for their r value and blow in cellulose and that seems to work very well but again  
**[0:45:09-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:09):**  you do have a bit of that redundancy of the frame there's a new product out called gutex  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:16):**  have you heard of that no i haven't heard of that one i i have not worked with it yet  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:20):**  but some friends of mine have and i need to educate myself more about it but it's basically  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:25):**  sawdust and some sort of binder and there's lots of air spaces in the sawdust and it comes  
**[0:45:30-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:30):**  in large sheets so you can nail it or you can cut it on your table saw and you can i'm  
**[0:45:39-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:39):**  not sure if nails or screws or if it has special fasteners but it is a wood insulative product  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:48):**  i always thought that you could make stress skin panels and it has been done out of more  
**[0:45:53-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:45:53):**  friendly materials or out let me say natural materials instead of using or osp or oriented  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:02):**  strand board there has been experiments and there has been some small companies that did  
**[0:46:07-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:07):**  it for a while out of hemp fiber and then either hemp insulation or soy based insulation  
**[0:46:15-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:15):**  and again those were i i don't know experimental is maybe not the right word those were as  
**[0:46:21-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:21):**  far as i know short-lived products just because they they were made they were available but  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:29):**  they were shipping was cost prohibitive because they were generally made very far away from  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:34):**  new england but i thought that that panelized system if it could be made out of environmentally  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:40):**  friendly materials actually the panelized system works really well for timber frames  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:45):**  because you're not having to put up additional to buy material outside of the frame right  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:50):**  so you have a long way to go with that but that technology and the ideas are there we  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:46:55):**  just need the market for it to get a company committed to building those products so that  
**[0:47:03-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:03):**  we could start using them more sure have you found any that don't work very well with timber  
**[0:47:10-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:10):**  frame or just don't complement the material um no not really it's pretty versatile i mean  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:19):**  i know that there have been like adobe infills in certain parts of europe and other places  
**[0:47:24-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:24):**  where the thermal efficiency isn't nearly as necessary but i would imagine that also  
**[0:47:30-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:30):**  add a ton of heft to the yeah yeah and it just seems like waddling dob would make more  
**[0:47:36-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:36):**  sense to me than adobe just yeah i would think so too but although you do see brick infill  
**[0:47:43-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:43):**  timber frames in europe and you know adobe is essentially just a sun a sun baked brick  
**[0:47:50-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:50):**  so you know i guess it could work fine but it just seems to me waddle and dob is is fast  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:47:58):**  because you can fill in all this yeah that would be faster and a lot less material overall  
**[0:48:04-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:04):**  yeah seems that way yeah um and and i just want to mention briefly straw bale i've done  
**[0:48:12-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:12):**  quite a few timber frames with straw bale and um i i love straw bale but i would say  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:19):**  that it's uh it's tricky to do and it's a lot more expensive than most people think  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:25):**  it's tricky to do well and this is true of a lot of building materials but straw bales  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:30):**  more than any other um you absolutely must keep them dry during the entire building process  
**[0:48:37-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:37):**  and um water is always the enemy of any building material but all the more so with straw bale  
**[0:48:45-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:45):**  sure yeah like getting it cut and shaped to go in between all of the spaces that a timber  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:52):**  frame presents i would imagine is somewhat labor intensive well it's usually done outside  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:48:57):**  of the frame um but the main the main thing that makes it labor intensive is getting the  
**[0:49:03-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:03):**  proper air sealing and uh you know if you're gonna do an earthen plaster on the inside  
**[0:49:11-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:11):**  um we've done frames where we've rabbeted a slot so that the trowel could plaster back  
**[0:49:18-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:18):**  behind the timber so as the timber shrinks a little bit you don't get a big gap in the  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:22):**  plaster and that's it's an extra step but it has worked out really really well and we've  
**[0:49:27-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:27):**  worked with some some good friends maybe some folks that you know ace and deva who wrote  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:33):**  the book natural builders companion um they we worked with them on that technique of just  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:41):**  changing a couple of details in the way that we frame to make it easier for them to do  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:46):**  their air sealing and plastering nice i've also talked a lot with siggy cocoa about her  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:51):**  personal methods of marrying earthen materials straw bales and wood together those dissimilar  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:49:57):**  materials are usually where people have the most trouble yeah but back to your original  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:03):**  question i there's not a material that i've encountered or experimented with that i've  
**[0:50:09-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:09):**  found that did not work well nothing nothing comes to mind it's mostly just those joints  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:16):**  that maybe need some amendments or some consideration so that they don't you know either shrink  
**[0:50:20-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:20):**  or pull away or anything else yes nice so what advice would you give to owner builders  
**[0:50:27-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:27):**  who would like to try timber framing and what are some of the common pitfalls that they  
**[0:50:31-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:31):**  should avoid um i i guess the advice i would say is uh inform yourself research uh uh take  
**[0:50:43-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:43):**  a class yeah definitely um it can be very expensive to make a bad cut on a large piece  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:50):**  of wood yes yes that's true and you know and don't be afraid to ask for help i mean i i  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:50:56):**  was an owner builder myself and i've worked with a lot of owner builders and i would say  
**[0:51:00-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:00):**  um a good plan and you know thinking things out thoroughly and asking for help because  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:10):**  there's no need to reinvent the wheel there's a need to gather as much information and one  
**[0:51:14-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:14):**  of the frustrating things i find about that is different sources give you different information  
**[0:51:18-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:18):**  and then you're left with this quandary of like i'm not sure how to decide which one  
**[0:51:23-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:23):**  of these um credible sources i should um pay attention to because they're telling me different  
**[0:51:30-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:30):**  things don't let that paralyze you choose one and go right right no that can be very  
**[0:51:37-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:37):**  difficult especially with all the information that's accessible on the web yeah the the  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:43):**  paradox of choice definitely comes into play exactly and if you let that paralyze you into  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:48):**  not making any choice then you'll just have your dream that you don't make into a reality  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:53):**  for too long so i i would say it's very important to gather as much information as you can but  
**[0:51:58-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:51:58):**  at a certain point yeah don't let the choices bog you down and hold you back from actually  
**[0:52:03-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:03):**  doing it that's very good advice now like you were talking about taking classes how  
**[0:52:09-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:09):**  would you advise a novice builder sort of begin learning timber frame and traditional  
**[0:52:14-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:14):**  woodworking in general um you know one of the best ways is if you have the the option  
**[0:52:21-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:21):**  or the time is to join a crew and and go to a timber frame raising the timber framers  
**[0:52:28-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:28):**  guild is an organization that has conferences every year and multiple conferences every  
**[0:52:36-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:36):**  year they also have organizations and they have publications that list classes and they  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:45):**  also list raisings and going to raisings and just participating and or watching watching  
**[0:52:52-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:52):**  a timber frame go up you learn so much about timber framing um but yeah either taking a  
**[0:52:58-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:52:58):**  class or working on a on a timber frame crew learning how to cut the joints learn you know  
**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:06):**  cutting the joints after you cut one or two joints you just get a little bit faster and  
**[0:53:10-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:10):**  a little bit more efficient doing it the hardest part of timber framing is the layout the accurate  
**[0:53:16-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:16):**  laying out of the joints to be cut um again once once you have cut a few joints then you're  
**[0:53:26-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:26):**  less likely to make a mistake and you're just going to become more efficient at cutting  
**[0:53:30-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:30):**  those joints but the layout is the part that really um takes a lot of time and is one of  
**[0:53:38-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:38):**  the most important parts because you might cut a beautiful mortise but if it's in the  
**[0:53:42-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:42):**  wrong place yeah it's not going to help out anything at all you didn't do yourself a favor  
**[0:53:46-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:46):**  yeah um and that's even professionally um we check each other's layout erasing a pencil  
**[0:53:54-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:53:54):**  mark isn't that expensive getting a new timber often is expensive so um even professionally  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:03):**  one person lays out and somebody else checks the layout before any cutting is done and  
**[0:54:09-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:09):**  that yeah smart happens on all you know big dollar timbers you know we're cutting a bunch  
**[0:54:16-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:16):**  of braces um or rafters or something like that we might check one and then you know  
**[0:54:22-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:22):**  you're just gonna make 20 knee braces that are all the same say we don't you know in  
**[0:54:28-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:28):**  a class situation and in the beginning sure you should check each one but professionally  
**[0:54:33-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:33):**  we check all the larger timbers but smaller things like braces and floor joists um we  
**[0:54:39-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:39):**  generally don't check those because you know there's it's they're simpler and after you've  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:44):**  done a bunch of them you're less likely to make mistakes on those yeah that makes sense  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:49):**  nice well actually could you tell us a little bit as well about the courses that you teach  
**[0:54:54-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:54:54):**  through yestermorrow sure well i i i think what i'll say is i teach uh at yes tomorrow  
**[0:55:00-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:00):**  but i also teach at uh quite a few other places so um yeah at yes tomorrow i teach some woodworking  
**[0:55:07-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:07):**  classes and then i've uh i teach uh currently i think just two timber frame classes there  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:16):**  a year there was a time a few years back where i was teaching as many as six just at yes  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:21):**  tomorrow and that that became a little bit much and so we got some other people involved  
**[0:55:25-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:25):**  which is great to have um you know a lot more timber framing instructors there because there  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:32):**  was a time where i was teaching you know i had co-instructors but i was teaching almost  
**[0:55:37-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:37):**  every timber frame class that was there so now i don't have that pressure on me there's  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:41):**  quite a few other teams that teach timber framing there but i also teach at uh rocky  
**[0:55:46-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:46):**  mountain workshops out in colorado and uh teach at rancho mastatal and um this year  
**[0:55:55-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:55:55):**  my wife and i are going to be teaching a new class in uh wood valley farm on the big island  
**[0:56:01-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:56:01):**  in hawaii that happens in february that's exciting yeah and uh yeah we've taught out

**[0:58:38-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:58:38):**  we wrap up this show for the week i've got some exciting news about the upcoming months  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:58:42):**  and i'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of atitlan organics shad goodsy  
**[0:58:47-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:58:47):**  hey buddy what's new oh man so much is happening first off though i just want to say thanks  
**[0:58:53-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:58:53):**  for having me man i really love your podcast and i actually had a great time doing that  
**[0:58:57-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:58:57):**  interview back in one of the earlier episodes anyway probably what's most exciting is our  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:03):**  new collaboration between atitlan organics and abundant edge as you know we've been offering  
**[0:59:08-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:08):**  permaculture design courses for over six years now and they really have become a staple here  
**[0:59:13-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:13):**  in legat in particular though the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:18):**  for travelers gardeners architects basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this  
**[0:59:24-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:24):**  new paradigm of permaculture design like honestly you can't take this course and still see the  
**[0:59:31-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:31):**  world the same way afterward yeah it's life-changing but like i said what i'm most excited about  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:37):**  is that now thanks to our collaboration we're going to be able to offer your natural building  
**[0:59:42-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:42):**  course immediately after every one of our intro to permaculture courses literally this  
**[0:59:48-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:48):**  two-week offering is like possibly the most complete package that i know of available  
**[0:59:54-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:54):**  anywhere basically with these two courses alone i think that someone should have everything  
**[0:59:59-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=0:59:59):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle  
**[1:00:05-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:05):**  that's that's what i'm excited about man but uh yeah what about you what's going on man  
**[1:00:10-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:10):**  well you know already that me and the abundant edge team are gearing up for a big season  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:14):**  as well i mean starting in november we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:18):**  demonstration site which is of course right down the hill from your farm we'll be building  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:23):**  animal pens a classroom outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected to houses and it's  
**[1:00:29-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:29):**  all going to be made out of natural materials i mean the site is going to serve as a demonstration  
**[1:00:34-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:34):**  farm for perennial and regenerative farming methods for years and years to come and we'll  
**[1:00:39-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:39):**  even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn for themselves  
**[1:00:43-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:43):**  about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms heck yeah that  
**[1:00:49-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:49):**  sounds amazing man and honestly this is just about the best place in the world to learn  
**[1:00:53-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:53):**  all these things too i mean this little town is sununa in the gorgeous tropical mountains  
**[1:00:59-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:00:59):**  of guatemala like right here on the shores of legatitlan it's one of the most beautiful  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:03):**  places in the world and on top of that you have this traditional indigenous mayan culture  
**[1:01:08-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:08):**  that's still rich and alive and probably my favorite part is that we have this world international  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:14):**  community of alternative people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into  
**[1:01:19-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:19):**  practice i mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house you've got loads of  
**[1:01:24-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:24):**  things going on we got the projects that we've already talked about but you also have yoga  
**[1:01:28-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:28):**  retreat centers you have charlie rendell's natural bamboo building school you have love  
**[1:01:33-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:33):**  probiotics you got fungi academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your mind type  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:39):**  stuff i honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening yeah it really does and  
**[1:01:44-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:44):**  i want to get as many people as possible in on these projects but we've got to make sure  
**[1:01:49-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:49):**  that they've got the skills first so what do you say let's offer a big discount to those  
**[1:01:53-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:53):**  who sign up for both courses i mean all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house  
**[1:01:57-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:01:57):**  is already included in the tuition so this will be like the best deal that we've ever  
**[1:02:01-1:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:02:01):**  offered that's a great idea because i mean people can still take just one course if that's  
**[1:02:07-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:02:07):**  what they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks but this will actually make  
**[1:02:10-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:02:10):**  the two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people that way more people  
**[1:02:15-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-skip-dewhirst/#t=1:02:15):**  can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they want to do so hey

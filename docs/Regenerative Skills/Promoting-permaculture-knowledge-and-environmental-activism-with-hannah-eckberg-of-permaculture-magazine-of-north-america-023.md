**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:26):**  My guest today is Hannah Ekberg.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:28):**  Along with being the co-founder, editor, and creative director of Permaculture Magazine  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:32):**  of North America, Hannah has also been the president of Get Oil Out, which was recognized  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:38):**  as the US's first grassroots activist organization when she was only 19.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:43):**  Hannah also served as president of the United Hemp Council, promoting the agricultural and  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:48):**  environmental benefits of hemp.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:50):**  As a self-described optimizer, she is always looking for ways to make things better and  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:55):**  look at them from a different viewpoint.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:01:57):**  In this interview, Hannah talks about her experiences and lessons as a grassroots organizer,  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:03):**  and how as an editor, she's now helping to promote positive voices for change and regeneration  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:08):**  in the permaculture community and beyond.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:11):**  She also gives invaluable advice on how to make a difference in community organization  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:15):**  and empowerment.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:17):**  But better to let her do the talking, so here's Hannah.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:21):**  Hey, Hannah, thank you so much for taking the time to be here today.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:24):**  How are you?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:25):**  I'm great.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:26):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:27):**  I'm doing all right.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:28):**  We're staying dry for a change here in the rainy season, but I see clouds off in the  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:32):**  distance so that might not last very long.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:36):**  How are things where you are?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:37):**  I'm much drier.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:39):**  Currently, I'm in Santa Barbara in Southern California where we've been experiencing record  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:46):**  droughts except for a few storms this last winter.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:50):**  So I envy your rain.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:54):**  Well, let's hope things improve over there.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:56):**  Well, hey, Hannah, I've got a ton of questions for you.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:02:59):**  So what do you say we just jump right on in?  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:01):**  Excellent.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:02):**  All right.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:03):**  So before we get into any specifics, could you tell us a little bit about your background  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:07):**  and how you found your way into the world of permaculture?  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:12):**  Growing up in Santa Barbara and mostly up at Hollister Ranch, very close to nature and  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:20):**  living off the land for the most part, my family was just very intimate always with  
**[0:03:28-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:28):**  nature and the connections to it and doing all that we could to preserve it.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:38):**  When I was probably around 18 or so, my boyfriend at the time introduced me to the concepts  
**[0:03:45-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:45):**  of permaculture through the Santa Barbara Permaculture Network and Margie and Wes who  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:03:54):**  have just done such amazing jobs over the years to bring leading permaculture experts  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:00):**  to the area.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:02):**  So once I got Bill Mollison's book and started to dive into it, it was like, wow, this is  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:11):**  what I've been looking for my whole life.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:13):**  This is connecting the dots.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:15):**  This is providing the solutions and the answers to so many of my questions.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:20):**  So it was really empowering to discover permaculture.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:24):**  Yeah, I think a lot of people can relate to that sort of inspiration once they got in  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:29):**  contact with some of the resources and books and networks of people that there are out  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:33):**  there.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:36):**  So tell me a little bit more about how you grew up in the ranch setting.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:40):**  Were you actually involved in caring for the ranch and doing farm work?  
**[0:04:45-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:45):**  Well, I was there very young at the first day.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:04:53):**  When I was two, my father became manager of the 15,000-acre ranch.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:00):**  Yeah, it's a very large cattle ranch.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:04):**  Yeah, that's significant.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:06):**  So he managed the entire ranch and then it's divided into 100-acre parcels.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:11):**  So after a few years, we moved and we're just managing a 100-acre parcel.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:19):**  We had amazing orchards and gardens and sheep and horses.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:28):**  My parents were living the homestead life.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:31):**  They didn't really know about permaculture and really connecting all these dots.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:36):**  I really wish they had.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:38):**  It would have been just taken to a whole another level.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:41):**  But my mom made her bread.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:44):**  We baked pies.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:46):**  It was just really a dream situation for most of my childhood until Chevron and other oil  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:05:55):**  companies came and put a very deadly pipeline through the ranch.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:02):**  So at a very young age, I watched my parents do all that they could to protect the land  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:10):**  and the people and everything in the area from this pipeline that shouldn't have gone  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:16):**  through.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:17):**  So that really instilled in me a deep passion for activism as well as really seeing the  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:27):**  social injustice that comes along with the fossil fuel industry.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:34):**  Experiencing it firsthand really affected the rest of my life.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:38):**  So it steered me down this path that's helped me get to where I am now.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:43):**  That's a remarkable story.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:45):**  Now I know that you started out really early in environmental activism I believe as a result  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:51):**  of this pipeline that went through your land.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:53):**  Weren't you just 19 when you were the president of Get Oil Out?  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:06:57):**  Yeah, I was the youngest president of what is recognized as the oldest grassroots environmental  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:04):**  organization in the country.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:07):**  And it was, you know, being both maybe a little naive and not jaded and having more energy,  
**[0:07:17-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:17):**  I really think that people at a young age should get involved in activism as soon as  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:25):**  possible.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:27):**  It was fun being a leader in that.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:29):**  I was going to UCSB at the time.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:34):**  I was getting married.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:36):**  I was running another organization about industrial hemp and the benefits of it.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:41):**  It was a lot to take on, but doing the work with Get Oil Out or GU as it's commonly known  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:52):**  really fed my soul and gave me a real purpose.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:07:56):**  I changed our motto to GU Can, Get Oil Out, Clean Alternatives Now, and really brought  
**[0:08:04-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:04):**  it back to the grassroots activism and got a lot of students from the universities involved.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:12):**  And it was also really a thrill.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:15):**  I would walk into a boardroom or some big meeting where it would just be all these heads  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:20):**  of oil companies and then I'd come into the room and you could just see them be like,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:25):**  oh no, Hannah's here.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:27):**  That's right guys, I'm here to give you a hard time.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:32):**  I don't like what you're doing.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:35):**  So it just also was so positive working on the solutions, educating people about industrial  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:40):**  hemp, about permaculture, about all the different ways that we could be living our life to ease  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:46):**  our dependency on fossil fuels.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:49):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:50):**  Now, so how has that shaped the way that you've gotten involved yourself in other environmental  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:56):**  causes since then?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:08:57):**  Well, I've always seen the power of media to try to educate and encourage people to  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:05):**  get involved, really to just inspire them to action.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:11):**  And when I was growing up at Hollister Ranch as a young kid, I got real into photography  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:18):**  with that intent.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:19):**  How can I capture the beauty of nature so that people will want to do something about  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:24):**  it?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:25):**  And so as president of GU, I really brushed up on my media skills.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:33):**  I did a lot of interviews, a lot of writing, press conferences, hosted large events, really  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:41):**  did a lot to hone in on my public speaking skills and tried to develop methods for just  
**[0:09:49-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:49):**  swallowing my fear and try to turn that anxiety into a power tool for me instead.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:09:59):**  And just different ways to communicate to different people, to meet them where they're  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:04):**  at, show how something is affecting them, show them a better alternative, and then how  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:11):**  they can get involved in that alternative.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:15):**  And that's really kind of what I see my work now with Permaculture Magazine is doing.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:20):**  It's like, here's the problem, here's the solution, here's how you can be part of it.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:27):**  And so it's those earlier years, I mean now just a little bit over 20 years later, I'm  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:35):**  still doing the same kind of work but just in a different vein and it's great to be focused  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:40):**  more on the solutions than the fighting.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:44):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:45):**  Now, stepping back just a second, I wanted to understand a little bit more about how  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:49):**  Get Oil Out was classified as the first grassroots organization and how you sort of nurtured  
**[0:10:56-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:10:56):**  the response from local communities in order to get support and to increase your resources  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:05):**  and your clout through those avenues.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:08):**  Yeah, it's actually a very interesting history.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:14):**  There were other environmental organizations obviously in America, Sierra Club, Friends  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:21):**  of the Earth, lots of environmental groups but none that per se were classified as real  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:29):**  grassroots environmental organizations.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:34):**  And what's the distinction in that classification?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:37):**  Just really being there to encourage people to take action and to take action themselves  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:44):**  and to do more than just signing a letter or sending in money to the organization but  
**[0:11:51-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:11:51):**  to take to the streets, to call up their representatives, to do whatever it takes to get the mission  
**[0:12:01-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:01):**  done and also to do it in more of, yeah, people powered grassroots efforts rather than send  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:10):**  us your money and we're going to pay our president of our organization to go speak on your behalf.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:16):**  It's like, no, you guys get your asses down here and speak up and be a stronger voice.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:24):**  And so January 28th of 1969 in the Santa Barbara Channel there was a platform that had a large  
**[0:12:32-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:32):**  blowout and spewed millions of gallons of crude oil into the channel and as soon as  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:44):**  people saw it they were like, oh my God, we have to take action.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:49):**  And Bud Bottoms was working at the newspaper at the time, he got the calls, hearing this  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:54):**  was coming in, he's like, oh my God, we have to get oil out.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:12:58):**  And people did, they took to the streets, they did for the first time a lot of real  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:07):**  hands on action.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:08):**  I mean this was in 69, this is when people were protesting Vietnam War.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:13):**  This was right also around a time when there was a large trash barge I think in New York  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:20):**  that caught fire.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:22):**  There was a few other key environmental disasters during that year that just really made people  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:30):**  be like, oh my God, look at what we're doing to the environment, we cannot do this anymore.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:37):**  And so Nixon, President Nixon came out to visit Santa Barbara to see it.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:42):**  Of course they covered all the oil up with hay and it looked like there wasn't a big  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:47):**  deal.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:48):**  But the pressure from the people in Santa Barbara as well as when this got on the news,  
**[0:13:55-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:13:55):**  this is kind of when TV was first really showing news stories on TV to this effect.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:04):**  So people saw these images of dolphins, of whales, of birds, of seals, of all these animals  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:11):**  dying from the oil.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:13):**  It really struck people's heart chords.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:16):**  And so that next year we saw the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:24):**  Act, the Clean Water Act.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:26):**  1970 hosted the first Earth Day.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:30):**  It really jump started what we call the modern environmental movement because of this empowerment  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:38):**  to the people.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:40):**  And so goo's efforts in giving people clever ways to participate and then the encouragement  
**[0:14:47-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:47):**  and then the sort of like the family, the camaraderie, the knowing that you're not alone  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:55):**  in all of this, I think really made a difference.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:14:59):**  And so we really saw some of our strongest environmental laws that have been in play  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:07):**  now for over 45 years and now are greatly threatened again with the current administration.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:15):**  And so once again we're seeing the importance of people taking grassroots actions and speaking  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:23):**  up for what they believe in.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:25):**  And now it's perhaps more important than ever as we see the threat to these important laws.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:33):**  I very much agree and I really like what you said back there about empowerment and creativity  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:40):**  being some of the things that really bring people together and create that camaraderie  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:44):**  that sort of incentivizes people to get off their couch and take action to participate  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:51):**  in whatever little steps that they can.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:15:55):**  Now I know that you've also for a short time had an organization called Spreading Solutions  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:02):**  that was an event and media production company based around environmental efforts.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:07):**  Could you tell me a little bit about some of the projects that you produced through  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:10):**  there?  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:12):**  I did a short film about the oil spill for the 40th anniversary of it as an encouragement  
**[0:16:20-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:20):**  piece aimed mostly at university students to show them really what people could do at  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:30):**  any age and the importance of it.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:35):**  I also helped produce various different events including permaculture convergences and permaculture  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:43):**  design courses and a few other short films.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:49):**  Really it was just kind of my catch-all umbrella as a solopreneur, something to try to get  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:16:59):**  my feet more wet in media production.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:02):**  I started to produce a podcast under it, never took it to full production mode though because  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:11):**  I got sidetracked by the magazine.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:17):**  Really it was just the name said it all to me.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:22):**  What is my core mission?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:23):**  It's to spread solutions.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:25):**  It's to share these real concepts with people and so I continued to do a lot of education  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:31):**  work still around industrial hemp and the many benefits around cannabis and letting  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:37):**  people know about the health and environmental aspects there as well as just kind of being  
**[0:17:44-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:44):**  a linchpin to help start other conscious companies.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:52):**  It got pretty derailed when I lost my home and office in a forest fire here in Santa  
**[0:17:58-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:17:58):**  Barbara and was uninsured and not really able to pick up the pieces very well afterwards  
**[0:18:07-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:07):**  to replace my equipment and get going down the path that I was on.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:15):**  Life always throws unexpected wrenches and that was a big one in my life that I'm still  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:20):**  8 years later recovering from.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:25):**  My mission to spread solutions still holds true and so I'd like to see if that ever comes  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:32):**  back into a creation that is helping to get more projects out there.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:39):**  Wow, that is a remarkable and courageous story.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:42):**  I'm sorry to hear about your home but I'm very impressed at all the incredible work  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:46):**  that you've done since then and I think that's a good transition now to talk about the Permaculture  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:51):**  Magazine.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:52):**  I know that the anniversary of Permaculture Magazine North America just came up in the  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:18:59):**  first of June.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:00):**  Congratulations.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:01):**  Thank you.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:02):**  Yeah, could you tell me a little about how you and your colleague Cassie Langstra created  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:08):**  the North American version of the popular UK original?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:12):**  Yeah, so I met both Cassie and Maddie and Tim Harland, the owners and creators of Permaculture  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:22):**  Magazine.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:25):**  Met them all down at Permaculture Voices 2 in San Diego a few years ago and Cassie and  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:32):**  I became instant good friends and then I stayed in touch with Maddie and Tim as they returned  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:39):**  to England with hopes of getting my podcast on their website.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:45):**  And then when I went over for the International Permaculture Convergence in England in September  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:19:52):**  of 2015, I was hanging out with them and they're like, well, we've been looking for somebody  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:00):**  for several years to start the North American version, to start our first offshoot and we'd  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:06):**  like to see if you and Cassie would be interested in it.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:09):**  So it was like, whoa, okay, let me think about this.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:15):**  I emailed Cassie, we discussed it, we realized what an amazing opportunity it was and convinced  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:25):**  ourselves that we could do it and that it was worth the risk.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:29):**  And so we went for it and put together the business arrangements.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:33):**  We're kind of a pseudo franchise of them with a deal that works well enough for both of  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:40):**  us.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:41):**  We took over their distribution so we started in over a thousand stores throughout North  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:47):**  America with a well-loved and well-recognized name, just adding on the North America part.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:56):**  And it's been an amazing ride.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:20:59):**  Maddie and Tim are kind of like our English parents and work closely.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:05):**  They review the stories and give us their input and see what else we should add or this  
**[0:21:11-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:11):**  or that.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:12):**  We talk to them a lot about business strategy and how we can work together to just strengthen  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:20):**  the permaculture movement in general.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:22):**  That's really the basis of our work.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:25):**  How can we educate people?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:27):**  How can we tell the stories that are happening around the world?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:31):**  How can we make this a much stronger movement so that all involved are better taken care  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:40):**  of, better fed so that everybody's mission is more successful?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:45):**  Of course.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:46):**  Now, I think that's coming at a really important time in modern history, getting this information  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:51):**  out even further.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:52):**  Now, as editor and creative director for the Permaculture Magazine of North America, you  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:21:57):**  have your finger on the pulse of the innovations and changes in the permaculture and regenerative  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:02):**  lifestyle world.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:04):**  What have been some of the most important changes that you've observed since starting  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:08):**  the magazine a year ago?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:09):**  Damn good question.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:13):**  Well, you know, yeah, I have my finger on the pulse of the movement but really also  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:23):**  kind of in my own bubble of trying to work with all these different articles.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:29):**  I'm in contact daily with people really around the world even though North America is our  
**[0:22:34-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:34):**  territory of people from Latin American countries, Africa especially, all over that are working  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:44):**  on amazing projects.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:48):**  But I would see, I think, perhaps the most important, let's go down two paths.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:22:55):**  First, permaculture and regenerative ag's ability to help with climate change and we  
**[0:23:04-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:04):**  have a number of different articles and topics looking at that specifically in this next  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:11):**  issue that will be out September 1st including an interview with two of the editors from  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:18):**  Drawdown which is the most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming using  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:25):**  mostly regenerative ag practices.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:29):**  And so this book that was put together by Paul Hawken is an amazing resource to really  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:35):**  look at the potential of what we can do and how just changing our farming practices are  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:43):**  so important, changing our consumer habits, changing our attitude also to realize, wow,  
**[0:23:50-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:50):**  something can be done but we've got to jump in full force now and stop the pollution,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:23:58):**  stop the laws that are being reversed that protect our air quality and really put into  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:24:06):**  play a lot of the solutions either in our backyard or large scale.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:24:14):**  And so really I think as climate change becomes such an immediate topic around the world as  
**[0:24:22-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:24:22):**  its effects are really starting to show in devastating ways to give people hope that  
**[0:24:30-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:24:30):**  there is something that we can do to hopefully put it at stay and even start to reverse it.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:24:39):**  To me that's one of the most exciting things.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:24:43):**  And then the other path I would go down for that answer is the work that we're trying  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:24:49):**  to spotlight around social permaculture.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:24:53):**  And a lot of people, especially in the bubble within America, see the permaculture movement  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:02):**  as a rich white predominantly male movement.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:09):**  And I would just say to all those people, we'll step out of your bubble and look at  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:14):**  all the other people that are really doing this, not only around the world but also here  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:20):**  in our country.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:23):**  And I've got some really interesting interviews in our next issue looking at Sean who's called  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:32):**  the Sioux chef that is Lakota Sioux.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:38):**  And so he's working with permaculture and the native plants from his area to really  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:47):**  bring back the cultural foods of the area as well as to bring this to the attention  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:54):**  of people no matter where they're living.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:56):**  Okay, what did the natives eat?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:25:58):**  What were the native foods there?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:00):**  How can you incorporate them into your diet?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:03):**  And he has a great cookbook that we're going to have some recipes from called the Sioux  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:09):**  chef and just really exciting things that then he really draws it around to the cultural  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:15):**  and the social side and how native people and the indigenous people of this country  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:22):**  were so, what's the adjective I want to put in?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:28):**  You know, suppressed.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:29):**  So fill in the blank.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:30):**  There are so many adjectives you could put in there.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:32):**  There's so many, you know, but just having their food and their cultural torn from them  
**[0:26:39-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:39):**  and so many people living off handouts of the government of low quality, poor health  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:48):**  canned food.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:50):**  And so diabetes and heart disease and all of these issues are rampant in these communities.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:26:58):**  And so to use our sustainable ag practices to heal the health, to bring back more of  
**[0:27:05-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:05):**  that cultural connection, it just really is empowering and shows the closeness to food  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:15):**  and to cultures.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:17):**  And I also have an interview with Malik out of Detroit and the amazing work he's doing  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:24):**  there with the African American community who's basically going through the same thing.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:30):**  You know, torn from their land, torn from their culture, separated from their food history.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:39):**  And once again, now living mostly off handouts and welfare and in food deserts.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:47):**  And so the work he's doing to empower people, especially young people to learn gardening,  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:54):**  to provide healthy food for them.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:27:57):**  He's opening a cafe and soon a supermarket in areas where there's just, there's no decent  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:03):**  food.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:05):**  And once again, like the health effects and the cultural and the really the spiritual  
**[0:28:10-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:10):**  effects that it takes on people feeling disassociated from their past, from their people, from their  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:19):**  food.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:22):**  You know, I believe it's Jeff Lawton that has the famous quote, all the world's problems  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:27):**  can be solved in the garden.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:29):**  And the deeper I go with the social permaculture, the more I really believe that.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:35):**  And so it's a really exciting thing that I'm seeing in the movement throughout North America.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:43):**  And so I hope that Permaculture Magazine North America can continue to help shed light on  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:49):**  that and again, inspire people to bring these lessons into their own homes and gardens and  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:56):**  communities.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:57):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:28:58):**  I'm really glad that you brought that up, just how diverse and varied the people who  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:06):**  participate in Regenerative Ag, in Permaculture and so many of these other both grassroots  
**[0:29:12-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:12):**  and sort of mainstream efforts that are attempting to bring real lasting solutions that sustain  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:21):**  themselves and even go on to spread and improve their communities and improve the environment  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:27):**  are, you know, much further beyond just the demographics that sometimes get associated  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:33):**  with Permaculture.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:35):**  You know, it's like in all things, the people with the loudest voices get recognized the  
**[0:29:42-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:42):**  most and it's the humble quiet ones that are just busy doing their work and not busy making  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:52):**  a name for themselves.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:29:54):**  Those are the people to me that are the real movement and it's kind of time to bring more  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:00):**  grassroots to the Permaculture movement and to help raise up the people whose voices have  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:08):**  not been heard and to share their stories.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:12):**  And yeah, that's one of the main reasons I'm here and I really invite people if they have  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:17):**  their stories they want to share or if they have conscious business that they'd like to  
**[0:30:22-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:22):**  help promote anything, any feedback, any articles or questions that you would like to see, you  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:30):**  know, please be in touch.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:33):**  You can even just email me directly at hannah at permaculturemag.org and that's hannah at  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:44):**  permaculturemag.org because yeah, we're here to be a resource.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:50):**  And help grow the solutions.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:54):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:55):**  And I want to echo that as well.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:30:57):**  I mean, this podcast is really geared towards helping people find a voice for their projects  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:04):**  and their efforts that are working towards a regenerative future.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:07):**  So if anybody wants to reach out to me as well, the information will be at the end of  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:12):**  this episode.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:13):**  But I'm very glad that they have a platform both here and with your magazine to help get  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:18):**  their voices heard.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:20):**  Yeah, you know, and I want to say Oliver how excited I am to be collaborating with you  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:26):**  and having Permaculture Magazine North America come on as a sponsor of your podcast and really  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:33):**  looking forward to seeing how we can work together more as a team to spread this to  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:40):**  even more people.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:41):**  And so good things to come.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:45):**  Thank you.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:46):**  I'm a huge fan of what you do with the magazine, the voices that you promote, the information  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:51):**  that you help to get out to the larger community.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:54):**  I mean, this is everything that I aspire to be.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:31:56):**  So I'm more than honored to have you guys on and to be working with you as well.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:01):**  Aw, thank you.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:03):**  So what are some of the goals that you have for the magazine moving forward into year  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:08):**  two?  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:09):**  This is an exciting time.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:10):**  Oh gosh, really good question.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:14):**  I need to ask myself more.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:18):**  I just want to take it to the next level.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:23):**  It's really been primarily Cassie and myself and then our amazing graphic designer Lisa  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:30):**  Berry of Wish Media comes on to help with the graphic design and we have a small team  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:36):**  to help with the proofreading and again Maddie and Tim.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:40):**  It's been extremely overwhelming with just Cassie and myself.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:45):**  I can imagine.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:47):**  Get on you both.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:48):**  It's no small task putting out a publication like that and you do really well.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:53):**  Yeah, yeah, thank you.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:55):**  It's like gosh, if we hadn't had any idea, would we still do it?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:32:59):**  Yes, we would because we're in for the movement, for getting out the messages, for the earth.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:06):**  That's why I'm doing all of this and that's why I want to work harder even in year two  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:12):**  to reach more people.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:13):**  So personal goals for me is to build up the business more so that we could hopefully hire  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:20):**  some other people and some other help soon or even just bring on some more volunteers  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:26):**  or interns that can really help to take us to another level, bring on more conscious  
**[0:33:31-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:31):**  companies for advertising so that we can not only help create a change in how people consume  
**[0:33:40-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:40):**  and what products they consume but also to help keep us funded and printed but to really  
**[0:33:48-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:48):**  expand and keep the voices that have not been heard, giving them a platform.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:57):**  I want to bring this out to more people.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:33:59):**  I hope to use our one-year anniversary as a media campaign and my goal is to get on  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:07):**  the Daily Show.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:08):**  I want to get on Bill Maher and some of these shows where we can reach people that would  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:15):**  be very interested if they only knew about permaculture.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:19):**  And I think the time is ripe for opening up the door to invite more people in.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:28):**  So I hope that the magazine can do that.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:31):**  We'll also this summer be launching our Latin American section on our website so that we  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:39):**  have stories in both Spanish and English to really be a platform to share the amazing  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:46):**  knowledge and practice that's coming out of both Mexico and then all the countries  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:51):**  south and also…  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:53):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:54):**  I'll follow that really closely.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:34:56):**  And let me know of any stories that you know that should be highlighted.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:00):**  Oh, I could throw a ton your way already.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:03):**  Some of the organizations that I work with here are doing fantastic work and could definitely  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:07):**  use the exposure of being written about.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:11):**  I'm really excited to do that.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:14):**  When I was in Cuba in November, I was just so amazed at how beyond willing the people  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:22):**  were, the farmers who learned a new technique, they just wanted to share it with all their  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:26):**  fellow farmers and get it out there.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:31):**  And so I think in North America or at least in America, we tend to live in our silos and  
**[0:35:37-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:37):**  our bubbles and think that everything is how we see it just around our little area and  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:44):**  there's so much more.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:46):**  And so taking the holistic approach to life that permaculture offers, I hope that we extend  
**[0:35:54-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:35:54):**  that beyond and really realize that we're all citizens of this planet and the more we  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:03):**  can do to help it, the more we do to help ourselves.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:07):**  So I guess that's my goal for year two.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:09):**  Hey, at least you keep your ambitions pretty low.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:14):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:15):**  Nice and in check.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:16):**  No, that's fantastic.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:17):**  I think that's really well said.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:19):**  Now I want to get to two questions that I just want your personal opinion on here.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:24):**  Now as someone who has worked for environmental advocacy groups and taken on an activist role  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:32):**  since the very beginning, what advice would you have to other people who are pushing to  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:37):**  advance an environmental or social goal towards a better future based on what you've learned  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:44):**  about what's been effective in your own experience?  
**[0:36:48-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:36:48):**  All right, you know the main thing that comes to mind is to not burn out, to reach out to  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:01):**  others to see who else is working on similar things, to not see them as competition but  
**[0:37:08-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:08):**  to see how you can collaborate to make as strong bonds as possible while still holding  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:16):**  your piece of the puzzle.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:20):**  That's what I learned from doing goo.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:24):**  I needed to bring on more help for the core of it so that I could keep sustaining myself  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:32):**  and I think that's where we're at with the magazine also.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:36):**  So I'm giving that advice to myself right now, really collaborate rather than burn out.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:44):**  And also to keep the big picture in mind and if you ever do start to burn out or get, you  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:37:58):**  know, asking yourself why are you doing this, why are you working so hard to remember the  
**[0:38:04-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:04):**  greater good of it all and what started driving you down that path in the first place and  
**[0:38:13-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:13):**  to stay creative and know that staying positive and working on the solutions is the best thing  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:23):**  that can be done right now and that there's so much that needs to be done and so everybody  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:29):**  plays their part, we can really see big global change.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:36):**  That's fantastic advice.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:37):**  Now before I let you go here, I would love to get your opinion as well on what inspires  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:43):**  you most about the potential for regenerative human interaction with the environment, especially  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:48):**  as we move forward into a pretty challenging future.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:51):**  God, you know, just every time I step into nature, my soul is so fed.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:38:59):**  I was just house-sitting where there was a quote written on the wall by Carl Jung and  
**[0:39:04-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:39:04):**  it's the natural world is the soil that feeds the soul and to just every time I step into  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:39:15):**  nature and feel that energy that feeds my soul, like this is why I'm doing it and for  
**[0:39:23-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:39:23):**  the animals, for the other inhabitants of this planet, you know, we kind of reworked  
**[0:39:31-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:39:31):**  the three core ethics and the way we present them to care for the planet, care for its  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:39:39):**  inhabitants and care for the future.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:39:43):**  And so for me, that's kind of the main thing, but the potential, the dream of the future  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:39:52):**  that I hold that I try to fall asleep to at night, that I try to wake up to in the morning  
**[0:39:57-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:39:57):**  is, yeah, where everybody sees all other inhabitants of this planet as fellow beings, kind of fellow  
**[0:40:08-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:40:08):**  cells that are making up Gaia and the more we can just get along and help each other,  
**[0:40:18-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:40:18):**  the more beneficial it is, the whole capitalism competition, extractionary model that we've  
**[0:40:27-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:40:27):**  lived our lives under just doesn't work and we're seeing the effects of that now.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:40:34):**  And so to try to go to the opposite end of the spectrum and love each other and help  
**[0:40:41-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:40:41):**  support each other, it just could make a more utopian world than we can even imagine.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:40:49):**  And while we may not get there in our lifetime, working towards that vision is so important.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:40:57):**  That's why I was spreading solutions.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:40:58):**  I was working on creating positive media.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:02):**  Let's not do another movie about Armageddon.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:05):**  Let's do a movie about what if we shifted?  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:08):**  What if we went towards the positive end?  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:10):**  How would that look?  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:12):**  And so that's what we try to do with the magazine is give people visions of how things can be  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:19):**  by spotlighting stories that are already happening.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:23):**  And so that's my long-winded answer.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:27):**  That's brilliant.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:28):**  I think that answer will resonate with a lot of people, especially in the permaculture  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:32):**  community and I commend you for the work that you've already done and that you and Cassie  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:36):**  have done through the magazine.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:38):**  Before I let you go, Ken, you just reiterate how people can get in touch with you, especially  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:42):**  if they want to help to contribute to the magazine or find other resources that the  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:47):**  magazine puts out.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:50):**  Well, we've got a lot of upcoming events that we are helping to promote including the next  
**[0:41:56-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:41:56):**  international permaculture convergence that's going to be in India the end of this November.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:04):**  Really encourage people to check that out, the IPCindia.org.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:09):**  But you can find links to that and lots of other fabulous events throughout North America  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:14):**  at our website, permaculturemag.org.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:19):**  And that's also where you can subscribe.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:23):**  And if you get the print subscription, as an added bonus, you get the 25-year archive  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:28):**  of our parent magazine in a digital form.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:32):**  So it's just an extreme wealth of knowledge.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:36):**  And so that's going to be available through this next year as a special bonus to early  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:41):**  subscribers.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:43):**  And then I know you're going to put in your show notes a discount code for our digital  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:47):**  subscription for people who are either out of the country or just don't want to deal  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:52):**  with paper.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:53):**  Of course, yeah.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:54):**  That's a whole thing too.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:42:57):**  It is eco-friendly paper but still.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:00):**  No, I mean that's a place for me because unfortunately I don't have an address here in Guatemala.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:05):**  They don't have a central mail system.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:08):**  So that's been the option that I've gone through.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:10):**  And it's a very generous discount for people who are looking to go that route.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:16):**  And we also put a whole variety of different articles for free on our website.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:22):**  And that's where we'll host the bilingual section for free.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:26):**  And so we have classifieds and course listings and just such a wealth of knowledge that I  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:32):**  really encourage people to check back regularly on our website.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:37):**  And then yes, if you're interested in submitting a story or have any questions or advertising  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:43):**  or classified or course listing you want to do, you can send that in either to submissions  
**[0:43:50-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:50):**  at permaculturemag.org or directly to me at hannah at permaculturemag.org.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:43:58):**  And that's Hannah the palindrome.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:44:01):**  So yeah, a lot of ways to educate yourself, to keep involved.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:44:08):**  Let me know your thoughts, your concerns, your questions.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:44:12):**  How can we move through this interesting phase together to create a better future?  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:44:20):**  You know, the work with Get Oil Out from so long ago that they did in 69, I think is really  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:44:27):**  good lessons for where we're at today and to know that coming together in a grassroots  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:44:31):**  model we can change the world.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:44:34):**  And that's what permaculture is about.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-hannah-eckberg/#t=0:44:36):**  Absolutely.

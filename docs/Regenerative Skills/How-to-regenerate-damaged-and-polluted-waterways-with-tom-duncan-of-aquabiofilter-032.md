**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:01:26):**  Alright, I'm really excited about today's guest.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:01:30):**  In this episode I'll be speaking to Tom Duncan, one of the visionary leaders behind Aqua Biofilter,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:01:36):**  a water cleaning and regeneration company based in Melbourne, Australia.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:01:40):**  Now Tom has been involved in some of the most ambitious and successful watershed cleanup  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:01:45):**  operations in history with major projects in China, Malaysia, and Australia that have  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:01:50):**  helped to restore lakes, rivers, and wildlife reserves.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:01:55):**  I became inspired by Tom's work after seeing his webinar presentation on the Sustainable  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:01:59):**  Design Masterclass with Neil Spackman and Riley Latham a few weeks ago and I couldn't  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:05):**  wait to share his insights with all of you.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:08):**  In this interview Tom talks about how he got started in water restoration and cleanup,  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:13):**  the biology behind how wetland plants and specifically their root systems help to filter  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:18):**  and absorb excessive nutrients and toxins from the water, and the ingenious floating  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:22):**  wetlands that he helped to design based on ancient indigenous systems that utilize natural  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:27):**  materials to create rafts that can be farmed.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:31):**  Tom also discusses some of the ways that all of us can get involved and start helping to  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:35):**  clean and manage the contamination levels in our own watershed.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:40):**  This is a really informative interview, so for those of you who are as excited about  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:44):**  the potential of regenerating damaged water systems with plants and natural materials,  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:49):**  grab your notebooks and I'll turn things over to Tom.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:52):**  Hey Tom, thank you so much for taking the time to be here today.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:55):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:56):**  I'm great thanks, yeah glad to be here Oliver.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:02:59):**  So you're calling in from Melbourne, Australia right?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:02):**  Yeah, yeah all the way over in Australia, you're in Guatemala so we're yeah connecting  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:08):**  across the globe.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:09):**  Exactly, we're about as far away as we possibly could be.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:12):**  Yeah it's great to connect though Oliver, thanks for yeah, thanks for connecting.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:16):**  Hey it's my pleasure, well I've got a ton of questions for you so what do you say we  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:20):**  just jump right on in?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:21):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:22):**  Alright, so before we get into the rest of the questions, could you give us a bit of  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:27):**  your background and how you came to work in water purification and cleaning?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:31):**  Yeah, so I got involved in water purification and cleaning as a result of, well I was studying  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:40):**  a Diploma of Conservation and Land Management and I was also studying permaculture.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:47):**  So I got involved in that and what led me to was a series of practical projects where  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:03:56):**  I needed to implement water quality improvement on my family's farm actually.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:04:03):**  We had a series of dams that channeled were getting eroded so that's how I first got involved  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:04:12):**  in water quality and aquatic restoration.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:04:15):**  It was then when I went to Ziri and met a guy called Professor George Chan and I did  
**[0:04:25-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:04:25):**  an internship there and got some training and then I ended up working for Ziri, Ziri  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:04:33):**  stands for Zero Emissions and Research Initiative and that was over in Europe and so that was  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:04:38):**  a period of six months which was just a great learning experience and Professor George Chan,  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:04:44):**  he was an environmental engineer for the government of Mauritius and he had been implementing  
**[0:04:51-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:04:51):**  water quality improvement works and projects for many years at that government level.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:01):**  He'd also then taken time out after he retired and gone back to China, went through our South  
**[0:05:09-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:09):**  East Asia to look at all the super high productive food producing systems and found that integrated  
**[0:05:19-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:19):**  farming systems were some of the most productive on earth and he found that actually there  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:28):**  was opportunity to grow rice on fish ponds as a result of there just being so much nutrient  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:34):**  in these fish ponds and integrated farming systems.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:37):**  It was actually required to put large scale aquaponics on the surface of these fish ponds  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:44):**  to keep them healthy, balanced and productive and so people were growing rice and cucumbers  
**[0:05:51-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:51):**  and all sorts of things on top of their fish ponds and so I learnt about all this in Professor  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:05:59):**  George Chan's book back in 2000 for him whilst I was at Ziri and yeah that led me on this  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:06):**  journey learning and understanding so I got started pretty much strapped that actually  
**[0:06:11-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:11):**  designing and building floating aquaponics systems and then in 2004 was involved in a  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:23):**  large scale floating aquaponics project in China.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:30):**  So yeah that's how it all got started.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:33):**  Fantastic, so let's take a step back a little bit.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:36):**  Could you tell us about the state of our current waterways around the world right now and what  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:40):**  has contributed to their degradation and in some extreme cases even the death of these  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:46):**  waterways?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:47):**  Yeah it's a really sad state of affairs.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:51):**  The global outlook for waterways and water bodies is very grim.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:06:59):**  The rate at which land has been cleared and converted to farming and in many cases factory  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:07:06):**  farming is the norm.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:07:10):**  We've just got a huge amount of run-up of sediment, nutrient, pollutants and then on  
**[0:07:15-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-tom-duncan/#t=0:07:15):**  top of that you have the industrial runoff.

**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:00:55):**  interview, just be sure to go back and listen to it if you haven't already.

**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:01:03):**  all that you need to know about sourcing plants and propagation material, and navigating the

**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:01:13):**  a whole lot more to it than most people are aware of. We also break down the practical  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:01:18):**  assessments of planning a profitable berry business, and how to design and plan your

**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:05):**  things over once again to Blake Cawthron.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:10):**  So with all of those considerations that we've gone through already, I feel like we've  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:14):**  jumped some of the steps that I know people are going to be interested in. So let's  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:18):**  take a couple of steps back and take a look at this from a planning perspective and where  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:24):**  to source your plants from. So this is clearly something that is close to your heart because  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:28):**  you also run a nursery to supply these things for growers and are very passionate about  
**[0:02:34-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:34):**  the quality and the raising methods of the plant material that you supply. Let's talk  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:42):**  about sourcing plants and navigating nurseries.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:46):**  Yeah, so sourcing plant material in the 21st century is very interesting because you have  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:02:53):**  more options than probably ever before. You can get plants from places like Amazon or  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:00):**  eBay. You can get plants and plant material from dozens of online nurseries. You might  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:07):**  have some local options. You might have some plants growing in your friend's backyard.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:12):**  So you've got a lot of different options out there and this is an important topic that  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:18):**  I talk about in the book also. Very, very important. And so you have to consider this.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:25):**  If you're doing this, if you're wanting to grow and produce plants and produce fruit  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:32):**  commercially or at a professional or semi-professional level, then you've got to be wise about it  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:39):**  and you've got to be professional about it. I can't think of a worse place to try to source  
**[0:03:44-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:44):**  plant material than eBay or Amazon because there's no accountability with the people  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:03:57):**  you're buying from. There's no credentials. You don't even get their name. You don't even  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:02):**  know anything about them and there's a lot of fake material. You can go on eBay and these  
**[0:04:08-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:08):**  other sites and you can find seeds for rainbow colored tomatoes or blue strawberries. Folks,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:16):**  these things don't really even exist. This is just someone selling something totally  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:20):**  fake. I don't even know why they let these people have these listings up. This stuff's  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:25):**  fake and so you should never get plants or plant material from there unless it's someone  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:31):**  selling on there that you're very, very confident in and have very good reason to be confident  
**[0:04:35-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:35):**  in. Online nurseries are all over the board. Some are total crap. Some are very, very high  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:43):**  quality. You're going to generally pay more for plants that way because you have to pay  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:49):**  for shipping. You have to pay for everything involved with that and that can increase your  
**[0:04:56-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:04:56):**  cost a little bit. You also have to consider bare root versus potted. A lot of people think  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:05):**  that they want a potted plant because they think it's going to be easier. They may have  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:09):**  heard some bad things about bare root plants or had someone that had a bad experience or  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:14):**  they read something online. I can tell you for a fact that most farmers out there, I  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:20):**  would go as far to say 95 plus percent when they're planting fruit plants, they're planting  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:26):**  bare root plants and they're doing it for very important reasons. First of all, let's  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:33):**  just look at those two options for a moment. You've got potted plants. What are they potted  
**[0:05:39-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:39):**  in? Potting soil which is basically peat moss and perlite and chemicals. Cool. That sounds  
**[0:05:47-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:47):**  like a great way to get it started, right? No. Bare root plants are generally field grown.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:05:55):**  They're grown in natural soil, in the earth, in a field. They're dug up by tractors and  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:02):**  machinery. All the soil is shaken off and washed off when the plants are dormant and  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:07):**  leafless and they're stored for a short time and then they're shipped to the final customer.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:13):**  They're going to have a natural root system. It's going to be generally big and robust  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:17):**  depending on the health of the soil, how well they're grown. They're going to have a nice  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:20):**  big healthy root system. All the transplanting and stuff that's done is done when they're  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:25):**  dormant so they suffer very little setback or damage from that. When you're growing plants  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:29):**  in pots, the plant is so constricted by the pot that it barely has room to grow. Most  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:37):**  people are feeding it chemicals in the peat moss and you're getting just a subpar stressed  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:44):**  out plant generally speaking. There's a few exceptions out there. For instance, something  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:49):**  like figs which are a product that we grow in our nursery and we ship and we grow in  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:06:55):**  potting soil in pots and ship out. Figs are so extremely fast growing. As soon as you  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:01):**  put them in the ground, they explode with so much growth that it doesn't really matter  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:05):**  if they're bare root or potted. Figs are an exception. Pawpaws are another exception.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:09):**  They don't handle field growing and digging up by machinery well. Their roots are very  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:14):**  delicate. Pawpaws are another exception. Blueberries can do well container grown and most blueberry  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:21):**  farmers out there are going to be buying potted blueberry plants when they put out. There  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:25):**  are a few exceptions but generally when you're talking most fruit trees, most berry plants,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:31):**  bare root is definitely the way to go. It's a more sustainable option. It doesn't involve  
**[0:07:36-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:36):**  plastic pots. It doesn't involve potting soil. It doesn't involve near as much irrigation.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:45):**  It doesn't involve the high shipping cost and fuel usage that shipping big heavy potted  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:50):**  plants does. A bare root apple tree weighs maybe a couple pounds at most. A potted apple  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:07:57):**  tree is going to weigh 15-20 pounds. Much bigger packaging involved so it's just lower  
**[0:08:03-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:08:03):**  resource. It's much more sustainable. We do both in our nursery by the way. Bare root  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:08:12):**  is really the way to go for most things. Another thing you got to consider too is that buying

**[0:16:45-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:16:45):**  Yeah, one other thing I want to mention quickly about the homework. So the homework, so to  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:16:53):**  speak, can seem a little daunting, but it's really not that complicated. Like let's say  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:16:58):**  you decide you want to grow strawberries, for instance. Okay, well first step, does  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:05):**  anybody grow strawberries in your area? Yes or no? If the answer is no, there's probably  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:09):**  a really good reason why and you should find out what that reason is. If the answer is  
**[0:17:14-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:14):**  yes, okay, then that means strawberries probably grow well in your area. Then you have to figure  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:22):**  out which cultivars grow well in your area. This is as simple as calling up the local  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:27):**  you-picks and other local farmers and saying, hey, what varieties of strawberries do you  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:33):**  grow? Or you may want to stop in their farm and pose as a customer or be a customer and  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:40):**  just say, hey, what varieties of strawberries are these you grow? Which ones do you like?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:44):**  I want to put some in my backyard, what would you recommend? That's a great place to start.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:49):**  So the Ag Extension Office, contact them. Hey, what strawberries do you recommend for  
**[0:17:56-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:17:56):**  Texas or Delaware or your country or whatever your area? Find out what that is. Then from  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:04):**  there, do a little more research in those varieties, see if they're appropriate for  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:07):**  organic agriculture, which I'm expecting most of the listeners here, that's the way they're  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:11):**  wanting to go. Because some conventional varieties may not do that well under organic production.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:18):**  So you want to figure that out. Then you just have to find a nursery that you can source  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:22):**  from. That's not that complicated either. We're talking all this work involved you could  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:27):**  do within a few days. It's really not that complicated. But you never want to just Google  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:33):**  search what strawberries grow best in Kentucky or what strawberries grow best in Texas or

**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:43):**  writing these articles, what their credentials are. That's not the place to start. So that's  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:50):**  the basic homework. Not that complicated. It's just a step by step process.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:54):**  All right, well, let's go back then to planting considerations. What do you want to know and  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:18:59):**  do ahead of time for the success of the plants that you're about to put in the ground?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:05):**  Yeah. So we touched on this a little bit earlier when we were talking about soil prep and everything.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:09):**  So basically, you just need to select a site that is practical and realistic for growing  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:16):**  fruit. So that means there's a few basic things that are pretty much non-negotiable. That  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:23):**  means it's very, very sunny. You need to have at least seven or eight hours of strong direct  
**[0:19:29-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:29):**  unimpeded sun. Direct sun means the sun is baking the ground, baking the area. There's  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:37):**  not big trees. There's not structures. There's not mountains or hills that are blocking the  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:42):**  sun. So you need minimum seven or eight hours of really strong sun. Better to have full  
**[0:19:46-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:46):**  day sun or almost full day sun, like 10, 12, 14 hours of sun best.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:19:54):**  Second, you have to have well draining soil. So the soil can't be marshy and wet. The first  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:02):**  site that we bought, which we're no longer on by the way, but the first site that we  
**[0:20:07-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:07):**  bought in Kentucky, about half the site is somewhat marshy. And I didn't know that going  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:16):**  into it. This is the first time I ever bought a piece of land and I didn't have much money  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:21):**  at the time. So I didn't have any options. And I chose a site that was not especially  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:28):**  well suited. About half of it wasn't well suited. The other upper portion actually worked  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:33):**  quite well. But a major portion of the land was just totally unsuitable to growing practically  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:40):**  anything except plants that can handle really, really wet conditions. So that was not good.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:48):**  So you want to make sure that the soil is well draining. And what that means is after  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:20:57):**  heavy rains, the soil drains and doesn't sit there wet and marshy and puddled. You shouldn't  
**[0:21:02-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:02):**  see any marsh or wetland type plants present such as cattails, rushes, reeds, different  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:11):**  types of algae growth and things that can grow on the ground in wet areas. You shouldn't  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:16):**  see anything like that at all. And you want to have a site that has a low water table.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:23):**  That means that when you dig down in the soil, you don't start hitting water six inches down  
**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:27):**  or foot down. Like this place was so wet that the water table was like six inches underground.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:35):**  And so it was a mountainous site. So the area that was good was actually well above that,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:42):**  but the lower area was marshy and wet. And so you want to check that out too. And that's  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:50):**  where you can also contact these different government offices and get their input on  
**[0:21:54-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:21:54):**  the site. You can also do what Stefan Subkowiak recommends and that's just get a post hole  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:03):**  digger which is a special type of shovel and just dig a big hole. And he advocates five  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:10):**  feet before you hit water for growing orchard crops. That's pretty deep. Not all areas are  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:18):**  going to have that, especially here in Kentucky. But even if you just have a few feet before  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:22):**  you hit water, that can work just fine for berry crops. They don't make super, super  
**[0:22:25-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:25):**  deep roots usually. But really the deeper the better to a point. And so you want to  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:33):**  check that out. You could also contact if there's well drillers and say, hey, I want  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:37):**  a well dug. How far is it before you hit water in this area? They'll give you a general idea.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:43):**  They might say, oh, it's generally 50 feet or it's generally 10 feet or whatever. They  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:47):**  can give you a general idea too. So that's an option. So you want to make sure it's well  
**[0:22:50-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:50):**  draining. It should not be in a frost pocket. So a frost pocket is an area where cold frosty  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:22:59):**  air blows and collects at the base of slopes, even small slopes, even slopes that are so  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:23:06):**  small you don't even notice they're hardly there. The cool frosty air will collect at  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:23:11):**  the base of that slope and it will get colder and more frosty in that area, which can be  
**[0:23:17-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:23:17):**  devastating to spring blooming plants like strawberries, most berries, most fruit trees.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:23:27):**  So that can be that if you plant in a frost pocket, you've already set yourself up for  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:23:34):**  failure right there. So that's an important thing to look for. And if you're searching  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:23:40):**  for land in wintertime, you can visit the site during different times of day and see  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:23:46):**  is this area frostier in the morning than this other area at night? Is it the first  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:23:53):**  part that gets frozen at night on a winter night? These are all things you can observe.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:00):**  And also land that is slightly sloped is generally better for fruit growing because it's going  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:04):**  to be better drained of both water and frosty cold air. So sloped ground is generally better  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:10):**  than a super flat site. The top of a hill or top of mountainous areas is usually not  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:17):**  ideal because the soil tends to be thinner and tends to be windier up there, all of which  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:23):**  can be problematic. So these are some practical considerations. Also, looking at soil types,  
**[0:24:31-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:31):**  you have options between areas that are very heavy clay or more loamy or more sandy. More  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:41):**  loamy soil, which is soil that's high in organic matter and well draining and usually has a  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:48):**  fair amount of clay in it, those soils are going to be better than really, really heavy  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:53):**  clay or soil that's almost like pure sand. So loam soil is going to be the best. Now  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:24:59):**  you may not have options in your region and maybe all clay or maybe all sand, those can  
**[0:25:03-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:25:03):**  work too. So that's the basic parameters for choosing if you have the option of choosing  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:25:12):**  your site. You can work around all those factors somewhat. Sunlight and soil drainage are the  
**[0:25:20-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:25:20):**  two that you have the least ability to change or alter. So those are basically it. If you  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:25:31):**  do have a site that gets very little sun, then you may just want to either grow on another  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:25:36):**  site or you may just want to look into a little bit of berry production and see what might

**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:25:50):**  at fruit production. So you got to be realistic too, unless you just want to experiment and  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:25:54):**  you have the time and money to do that.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:25:56):**  Well, so we've gone through almost all of the major practical considerations of evaluating  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:02):**  the site, looking at cultivars, sourcing the plants themselves, preparing for the planting.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:08):**  But at the end of the day, most people are going to want to have some sort of business  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:13):**  enterprise connected to this if they're doing it on any kind of major scale. If we're getting  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:17):**  beyond backyards and homesteads, oftentimes we're looking at how much this can produce  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:23):**  as far as income as well. And you've also written a lot in your book about the business  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:28):**  considerations of working with small fruit and have broken these down by cultivars as  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:33):**  well. But let's go over some of the patterns and the major considerations for how to make  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:39):**  this profitable.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:40):**  Yeah, that's something that many people are looking into these days. And first you have  
**[0:26:48-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:48):**  to look at what fruits are popular and good sellers in your region. It's going to vary.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:26:56):**  In Europe, blackcurrants, gooseberries, those things are really, really popular in a lot  
**[0:27:03-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:03):**  of areas like Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, places like that. Those fruits are really  
**[0:27:11-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:11):**  super popular and are going to be probably top notch sellers. Now you come to the US  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:18):**  and a lot of people don't even know what those are. And so like here in Kentucky, most people  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:22):**  don't really know what a blackcurrant is. And so if you show up at the farmers market  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:28):**  with crates of blackcurrants, you're probably going to hardly sell anything. And so the  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:34):**  first thing you should consider is not what you want to grow, but what do people want  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:39):**  to buy. And of course, we're talking about if you're wanting to sell. If you're not wanting  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:45):**  to sell, grow whatever you want. But if you're wanting to sell, you need to look at what  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:48):**  are people going to buy. And that means locally because these small fruits don't usually ship  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:54):**  very well. And I doubt most people listening to this podcast are looking to put in 50 acres  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:27:59):**  of raspberries and ship them 1000 miles away. Maybe you are. This may not be the right one  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:05):**  for you. But if you're wanting to do this on a small scale and sell locally, first you  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:13):**  got to see what sells. So go to local farmers market. What's really hot? What's moving off  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:18):**  the table the fastest? What are other growers doing? That's a good place to start. Like  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:23):**  if strawberries are really popular, you may want to grow strawberries. Now that being  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:29):**  said, is the market saturated? So is your local market, if there's 10 other growers  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:36):**  bringing in strawberries, that may not be the best option because you're going to have  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:42):**  to go against a lot of competition already. So like when we showed up at the farmers market,  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:47):**  there were people, a few growers selling strawberries, there probably could have been more, but there  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:51):**  was nobody with red raspberries. So we set up red raspberries, brought them to the market.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:28:56):**  I couldn't bring enough. There's one guy that show up every week and buy like $20 or $25  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:02):**  in red raspberries every single time we showed up. We ended up selling probably about $200  
**[0:29:09-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:09):**  in red raspberries like a week just off of a 100 foot planting, very small planting,  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:18):**  100 feet and only took a few hours to maintain and harvest and sort through all the fruit  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:24):**  each week. Maybe three or four hours or something like that brought in a couple of hundred bucks  
**[0:29:30-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:30):**  a week. Really, really worth it for us at the time. And so there's a few standard fruits,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:38):**  blueberries, raspberries, strawberries. Those are some of the most profitable and kind of  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:46):**  standard fruits. Blackberries can also be really popular, although for whatever reason  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:51):**  those blackberries always seem to be kind of a notch below the ones I just mentioned  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:29:56):**  in terms of popularity, although they've gained in popularity over time. Now if you're talking  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:02):**  more exotic things that people may not be used to, like let's say figs, of course in  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:08):**  Spain I'm sure figs are extremely popular. Everybody has them.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:11):**  Figs do just fine here. Yeah, no problem. But here in Kentucky, again in Kentucky a  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:16):**  lot of people don't even know what a fig is. Now if you go down to Florida, Mississippi,  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:21):**  Louisiana, Georgia, figs are more popular because they grow there. Here in Kentucky  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:25):**  they're not traditionally popular because they don't grow well here. Now if you're also  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:31):**  wanting to do something even more unusual like let's say Juneberries or some other exotic,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:38):**  more exotic type of fruit, that... Yeah, your hascaps, your service berries, your  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:44):**  Lincoln berries, yeah, yeah, yeah. The thing is there's a really wide variety out there  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:48):**  and it's a shame that more people don't know about them, but if nobody's going to buy them  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:52):**  at the end of the day it's not going to be a good enterprise.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:30:54):**  Yeah, now hascap or honey berry is really gaining in popularity in Canada and they're  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:01):**  a wonderful berry. We grow that. They're very, very nice fruit to grow, very, very tasty,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:07):**  easy to grow. However, like I said, you want to be sensitive to your local culture and  
**[0:31:13-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:13):**  the local preferences. You want to be realistic about that and that takes some observation  
**[0:31:21-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:21):**  and some research. That's the first step and then you have to understand is the market  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:29):**  saturated? If the market's saturated with strawberries you may want to look at is there  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:33):**  something very popular that not many growers are growing? Like let's say red raspberries.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:38):**  So then you can sort of create an estimate of, well, how many of these do I want to grow?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:46):**  How productive are they? How much do you get per foot of row of raspberries? How many feet  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:31:54):**  of row can I plant on my farm? How many can I handle to manage and maintain and harvest  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:01):**  and keep up on? There's factors like that and there's not always easy answers where  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:07):**  you can just do a Google search and it's going to be reliable because for instance, yield  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:14):**  per foot of row can vary all over the country. It can vary by soil type. It can vary by climate.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:20):**  It can vary by variety. One source might say one pound per foot of row. Another might say  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:26):**  three pounds. Another might say half a pound. It's really hard to know. There's a lot of  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:31):**  uncertainties that you're just going to have to kind of roll with. We started with about  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:38):**  a hundred feet of red raspberries. Maybe it was 150. It wasn't that much and that worked  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:45):**  out great for us. If we continued it on, I would have probably doubled that just to be  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:52):**  able to bring more berries to the market. Like I said, you may want to start off small  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:32:58):**  and then if hey, this is going great. This is no problem. I'm selling everything I can  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:03):**  pick. I could definitely handle more. Well, cool. Why don't I increase it by 25% or 50%  
**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:10):**  or double it and try that. It's a lot better to go that route than to plant way too much  
**[0:33:17-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:17):**  and be totally overwhelmed, especially if you're just starting out. Think small. If  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:26):**  you're just starting out and you have an idea in your mind, I'd probably cut it in half.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:32):**  Like if you think, oh, I think I can handle an acre of berries. Okay, I would really suggest  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:37):**  try a half an acre and see how that goes. If that's just super successful and great,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:45):**  then double it and see how that goes. But yeah, starting off small and practical is  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:52):**  always good. Like I said, there's always going to be some uncertainties in there because  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:33:56):**  you just don't really know how the fruits are exactly going to perform in your area  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:34:01):**  unless you have quite a bit of experience growing them. If you have a backyard scale  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:34:05):**  thing going, it's pretty easy to then estimate, okay, if I get five gallons a year off of  
**[0:34:12-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:34:12):**  20 feet of raspberries, then it's reasonable to think I could get 20 gallons if I quadrupled

**[0:34:32-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:34:32):**  how you're going to market these things. The very best route for most people in most situations  
**[0:34:39-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:34:39):**  as far as profitability is going to be direct sales. Direct sale means you hand the product  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:34:47):**  to the final customer, the final user. You're not going through a middleman such as a store,  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:34:53):**  a grocery, a restaurant, et cetera, a distributor. Direct sales are going to be by far the most  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:01):**  profitable route. What we were selling, red raspberries, we were selling half pint containers  
**[0:35:06-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:06):**  for $5 which is a good price and still today, that would still be a good price. If I was  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:15):**  selling those say to a restaurant, I'd probably get half that maybe, depends on the restaurant  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:23):**  and then you've got to deal with the restaurant which is not as easy as you might think and  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:28):**  I cover some reasons why in the book. If at all possible, if you have the time and inclination  
**[0:35:35-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:35):**  and you can direct sale, sell like through a farmer's market, that's a great option or  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:43):**  maybe you've got a friend that runs a farmer's market table and they can be the middleman  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:47):**  for you and you can work that out. Not everybody has the time to do a farmer's market table  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:52):**  or doesn't really like to deal with the public. It just depends on your inclination, your  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:35:57):**  personality, your time, your resources, you want to invest in it, how you're going to  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:01):**  market them but direct selling, you're always going to get the highest profit from that.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:07):**  If you're not able to do that for whatever reason, I would probably look at restaurants  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:11):**  next and also local grocery stores and local health food stores. I go into these local  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:18):**  health food stores in the city and there's like no local produce at all and I'm always  
**[0:36:24-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:24):**  just like, why? Why is there no one that's growing kale? Why is there no one that's growing  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:30):**  something really easy that they can sell at this local health food store? It's just interesting  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:37):**  to me that as many growers as you have and people wanting to grow, why is there no local  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:42):**  produce in the store? You may be able to strike a deal with them. Like I said, I was selling  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:48):**  also at the local health food store and once a week I drop off produce, greens, salad mix,  
**[0:36:54-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:36:54):**  red raspberries and it was really working out well for us. You also have to then have  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:37:02):**  packaging. You're not just going to hand them a big box of berries, you've got to have everything  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:37:08):**  packaged and the most common form of packaging is these little plastic clam shells, they're  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:37:15):**  called clam shells. Here in the US they're called that anyway. They're just like a little  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:37:19):**  clear plastic box that snaps together. There's various sizes, pines, half pines, quarts,  
**[0:37:26-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:37:26):**  maybe they're probably measured in different ways that have more sensible measuring options.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:37:37):**  So anyway, plastic of course is not ideal because it's a polluting product. Now it is  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:37:47):**  usually recyclable. Maybe there's some green options that you can, maybe there's biodegradable  
**[0:37:52-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:37:52):**  options or something out there these days. There's also when I was in Germany, they were  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:00):**  selling currents in these little, I don't know if they were like birch or something,  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:05):**  but there were these little wooden baskets.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:07):**  Oh, nice.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:09):**  Yeah, it was really nice. So there's options out there beyond plastic, but you're going  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:16):**  to have to have them in something professional and safe and clean and hygienic that's going  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:20):**  to protect the berries and get them home for the person in good shape. There's various  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:26):**  options you can look into and you can buy these things really cheaply if you buy a big  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:30):**  case of 500 of them or 1000 of them at a time. There's also little pulp containers that are  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:36):**  made of fiber.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:37):**  Yeah, like the egg cartons.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:40):**  Yeah, kind of like that. Yeah, and you'll see those at roadside stands. That might be  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:44):**  a good option. It's a little more eco-friendly too, probably. So there's different options,  
**[0:38:49-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:49):**  but you've got to have something to physically put the fruit in to get it to the end customer.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:55):**  So those are all some different factors that you have to really consider how you're going  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:38:59):**  to market it, pricing, and you want to be competitive with your pricing, but you want  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:04):**  to be realistic too. You got to be able to kind of match the grocery store, maybe go  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:10):**  a little higher. And once you build a clientele, like if you build a clientele of a couple  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:15):**  hundred customers that just love your product and become diehard about it, you may be able  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:20):**  to up the price a little bit, especially if your quality improves over time too. So you're  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:24):**  not always stuck in a price, but you've got to start somewhere and you can't be too stuck  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:29):**  on a price that no one's going to pay because if you're charging a price and you only get  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:36):**  10 customers to buy it, if you dropped it by a dollar and you get 50 customers, you're  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:41):**  probably going to make more money with that lower price. So these are all things that  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:45):**  you learn along the way as you do direct marketing.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:49):**  And there's a reason to start small and test and try a few things out, right? It's probably  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:39:55):**  going to take a little while to fine tune and dial in your little enterprise and all  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:01):**  of the little small changes that you would do with packaging, with marketing, with pricing.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:07):**  It's going to take a little while to do that. And if you're doing that with an initial investment  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:11):**  of a massive planting and you get something wrong, then the repercussions are going to  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:15):**  be that much more severe.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:17):**  Yeah. And it's good to start with a small diversity of things. Like you might figure  
**[0:40:24-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:24):**  out the two or three best, most viable products in your area. Like let's say that's grapes,  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:33):**  blueberries and red raspberries. Well then plant some of all three and then you can bring  
**[0:40:38-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:38):**  all three products and you can have a little bit of diversity to offer your customers.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:45):**  And then if one ends up just doing way better than the others, you might shrink the other  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:50):**  ones down a little bit or eliminate them or try something else new and see how that goes.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:40:56):**  So it's really good to start with at least say two, if not three different fruits you're  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:00):**  growing just to see like what do you like to grow? What really thrives? What are your  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:05):**  customers really like? What produces the best with the least amount of effort? And not just,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:12):**  you know, focus on one particular thing which may or may not end up panning out how you  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:17):**  want it to work.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:18):**  Yeah, when we talk about health and ecosystems through diversification, the same happens  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:23):**  with economic considerations, right? You don't want to put all your berries in one basket,  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:28):**  so to speak. And so I'm interested to get your opinion on staggering harvest in your  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:34):**  planting in that consideration because especially in temperate climates, we have a much shorter  
**[0:41:39-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:39):**  harvestable window when plants are producing. And if you've got things that all are maturing  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:46):**  and ready for harvest at the same time, let's say, you know, raspberries, strawberries,  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:51):**  everything kind of happening in early to mid summer, that can be pretty overwhelming. But  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:41:55):**  there are options depending on the cultivars and, you know, the diversity that you plan  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:01):**  in where things are maturing at different stages so that you've always got a product  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:06):**  going and you're not necessarily overwhelmed by having everything come in season all at  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:12):**  the same time. Have you managed to work that out on your own farm or do you simply bring  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:16):**  on the help necessary when it's high season?  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:20):**  Yeah, that's a really important consideration and there's some important consequences to  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:27):**  all that, like you said. So it really depends on what you're going for, you know, are you  
**[0:42:33-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:33):**  just doing this as a sideline, you know, profitable hobby sort of thing. Then you may just be

**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:45):**  them all over the course of a month and sell them and you're done and that works for you.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:49):**  Now, if you're wanting to do this, you know, more professionally or as a serious source  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:42:55):**  of income, obviously, you're going to want to have product for as long as possible. And  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:00):**  if that's the case, you know, I really recommend growing a diversity of things including some  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:05):**  amount of vegetables. Like let's say you just did berries, but then you also did salad greens  
**[0:43:12-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:12):**  or you also did kale or you also did tomatoes, which tomatoes are actually a berry and they're  
**[0:43:19-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:19):**  covered in the book also. And so you want to look at all your different, all your different,  
**[0:43:28-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:28):**  you want to have a range of harvest and as long as possible, like we're saying. So you  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:36):**  can stretch that out a number of ways like cultivars, like you said, you can have strawberries  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:40):**  that produce early season, mid season and late season. You can have blueberries that  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:45):**  produce early season, mid season, late season. And strawberries for instance are like one  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:49):**  of the very earliest fruits. Blueberries are kind of in the middle of the season and they  
**[0:43:54-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:43:54):**  can stretch into fall or late summer at least. And raspberries are actually a fairly late  
**[0:44:01-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:01):**  fruit and they come in usually mid late summer and can go all the way until frost. And so  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:09):**  there's two products right there. One is very early, one is in the middle, three products.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:14):**  One's very early, one's in the middle, one is late. And so that would give you a range  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:18):**  and you can also do the different cultivars to stretch it out as well. One of the consequences  
**[0:44:24-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:24):**  with that is that generally as a rule, fruits that are later producing tend to be more prone  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:35):**  to issues. Like for instance, a friend of mine is a grower, a very serious grower in  
**[0:44:42-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:42):**  Indiana and he says that the late strawberries are the most disease prone. And also there's  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:50):**  a, and that's a report of a lot of growers too, and then there's also a invasive fruit  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:44:56):**  fly that's in the United States now for the last say 15 years or maybe 20 years or so  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:03):**  called spotted wing drosophila. And it's probably in other areas now too. And it comes in in  
**[0:45:10-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:10):**  force during the later part of the season. And so the later fruits like blueberries,  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:18):**  it's been an issue with us with figs a little bit, raspberries, that fruit fly is going  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:23):**  to attack the berries that are the later producing ones. Whereas the early season fruits don't  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:28):**  have any issue with spotted wing drosophila at all, SWD. Whereas the later fruits, SWD  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:35):**  can be a pretty serious problem for some growers. It's gotten better in some years now that  
**[0:45:39-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:39):**  they're starting to balance out in some areas with predators now starting to feed on them  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:43):**  and everything. So that's good. But these invasive insects get worse as the season goes  
**[0:45:49-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:49):**  on also. Stink bugs, marmorated stink bug, et cetera. And so that's a consideration also.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:45:59):**  So sometimes the earlier fruits can be less prone to disease and insects just because  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:04):**  they finished their cycle before the insects are really their population's high or disease  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:09):**  pressure becomes high. So that's a factor too. But it's always recommended if you're  
**[0:46:15-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:15):**  wanting to maximize your season, then you're going to want to maximize the amount of seasonal  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:22):**  production that you have and you want to extend that through early, mid, late season varieties  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:29):**  and different species. And really diversifying too, like a lot of small fruit operations  
**[0:46:35-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:35):**  will also grow things like pumpkins that they can then sell in the fall or chrysanthemums  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:42):**  are really popular in the US in this region. And those, a lot of growers will produce that.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:48):**  A lot of small fruit growers do a lot besides just grow fruit. They'll also process the  
**[0:46:54-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:46:54):**  fruit into jams, jellies, ice cream, syrup, sauces. Maybe they'll dry some fruit. There's  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:03):**  different things that people will do, make pies with them. So I've seen a lot of small  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:08):**  operations that they'll then process fruit like fruit that doesn't sell or they have  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:12):**  an excess harvest. They'll process it and create a value added good. So that's another  
**[0:47:17-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:17):**  way of getting more value out of it. Another thing to consider is that a lot of these plants  
**[0:47:24-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:24):**  have valuable other products that you may be able to utilize. For instance, some plants  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:32):**  you may be able to sell cuttings, you may be able to sell roots. Red raspberries, an  
**[0:47:37-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:37):**  amazing medicinal herb, the leaves. And so that can be a valuable product as well. So  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:44):**  there's other ways that you can utilize these fruits beyond just the actual fruit that it  
**[0:47:49-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:47:49):**  produces. And maybe you can also have honeybees on site that are then helping pollinate the  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:00):**  crops and then you can also harvest a little bit of honey and sell that too. So there's  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:04):**  other options out there beyond just the fruit. Also agro tourism, if you have a nice attractive  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:10):**  site, this would be for bigger growers. This is obviously going to be beyond a backyard  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:15):**  or half acre scale. But if you scale up a little bit, agroforestry, you picks, all these  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:21):**  things can be really popular. There's other ways to create income. Some people like to  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:27):**  have weddings on farms, have your wedding at the berry farm. It sounds kind of sweet.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:34):**  And so there's other options out there beyond just you pick berries, you put them in a little  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:42):**  clam shell and you sell them at the market. So you have to kind of think beyond the box  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:46):**  too when you're doing all this and get creative with how you can create value beyond just  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:53):**  one single product off of this plant.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:48:55):**  Absolutely. And fortunately, there are increasingly innovative business models that you can look  
**[0:49:02-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:02):**  at to sort of model or try out different things that you can find all over the world. I mean,  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:08):**  I'm seeing subscription based citrus orchards down here in Spain is one that I hadn't seen  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:14):**  before where you can actually adopt a tree and they'll send you the harvest from that  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:19):**  tree over the years. And you kind of sponsor its maintenance and you get a share in its  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:24):**  harvest. There's new things coming up all the time. And I think there's tons of room  
**[0:49:29-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:29):**  for innovation as people start to value the experience aspect of coming out to these places  
**[0:49:36-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:36):**  and being a part of the process. And yeah, I think we're really at a renaissance time  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:43):**  right now for people who are interested in moving back into rural areas, starting farm  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:48):**  based enterprises, collaborating with existing farms and figuring out what their niche is  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:54):**  and how they can make their living and justify their time in it while producing high quality  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:49:59):**  food and appealing to a whole new type of customer that didn't used to value these things  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:04):**  until quite recently, actually. And so there's opportunity everywhere. I really like some  
**[0:50:09-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:09):**  of the examples that you've given and opportunities for bringing in specialty or artisan or adding  
**[0:50:16-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:16):**  extra value to things, extending the season, bringing in experiences, so many opportunities  
**[0:50:23-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:23):**  right now. Yeah, people have gotten really kind of burned out with the industrial model  
**[0:50:31-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:31):**  of you go to Costco or Walmart or whatever is in your area and you just buy some generic  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:38):**  food from some place and you don't know anything about any detail of it. People like stories.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:45):**  And so if your story is interesting, they're going to be attracted to buy from you. And  
**[0:50:51-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:51):**  people were attracted to our story of, well, here's a young, just married couple that moved  
**[0:50:58-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:50:58):**  from the city and moved to the mountains and started this operation. And now they have  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:51:04):**  this really high quality product and they'll deliver it right to your door. And they thought  
**[0:51:08-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:51:08):**  that was cool. And so they wanted to support us and they wanted to buy from us rather than  
**[0:51:13-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:51:13):**  go to the local Walmart and buy groceries. And so you want to create a nice story. You  
**[0:51:19-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:51:19):**  want to have a nice image with your product, a nice name to the farm that sounds good.

**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:51:30):**  you might have a great product, but if you're sitting there at your table and the table

**[0:51:49-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:51:49):**  to be adaptable to change. And that's what we did. Our operations always changing and

**[0:52:03-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:52:03):**  thing succeeds, it might become a major thing. If I get tired of doing it or it's just too  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:52:07):**  labor intensive, it doesn't bring in enough income, I phase it out. And so our business  
**[0:52:13-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:52:13):**  and our farm is constantly evolving. I've chainsawed entire groves of trees out after  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:52:20):**  they just didn't work and I just got tired of watching them fail and I planted something

**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:52:34):**  Canada, you got to keep your idealism but kind of put it in your back pocket. And you

**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:52:59):**  believe in and do something you feel really good about and you also have to make it practical

**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:53:15):**  or greens or tomatoes or some other product that's really easy to grow and profitable

**[0:53:25-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:53:25):**  the small fruits but maybe 20% of the production is vegetables or something along those lines,  
**[0:53:31-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:53:31):**  maybe 50%. And so you just have to be adaptable and that's what organic farming is all about.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:53:38):**  It's all about adapting to change and making something resilient that works for you, works

**[0:55:04-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:55:04):**  hope that people take that to heart as they're considering new enterprises on the land as

**[0:55:41-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:55:41):**  don't quit your day job just yet and just start small. If you're totally new to this,

**[0:56:15-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit-part-2/#t=0:56:15):**  out your local markets and just see what it is that works for you and your area and that

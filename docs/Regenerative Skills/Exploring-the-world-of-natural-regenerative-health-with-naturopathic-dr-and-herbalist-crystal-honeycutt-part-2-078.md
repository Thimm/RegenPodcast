**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:27):**  Welcome back to part 2 in our series speaking with Crystal Honeycutt about the idea of regenerative  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:32):**  health.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:33):**  Crystal is a naturopathic doctor and registered clinical herbalist who has been sharing incredible  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:38):**  insights on the topics of nutrition, self-assessment and diagnosis and how to find out just what  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:43):**  your body needs to maintain itself in top form.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:47):**  For more on Crystal's background and superhero origin story, you can listen to the beginning  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:51):**  of last week's episode.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:53):**  In this session, we'll pick up where we left off and start to explore the topics of supplementation  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:02:57):**  for faster recovery, the nuanced definition of regenerative health and how you can rise  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:02):**  above our low standards of health today to reach your superhuman potential.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:07):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:08):**  We were just talking about how some of these chronic issues can manifest from deeper seated  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:15):**  problems and like this persistent stress.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:18):**  And I know like so many other people listening today, myself included, have had some persistent  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:25):**  or chronic health issues that require kind of a more urgent attention than simple nutrition  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:30):**  alone can treat or at least is more urgent in the time frame.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:34):**  Now rather than reaching for the medicine cabinet or heading to the pharmacy, I know  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:39):**  there are a lot of other natural remedies, especially herbs that can act more quickly  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:44):**  and treat issues that can be hard to address with just diet alone.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:48):**  So my question is, what should more people know about herbal medicine and why might they  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:53):**  want to consider it over pharmaceuticals?  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:55):**  Nice.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:03:57):**  Thanks for asking that question.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:00):**  So the way that I like to think of it is foods and herbs are both botanicals.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:08):**  I mean the majority of our food are botanicals, right, excluding animal products.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:13):**  So they're all botanical medicine.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:16):**  However, I like to think of food as being our primary building blocks of our bodies  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:23):**  when we think about vitamins and minerals and certain macronutrients such as carbohydrates,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:31):**  fats, and proteins.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:34):**  Those are the things that we need to regenerate our body on a daily basis.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:39):**  They help to run our body and they help to regenerate our body.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:46):**  Herbs on the other hand or medicinal herbs are more like pharmaceutical medications than  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:53):**  they are like foods.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:04:55):**  And I know that that's tricky to say, so let me explain what I mean.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:01):**  Herbs for the most part have more specific and direct physiological actions than the  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:08):**  broad spread action of our dietary foods.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:15):**  So we can use herbs to help specifically direct biochemistry in the body to help it to retain  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:27):**  a certain level of normal functioning.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:31):**  I think a good example of this is the immune system.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:36):**  So with the common cold, traditional wisdom has us eating things like grandma's chicken  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:44):**  noodle soup and resting in bed.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:47):**  And our bodies generally tend to say, hey, I'm not very hungry.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:51):**  I don't really want to eat anything and I might want to take in a little bit of chicken  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:05:57):**  noodle soup if I'm not running a fever.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:04):**  But the rest of food doesn't sound very good and that's because your body has shifted gears.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:09):**  Right now it's not focused on building up, it's focused on fighting this viral infection  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:14):**  that's invaded your body.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:18):**  And we can talk about why you got sick in the first place, but that's another topic.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:24):**  We got to go way back for that.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:29):**  But what can help are herbs that help to boost your body's natural ability to fight off the  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:38):**  infection.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:40):**  So what these herbs are doing, there are certain phytochemicals within these herbs, let's say  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:45):**  echinacea is a really common one that helps amplify certain aspects of the immune system  
**[0:06:51-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:06:51):**  that are responsible for fighting infectious agents and also helping to modulate the inflammation  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:01):**  that actually comes out of fighting infection.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:04):**  So taking something like echinacea can help assist your body to overcome a virus in usually  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:14):**  a faster amount of time with less acute symptoms, the symptoms that make you feel like crap  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:20):**  basically.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:23):**  Why would we want to do that?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:25):**  Most people can overcome a cold.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:29):**  Most of us have immune systems that are able to encounter the rhinovirus and within five  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:35):**  to seven days we're pretty much back to normal.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:38):**  But that's if number one, we're hale and hearty before we get sick and it's just kind of a  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:43):**  fluke that we got sick and two, that we have the spaciousness and resources such as grandma's  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:50):**  chicken noodle soup to help us be in that process without getting any more depleted  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:56):**  than we already were to begin with.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:07:59):**  In the modern age, we really don't have that spaciousness and rarely do we have grandma's  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:05):**  chicken noodle soup at our doorstep.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:09):**  So if you're at the office and you've got the rhinovirus and everybody hates you for  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:14):**  being there because you're spreading all your germs, but at the same time your job feels  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:19):**  threatened if you're not sitting at your desk, something like echinacea can be very valuable  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:26):**  to boost your body's ability to recover faster and help you to overcome the infection with  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:33):**  minimal damage.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:36):**  So all of us have probably been in situations where we get a cold and we can't shake it.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:42):**  It lingers for 10 days or even two weeks or we get a cold and then right on top of that  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:47):**  we get sick again.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:49):**  And that really is because we haven't had the spaciousness and resources to help ourselves  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:08:55):**  recover from the first cold or to be able to overcome that virus altogether.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:01):**  And with our modern lives, we're taking the kids to school, we're running to the office,  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:07):**  we're feeling stressed out, we're staying up late, we're over consuming sugar, we're  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:12):**  doing all of those things that actually undermine our body's natural ability to recover.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:18):**  So I think that herbal therapies can be incredibly valuable to people at every age and stage  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:27):**  of their life because they're just like the extra oomph, they're the extra help.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:35):**  And it's kind of funny because I run into a lot of people through my work who are very  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:42):**  resistant even to taking supplements and taking herbs because they have this idea that they  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:49):**  need to do it themselves.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:51):**  Like I have to overcome this myself and it's some kind of like weird to your strength and  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:57):**  integrity as a human being.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:09:59):**  When in reality and social sciences have revealed this again and again and again is that human  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:05):**  beings need each other.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:07):**  We all need help.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:08):**  So sometimes our help comes through the botanical kingdom and there are these specialized phytochemicals  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:16):**  that can join up with our immune system or our endocrine system or our cardiovascular  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:21):**  system or whatever and make some magic happen and just get you over that hurdle without  
**[0:10:27-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:27):**  as much energy and resources expended because this energy and resources are your vitality.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:35):**  And this is a core concept within holistic medicine is our life forces is often described  
**[0:10:43-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:43):**  as vitality and things like chronic infection, chronic illness, overbearing stress, feeling  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:10:55):**  unsupported and disconnected from community and beyond it and feeling like you don't have  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:01):**  a purpose or a passion in your life.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:04):**  All of those things deplete vitality and a lot of the work that I end up doing with herbs  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:10):**  is helping to restore vitality in the body.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:13):**  In fact, we have this herbal medicine that could just completely go off on a tangent  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:18):**  here but I love myself.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:23):**  We have a classification of herb called adaptogens and what that means is they literally help  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:30):**  the body adapt to stress.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:33):**  And it's important to think about stress in that big picture fashion so we can have this  
**[0:11:39-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:39):**  chronic stress that really is killing us slowly ultimately but stress is a component of evolution.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:50):**  So we need to have some stress in our lives to help us evolve and help us adapt and there  
**[0:11:59-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:11:59):**  are certain herbs in all over the world whose core characteristics help us weird human beings  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:10):**  to adapt to life itself.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:15):**  So when we're looking at an environment that is becoming increasingly destabilized through  
**[0:12:24-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:24):**  global warming and other factors, the ability of our physical bodies to be able to adapt  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:34):**  to these changing environments is incredibly important for the survival of our species  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:40):**  as a whole.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:41):**  I mean just take that in for a second.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:44):**  So this is once again big picture.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:46):**  We literally have plants available to us and these are the hardy plants.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:53):**  These are the plants that grow at extreme altitudes and they grow in extreme environments  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:12:59):**  and they're hardy and they're ugly and they're tenacious and they taste terrible which is  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:06):**  an indication that they're good medicine.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:09):**  But these are the plants that have figured out how to survive.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:14):**  They are resilient and one of the most gracious things that I can imagine is that how these  
**[0:13:22-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:22):**  plants literally offer their life force to us to help us to become resilient and capable  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:31):**  of creative adaptation.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:35):**  I dispense more adaptogens out of my apothecary than any other herb because this is what human  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:42):**  beings need.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:44):**  We need fortitude to adapt to our changing environment so that we can evolve as a species.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:54):**  We need to be able to evolve at that micro level so within our own lives but we also  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:13:59):**  need to be able to evolve at that macro level which is in the much better scheme of the  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:05):**  evolution of nature in general.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:08):**  So these adaptogenic herbs and other herbs really provide very specific qualities to  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:19):**  our health and well-being and that is very different than what generalized nutrition  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:26):**  provides us.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:28):**  Now there's some herbs that we call nutritive herbs and stinging nettle is a very classic  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:33):**  example of that.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:35):**  These herbs are known to be more like superfoods.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:41):**  In South America, maca is a superfood and a clean herb but it imparts very specific  
**[0:14:51-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:14:51):**  and powerful phytonutrients that help to amplify our ability to be resilient within our own  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:00):**  environment and our circumstances.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:03):**  So to me that is the core differentiation between using diet to help you to be healthy  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:10):**  and then augmenting that with personalized herbal recommendations.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:16):**  That was a long answer.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:17):**  No, that was a fantastic answer.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:20):**  Just gives me a lot to think about.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:21):**  This is one of the reasons why I try and talk to you so often is because there's always  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:25):**  these nuggets of wisdom and new perspectives that really enrich the way that I see the  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:30):**  larger picture of health.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:32):**  Now I know that the term regenerative for it gets thrown around a lot for projects techniques  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:40):**  but regenerative health has been a well-known concept for a while now.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:44):**  So moving on from from how we can kind of use these different supplementations and herbs  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:49):**  and stuff to help us kind of catch up in order to bridge the gap between deficiencies in  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:55):**  the health that we're trying to achieve.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:15:57):**  Could you explain to us what regenerative health is and how it can be achieved holistically  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:03):**  and naturally rather than something that we're currently I mean obviously the far extreme  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:08):**  side of this would be things like steroids for people who are trying to gain strength  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:12):**  and muscle mass.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:15):**  How can we do this in a way that is you know really within the ethics of working within  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:20):**  the environmental limitations and the resources that we have at hand.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:25):**  I love all of your questions.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:27):**  They're really thought provoking for me too and I hope that this comes across as me sounding  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:32):**  like I know what I'm doing because I always have to pause here and go wow what a great  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:36):**  question what do I really think or feel about that.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:40):**  Well all of this comes from talking to you for many months now and the new perspectives  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:45):**  on these topics that you've given me and this is definitely where the inquiry comes from.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:50):**  So I really love the concept of regenerative health care or regenerative health but I think  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:16:57):**  it's important for us to take a step back for just a moment and understand that terminology  
**[0:17:04-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:04):**  through the lens of holistic medicine because really for me regenerative health is the balance  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:14):**  between growth and degeneration.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:19):**  It comes back to a principle in nature that we cannot escape which is the fact that we  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:29):**  grow we have life and then eventually we die and that death ends up.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:35):**  No no no you're not understanding me right Crystal I'm trying to get you to tell me how  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:38):**  I can live forever.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:41):**  I'm trying to help you to be comfortable with the fact that you're totally mortal.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:47):**  I refuse to accept that but go on.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:51):**  That's hilarious that is such a thing between us.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:55):**  But it's really important.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:17:59):**  I mean we can't have we cannot have a restoration of our soil without becoming accepting of  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:18:10):**  the process of degeneration and what that means.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:18:18):**  So I think when we're thinking and defining the concept of regenerative health we need  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:18:28):**  to strongly move away from this concept of being able to live forever.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:18:33):**  I think that's a real problem within human consciousness in general but it's particularly  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:18:40):**  important here because there is so far there is no mechanism that will keep a human being  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:18:47):**  alive forever and that's a really good thing.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:18:51):**  We already have a problem with overpopulation and so much of the problem that we have within  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:18:59):**  regenerative agricultural practices and systems has to do with the fact that human beings  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:06):**  as a whole have a really hard time letting go.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:10):**  We have a really hard time with our creation turning back into dust and especially at the  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:18):**  health level.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:20):**  Our modern health care system every single facet of it is designed to keep the human  
**[0:19:26-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:26):**  body alive no matter what and that often looks very mechanical and grotesque.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:34):**  And the reason that it is is because we have some innate challenge with true regeneration  
**[0:19:43-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:43):**  which is cyclical and nature teaches us that principle every single day in every single  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:53):**  way possible.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:19:55):**  Nature is always inviting us into this dance of growth and degeneration and that really  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:04):**  is what health is all about.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:07):**  When I think about my own health, when I think about the definition of health, when I think  
**[0:20:13-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:13):**  about the health of my clients, ultimately it's not to preserve their body forever especially  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:22):**  in some malformed state.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:28):**  It's truly alive to their fullest.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:32):**  No matter what that is, whether you are in a wheelchair the rest of your life, whether  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:38):**  you are a child that's only here for five years, God bless, it is part of life.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:46):**  And so I really don't think that we can have an intelligent conversation about regenerative  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:51):**  health without having that core principle at its center.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:20:58):**  Without accepting the full process.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:01):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:03):**  And if we can accept that full process then we truly can engage with the concept of regenerative  
**[0:21:12-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:12):**  health which means that my health inspires the health and well-being of another person  
**[0:21:22-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:22):**  which inspires the health and well-being of my community garden and the community garden  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:31):**  ends up supporting the health and well-being of not only a community but of birds and bees  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:38):**  and worms and this entire process.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:42):**  Regenerative health really is about a healthy ecosystem.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:46):**  So we're kind of coming full circle in our conversation here because we really can't  
**[0:21:52-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:21:52):**  discuss regenerative health and live from a regenerative health place without understanding,  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:02):**  sorry for the cliché, but the circle of life.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:06):**  And so I want my health.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:08):**  That's very Lion King, I agree with you.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:12):**  It's the earthy crunchy side of me coming out.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:15):**  I can't help it.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:16):**  Once again, it's all about balance.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:18):**  It's all about balance.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:24):**  And so when we're looking at the individual level, what regenerative health looks like,  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:33):**  that's when we take into that holistic picture.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:36):**  So how is my physical health and what are the factors that contribute to that and how  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:41):**  do I maintain that?  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:43):**  Because it's not a static position.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:45):**  Remember I said when human being becomes static, they get sick.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:50):**  So health is never a static place where you reach the top of the health mountain and you  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:57):**  stay there.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:22:58):**  That is completely unrealistic and I wish we would just throw that image out the door  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:03):**  because if I see somebody else climbing a mountain to promote a supplement, again, I'm  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:08):**  going to tear my hair out.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:10):**  That's not health care.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:11):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:12):**  Well, it's one of the things that we really echo within permaculture design too is that  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:19):**  what we're designing and what we're implementing is not a static system.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:23):**  Rather, it's a dynamic living one.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:25):**  And if you don't treat it through all the fluctuations and life cycles that it goes  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:29):**  through and recognize that you can't just implement it or plant it and then you're done,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:35):**  it takes a much more nuanced understanding of how to interact with those things and not  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:40):**  just implement them.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:41):**  It's really uncanny how they parallel each other.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:45):**  Health care or what I think should be health care and permaculture design.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:51):**  I know that we've talked about how permaculture design influences every aspect of our life  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:57):**  and I really believe that.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:23:58):**  I loved it when you handed me that vision because I said, oh wow, this is holistic medicine  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:04):**  in a nutshell.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:06):**  So absolutely, we've got what needs to happen to help hold the physiological body in balance  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:15):**  at the same time as it is being influenced by things like gravity and time and other  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:22):**  uncontrollable variables and forces, right?  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:25):**  Because we are all slowly…  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:27):**  I know, you're listing off all of the things that I just refuse to accept.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:30):**  It's okay, you're still young.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:32):**  You'll get there.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:33):**  Yep, it's true.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:34):**  And then looking at how those same principles apply to our being as in our mental state  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:49):**  and our emotional state and maybe our energetic state of being as well.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:24:54):**  So holistic medicine encompasses the mind, body, heart, soul, on and on and on.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:01):**  But those are kind of the core tenets.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:03):**  And then I like to think, okay, so I have a good sense of what my physiological needs  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:10):**  are but it's going to ebb and flow.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:12):**  I mean I'm going to hit a natural point in my life cycle where I'm in perimenopause  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:19):**  and that is not a disease state.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:23):**  It is a state of transformation.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:28):**  So everything might change and probably it will if you're headed into one of those  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:34):**  natural transition points within your life cycle.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:38):**  But another variable might be of, hey, you move to a whole different continent and you're  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:43):**  in a different time zone and a different weather system and you've got to figure out what  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:48):**  your body needs in order to stay balanced within that.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:52):**  So we're really looking – regenerative health is really about all of these intersecting  
**[0:25:58-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:25:58):**  circles that are constantly kind of ebbing and flowing and circling around each other  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:06):**  within this giant thing we call life.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:10):**  And then we get to a point where it's time to start really actively participating in  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:15):**  the degeneration process or i.e. the aging or dying process.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:21):**  And we have to get prepared to move into that place.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:25):**  I'm particularly fascinated with that.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:27):**  Once again, like I was saying, in modern health, we have a really hard time accepting death  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:34):**  as part of living.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:36):**  And so how do we return back to the soil in a way that supports regeneration, not only  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:43):**  supports the viability of our grandchildren but that of the entire planet and beyond.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:50):**  It seems like one of the bigger challenges behind that, or at least from my perspective,  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:54):**  is trying to remove your ego from it.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:26:57):**  It can be really hard on the idea or identity of self when you realize that it's temporary  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:04):**  and that the things you've done and the efforts you've made, the relationships and such, are  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:09):**  as temporary as your physical form.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:13):**  Even though things like memories and ideas and projects may endure past that, it can  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:18):**  be really hard to come to terms with just on an egoistic, individual level, don't you  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:23):**  think?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:24):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:25):**  I'm not trying to make this seem simplistic at all.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:26):**  It's very complicated.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:28):**  No, definitely not.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:31):**  And I would say too that there are cultures around the world that have just life vision  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:42):**  that promotes a more holistic way to live.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:47):**  And so those human beings have egos as we all do, but they also are able to be satisfied  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:27:58):**  within this natural law.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:04):**  And I think that the more we can make peace with our life and our environment and just  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:12):**  the fact that we are animals, we are part of nature just as much as anything else is,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:18):**  truly the better quality of life and the better state of health we're going to be able to  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:24):**  experience.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:25):**  Ultimately, if we can be strategic in our own lives where we are building, designing  
**[0:28:34-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:34):**  and creating structure within our own lives that can be flexible, that can grow with our  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:45):**  environment, we are ultimately participating in regenerative health.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:50):**  When we get stuck in building walls, when we get stuck in my way is the best way, when  
**[0:28:59-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:28:59):**  we get stuck in stubborn ideologies, everything begins to break down.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:08):**  Our physical bodies break down, our morality breaks down, and interestingly, creativity  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:18):**  dies.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:20):**  And I've been very fascinated with the concept of creativity as a quality that promotes health.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:30):**  One of these days I'm going to write a book on that and I've said it publicly now.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:35):**  I'm going to hold you to it.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:36):**  The concept, right?  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:39):**  I hope you do.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:41):**  The concept of creativity as a quality, I think it's an innate quality, but I also think  
**[0:29:48-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:48):**  it's something that we can cultivate, is a magic superpower that we don't utilize enough.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:29:57):**  And social science really is beginning to illuminate how incredibly important creativity  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:05):**  is when it comes to evolution.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:10):**  We know that it contributes to the evolution of ideas.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:14):**  It certainly has contributed to the evolution of technology and society, but when we bring  
**[0:30:21-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:21):**  it back down to the micro level or the physiological level, there's some really interesting data  
**[0:30:29-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:29):**  coming out about how a person who has a creative personality tends to be far more resilient  
**[0:30:37-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:37):**  to stress and they tend to have exponentially better quality of life.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:46):**  That is absolutely fascinating to me as a doctor.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:51):**  I'm fascinated by anything that amplifies quality of life and creativity is one of those  
**[0:30:59-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:30:59):**  core tenants that seems to be essential in crafting and the living of quality of life  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:10):**  for us.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:11):**  And it seems to be in such contrast to the way that the kind of conventional medical  
**[0:31:16-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:16):**  world is going in constantly striving for longevity and extending life without necessarily  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:24):**  making it worth living those extra years.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:27):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:28):**  I mean, you just encountered one of the biggest healthcare debates of the 20th century.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:38):**  And it's incredibly important, especially as we're looking at the baby boomer population  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:42):**  aging.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:43):**  I mean, this is the hot topic right now.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:47):**  And I think that it's helpful to all of us to be able to understand that there really  
**[0:31:57-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:31:57):**  are some core things that we can focus on such as cultivating our creative ability,  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:06):**  cultivating resilience.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:09):**  You know what's fascinating is that a person who has the qualities that are typical of  
**[0:32:15-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:15):**  what's considered to be a resilient personality, they have an ability to function outside of  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:26):**  what's called scarcity consciousness.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:30):**  And scarcity mindset or scarcity consciousness is something that actually goes beyond just  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:35):**  this kind of like new age metaphysical principles.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:42):**  It really is its own science.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:45):**  And there are neurological changes in the brain when someone is in what's called scarcity  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:51):**  mindset.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:52):**  And they literally have tunnel vision.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:54):**  Their thoughts become fixed.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:32:58):**  They're literally more prone to see quote unquote other.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:04):**  So when we're thinking about these huge international social issues such as racism and systemic  
**[0:33:11-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:11):**  suppression, people who are stuck in scarcity mindset are more likely to perpetuate concepts  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:21):**  of racism and discrimination than people who have managed to get themselves out of scarcity  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:26):**  mindset.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:28):**  And when you're outside of scarcity mindset, you're creative.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:33):**  You're a creator.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:34):**  You're an innovator.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:36):**  You're able to live outside of the box.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:42):**  And from that place, when we're looking at evolutionary strategy, you're ahead of the  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:48):**  game.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:50):**  That's really what evolution is all about.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:52):**  I mean, I can really attest to those things from my own perspective.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:33:58):**  That's been probably the biggest struggle in my journey as an entrepreneur is finding  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:02):**  a way to get, especially in the early days out of this mindset of scarcity, which kind  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:07):**  of breeds a continuation of that mindset.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:10):**  And as soon as you're able to get out of it, when the lack of stress stops hampering your  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:15):**  personal health and creativity starts to flow as a result.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:20):**  I mean, that's been one of the most profound realizations in this journey that I've had.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:24):**  And certainly your guidance has really helped me to identify it and to find ways of realizing  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:30):**  like, oh, maybe this isn't necessarily just coming from me directly.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:34):**  Perhaps it's just a shift of mindset that's required to realize the gifts and the abundance  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:39):**  that we do have all around us.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:42):**  That just as much, even from a selfish perspective of being able to recover your own best abilities  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:47):**  and tap into this concept of a higher self that is operating without the fear and the  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:34:54):**  limitation, that it's very easy to fall into, like I'm sure any other entrepreneur can relate  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:01):**  to this too, which just creates compounding limiting factors.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:06):**  Right.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:09):**  That's regenerative health right there.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:11):**  That was fantastic.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:15):**  We just identified it in a sentence.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:20):**  I really prefer your more nuanced approach to it, but you know, I'm a simple blunt tool,  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:25):**  so I have to simplify things.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:27):**  Yeah, no, it's that simple and it's that complex.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:33):**  It really is.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:34):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:35):**  It is both of those.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:37):**  It is, I mean, I think it's very illustrating of the human condition as a whole.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:43):**  I mean, we could spiral off into what is consciousness and all of that good stuff, but...  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:48):**  Oh, don't worry.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:49):**  I'll have you back on the podcast and we can go down the rabbit hole another time.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:53):**  Great.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:54):**  But yes, I think the concept of regenerative health is incredibly important, especially  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:35:59):**  as we're zooming into this modern era where we really do have, for the first time in history,  
**[0:36:06-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:06):**  we have significant things that we have to consider as an international population when  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:14):**  it comes down to the very literal survival of our species.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:18):**  I mean, we are all encountering an incredible shift in our weather patterns that's going  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:25):**  to absolutely impact every aspect of our living life that we know of.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:32):**  And we have concepts such as the ego now.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:36):**  I mean, that's only been around for 200 years.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:39):**  We have, or even less, we have concepts such as compassion that we're dealing with on an  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:46):**  international scale that we've never done before.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:49):**  There are so many ways that human life is expanding exponentially.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:36:56):**  And I think regeneration is truly at the heart of that, no matter what your particular area  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:01):**  of expertise and focus is, whether it's permaculture at the soil base, whether it's permaculture  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:08):**  designing your building, these incredible homes like you're doing, whether it's more  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:12):**  like my specialty is in healthcare, those types of things.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:16):**  We all need a global shift to embrace the concept of regeneration.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:23):**  And also realizing that each of those practices are connected, right?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:26):**  Oh, of course.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:27):**  Well, that's regeneration.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:29):**  There is a fundamental understanding within regeneration is that everything is interconnected  
**[0:37:37-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:37):**  and it needs to come out of the spiritual communities and it needs to move into the  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:45):**  practicalities of real life.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:47):**  Yeah, that's really well said.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:49):**  Now there's one more concept, which as soon as I asked this question, you're gonna be  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:53):**  like, yes, of course Oliver asked this.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:37:56):**  And that is once you've kind of reached this, this level of health that you're comfortable  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:01):**  with, you're feeling well, you're getting sick very infrequently.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:05):**  What's the next step?  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:06):**  Now, the way that I would phrase it is how do you go beyond that to sort of reach your  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:10):**  superhuman potential?  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:12):**  Because I feel like the definition of normal now has been degraded to sort of match what  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:18):**  the general population is going through and not at all representative of what the real  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:23):**  potential for human health can be.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:26):**  So let's explore that topic a little more and give people something to aspire to beyond  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:30):**  just not feeling terrible.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:33):**  Oh, that's so good.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:36):**  Wow.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:37):**  So, if you remember, I came to you with this when, when we were first talking, like, you  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:45):**  know, I had all of these digestive health issues that I really needed help with, but  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:49):**  even back then I was talking about like, how can we push it further?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:53):**  How can we, how can we reach this, this level of true potential?  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:38:57):**  And you had some amazing insights on this back then.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:00):**  I think that it comes down to when, when we're a healthy being, we're full of energy.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:11):**  We're constantly regenerating energy.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:15):**  We're putting off energy.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:17):**  So where, where do we want to focus that energy?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:22):**  I think is the next step and, and I'll put it in less abstract ways.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:28):**  You can have all of the money in the world, but it does not buy you happiness.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:35):**  Happiness and true satisfaction.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:37):**  So we're coming back to that sense of quality of life comes when we are able to help other  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:44):**  people.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:45):**  It, we really truly feel fulfilled when we are able to freely offer our energy in an  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:54):**  altruistic way.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:39:57):**  Human beings are only truly satisfied when we are able to give of our energy in an altruistic  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:03):**  way.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:04):**  And when we're healthy, we have an abundance of energy that allows us to do that.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:10):**  It allows us to give without resentment.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:13):**  It allows us to give without having demands on that energy.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:19):**  So it allows us to give without expectation.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:22):**  It allows us to be creative and, and envision a new future and it allows us to support the  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:30):**  vision of other people.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:34):**  That's truly living at the next level.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:37):**  When we're able to be self regenerating, we can participate in the regeneration of others  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:43):**  and in life itself.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:47):**  And that's really where the concept of living your passion and living your dream comes from.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:40:53):**  It comes from that place of being able to be self contained and then giving out beyond  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:02):**  yourself without expecting anything in return.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:06):**  And that actually is the definition of true empathy from Brene Brown's work is being able  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:15):**  to give without expecting anything in return.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:19):**  And I think this is really important.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:22):**  It's really important when we consider the common conflicts within our relationships.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:28):**  It's really important for anybody in any type of service industry.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:32):**  When we're looking at burnout, it's important when we look at elevating the quality of life  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:38):**  and other people and other cultures.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:41):**  It's really important when we're considering the future of humanity itself.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:46):**  But I think it's very challenging to operate from that place if you're not at a regenerative  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:53):**  state of health and well being.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:55):**  We have the instinct to do that.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:41:58):**  I think it is very instinctual for human beings to help each other.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:03):**  However, if we're not able to be in balance within all of that, then energy ends up getting  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:09):**  stolen and not returned.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:14):**  So if we can maintain a status of health that gives us extra energy, then our highest potential  
**[0:42:26-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:26):**  ends up being able to give energy freely.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:34):**  And that can look like whatever it looks like, whatever a passion is, whatever beauty is,  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:40):**  whatever love, however you can define love.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:44):**  I think it ultimately is sustained through that concept and that principle.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:50):**  Yeah, the beauty of the nuance of individual and different expressions of what that means  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:42:58):**  to each person is truly remarkable.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:01):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:04):**  It really is.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:05):**  And it's such an important concept and yet I think we have it really convoluted and knotted  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:12):**  up.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:15):**  And we have enormous amounts of burnout.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:17):**  We have people feeling underappreciated.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:19):**  We have chronic problems with not being able to connect well with other people.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:25):**  We're continually stripping resources out of the land and we don't know how to put back.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:30):**  Human beings are kind of a hot mess.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:36):**  I really do really love human beings.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:40):**  And as much as I love the plant world, I say I'm an odd herbalist because I love people  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:46):**  probably even more than I love plants and I'm able to see how plants give of themselves  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:53):**  so selfishly or selflessly, excuse me, to us.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:43:59):**  And I think that I look at them as our teachers and when we're able to achieve that place  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:07):**  of health and that's an individual thing.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:10):**  Once again, we're not talking about summiting a mountain.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:13):**  We're talking about quality of life that feels satisfactory.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:18):**  If we have an abundance of energy, then we can give and it might be a poem.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:23):**  It might be a prayer of gratitude.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:25):**  It might be a community garden.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:27):**  It might be international politics.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:31):**  I mean, who knows what it is?  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:33):**  But if you have the passion and the energy to go into that, then that is what creates  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:39):**  that deep, true sense of love and satisfaction.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:43):**  And that's what life is really all about.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:46):**  Wow.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:47):**  I think that's a perfect message to wrap up this session on.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:51):**  I am always impressed by the nuance and the wisdom that you approach health with and the  
**[0:44:56-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:44:56):**  holistic sort of criteria and very large overreaching look of consideration that goes into the informed  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:04):**  decisions that you make within your field.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:07):**  So Crystal, before I let you go here, can you let our listeners know how they can reach  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:12):**  out to you, how they can contact you and some of the services that you provide through your  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:16):**  company?  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:17):**  Oh, thank you.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:19):**  So I'm on social media just like anybody else.

**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:33):**  So I can be found on Facebook.

**[0:45:40-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:40):**  The website for that is www.balancedliving4u.com.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:45:54):**  And I can be reached personally through email at herbs, H-E-R-B-S, the number four and the  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:03):**  word hope herbsforhope at gmail.com.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:08):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:09):**  Well, thank you so much for taking the time today, Crystal.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:11):**  I'm sure we'll do a follow up soon because I always get so much out of these talks and  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:16):**  the insights that you give, especially on health, which is obviously an urgent issue  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:21):**  and has been with me for a long time, which is how we met.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:25):**  But yeah, I'd like to thank you again for the time that you spent with us today.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:29):**  And I'll be in touch with you again real soon.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:31):**  Oh, thank you so much, Oliver.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:33):**  It's always such a pleasure to get to hang out with you.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:36):**  I love the way that you make me think.

**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:40):**  And it's a real honor to get to talk with you about these things that I'm passionate  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:44):**  about and share them with your listeners.

**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-2/#t=0:46:49):**  All right.

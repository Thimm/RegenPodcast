**[0:00:10-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:10):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:12):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:16):**  I am once again honored to be representing my friends at New Society Publishers, the  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:21):**  book publishers that were a big inspiration to me even before I started working with ecologies  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:26):**  and natural buildings and way before podcasting.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:29):**  Their titles like The Natural Plaster Book and Timber Framing for the Rest of Us really  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:34):**  made me believe that I could build my own home, which I eventually did.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:38):**  And later volumes like Ecopreneuring, Unlearn Rewild, and Building Community have offered  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:43):**  tons of inspiration and even helped to shape my world view.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:47):**  Whether you're looking for practical tips on growing and preserving food, exploring  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:51):**  complex challenges in your own life, or sometimes just searching for hope and inspiration in  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:00:56):**  a crazy world where you don't feel like you fit in, you'll find exactly what you're  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:00):**  looking for and more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:03):**  Okay, welcome back everyone.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:07):**  Today I'm going to explore a topic that's been important to me for a very long time,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:11):**  but that hasn't been explored much on this show so far.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:13):**  And I'm talking about personal health and fitness.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:16):**  Now of course this is a very multifaceted subject and everyone's going to have their  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:20):**  own ideas of what diets, exercise plans, or mobility routines, as well as mental and spiritual  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:26):**  practices are essential, and that's great.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:28):**  But this interview is going to focus on physical fitness, and what it means to integrate exercise  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:33):**  and strength training into a holistic health plan that suits your own unique needs and  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:37):**  goals.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:38):**  For those of you who have been following this podcast since it was called Abundant Edge,  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:42):**  you'll likely remember me talking about my own struggles with digestive health, and how  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:46):**  I've had trouble for most of my adult life due to gut dysbiosis and some of the related  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:51):**  symptoms.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:52):**  In the past, when I've felt hopeless and that my nutritional health was way beyond  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:01:56):**  my control, I would focus on the areas that I could still influence.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:01):**  Since I was constantly traveling for most of the last 15 years, I focused on calisthenics  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:05):**  and bodyweight exercises that I didn't need any equipment for.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:09):**  And as I began to research how to train my body without gym equipment or weights, I quickly  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:14):**  found the inspirational work of Anthony Aravantakis, the founder of Bodyweight Muscle and the author  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:19):**  of many bodyweight training books.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:22):**  I was immediately drawn to his focus on whole body fitness and functional strength above  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:27):**  aesthetics, as well as his personal journey of transformation, which is truly heartwarming.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:33):**  Over the years, Anthony's exercise programs and online community have helped me to get  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:36):**  out of various depressive funks which have had transformative effects on my life beyond  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:42):**  just my physical fitness.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:43):**  The routines have helped me to manage my time better, gain motivation for other goals in  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:48):**  my life, and focus on holistic fitness.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:52):**  These qualities, while not unique to any one health program, have served as the spark to  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:02:56):**  recommit myself to many of the virtues that I hope to continue to improve upon and, one  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:01):**  day, even exemplify.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:04):**  Together they all tie into a much more complete and robust concept of holistic health as a  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:08):**  lifestyle rather than just an end goal.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:12):**  In this interview, Anthony shares his story of the accident that had him bedridden and  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:16):**  immobile for years, as well as the mind and body transformation that helped him to regain  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:21):**  control of his life.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:23):**  We talk about the mindset and discipline necessary for a holistically healthy life, and how to  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:29):**  look beyond your physical fitness to strive for optimal health in many aspects.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:34):**  Now I'm hoping that this will be the first of many conversations on these topics, and  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:38):**  I welcome you to suggest other experts and perspectives for future interviews on the  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:43):**  Discord channel, but for now, I'm pleased to get this discussion started with Anthony.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:48):**  So Anthony, you and I have been in touch for a couple of years now, and I've been following  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:52):**  through some of your workout programs.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:03:53):**  It was really the first exercise program that I stuck with for a lot of different reasons,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:00):**  but as I'm looking into increasing things like nutrition, lifestyle, health, and a lot  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:05):**  of these other emergent parts that have been instigated for me through workout programs  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:12):**  and developing that kind of discipline, making it into a lifestyle rather than just something  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:16):**  like a hobby that you do to feel better, I would love to talk about starting first with  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:23):**  your own journey into getting your health under control and recovering, because you  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:28):**  have quite a dramatic origin story, so to speak.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:31):**  You want to start with that?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:33):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:34):**  So thank you for having me in your podcast.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:37):**  And yeah, I had to summarize like a really long journey of getting out of shape and getting  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:45):**  back into shape.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:46):**  I would say it all started when I was 23.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:50):**  I had a motorcycle accident at the point I was finishing my university studies in sports  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:54):**  science, so I was working part time, delivering pizzas at the same time.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:00):**  And it was like an early spring night around 11 p.m., I think, when I was running through  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:09):**  this really dark alley.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:11):**  I noticed like this big bright lights coming close and closer and closer.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:17):**  And I just got in a big crash with a car with a swipe, basically the my bike.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:25):**  And I started just flying in thin air.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:28):**  I remember it like the whole flight being really cinematic.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:31):**  You know, everything went slow speed, slow motion.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:35):**  And yeah, I ended up on the pavement, 21 meters away, as I was informed later on.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:42):**  This is like like 80 feet, I think.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:46):**  And I noticed my leg was messed up.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:50):**  Yes.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:51):**  So sorry for the graphic scene, but my ankle was folded on top of my knee.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:57):**  And I realized that, OK, that's not a good sign.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:59):**  You know, at the moment, there wasn't any pain because you're you know, it's the whole  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:02):**  shock, the adrenaline and all that.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:04):**  But the pain definitely came a few seconds later.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:08):**  So to make a long story short, I was hospitalized for six weeks.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:12):**  I had seven operations where they were trying to save my leg.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:19):**  After that, I was for about two and a half years in Greece, in and out of hospitals,  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:25):**  trying to repair my leg.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:28):**  It wasn't working out well here in Greece.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:30):**  I left.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:31):**  I was in France, which is my second country, my mother's Dutch.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:34):**  We tried to repair the damage there as well.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:38):**  But in the end, it wasn't working out.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:39):**  So after a total of five and a half to close six years, I think we decided to have an amputation.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:49):**  For me, that last surgery was actually the easiest surgery because, you know, I finally  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:53):**  had a solution.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:54):**  Because when you're 23 and you're just like waiting for, you know, your health to for  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:01):**  your leg to be fixed, you can't do a lot of things.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:04):**  You know, you're pretty stuck.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:06):**  Your friends are moving on.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:07):**  They're finishing their studies.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:08):**  They're like starting businesses, families and stuff like that.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:12):**  And you're like just stuck.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:13):**  You know, you can't do anything, which was the hardest part for me.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:17):**  I was either recovering from a surgery or waiting for the next one.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:21):**  In total, I had 13 operations with the amputation being the last one.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:27):**  And after that, for me, the amputation was the easiest operation because I finally had  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:33):**  like a solution.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:34):**  You know, I knew that, OK, it's going to be like a hard road towards recovery.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:40):**  But at least I know, like I can get a prosthesis and I can be pretty active from, you know,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:45):**  what I can see other people doing.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:48):**  So it took me about a year to start learning to start walking on a prosthesis, you know,  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:07:54):**  to get at least towards the level where I could get relatively athletic.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:00):**  And now it's been how many years has it been now?  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:03):**  It's been eight years since the amputation.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:07):**  I think I'm in pretty good shape.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:09):**  You know, I can even outrun some of my most of my trainees.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:12):**  I would say that I trained here locally.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:16):**  And I do what I love.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:18):**  I'm a coach.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:19):**  I'm a bodyweight coach.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:20):**  I train people both online and offline.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:24):**  I've got my YouTube channel.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:26):**  I write books.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:27):**  I like writing books on this topic on bodyweight training, you know, how to make bodyweight  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:31):**  exercise, aka calisthenics, a way of living, how to make it basically part of your lifestyle,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:37):**  you know, and not just like something you do to get in shape for the summer or for a  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:42):**  wedding or for, I don't know, whatever, you know, goals people have sometimes and get  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:47):**  in shape, but they only fall out of shape afterwards.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:51):**  And yeah, I think in a nutshell, that would be pretty much it.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:08:55):**  So I'm curious because though we talked about the journey of eventually amputating your  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:01):**  leg from that accident on the motorcycle, that process took a real toll on your body  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:06):**  in other ways, too.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:07):**  And, you know, you started to lose your physical fitness all around your body as you were bedridden  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:13):**  in this process.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:14):**  Can you talk about what catalyzed in your mind that made you decide, okay, I'm going  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:19):**  to take this back into my own hands and get my fitness and my overall health under control?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:26):**  So I was used to being in pretty good shape most of my life.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:29):**  When I had my accident, I was competing in a kind of a kayak in Greece.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:34):**  We won a national championship the previous year.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:38):**  And when I had my accident, I was in really good shape.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:40):**  I would say one of the reasons that I didn't get any other injuries from what the doctors  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:45):**  told me was that, you know, my body was pretty strong.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:50):**  And that way, you know, I didn't sustain any other injuries from the fall.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:53):**  But after that, you know, six years not being able to train, you know, most of the times  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:00):**  I would be walking with crutches, motivation was super low.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:04):**  I was being depressed.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:07):**  I had periods that I was definitely depressed, that I couldn't train.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:11):**  You know, most of my life when I was stressed or angry or whatever, you know, when you're  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:16):**  a teenager growing up, when you got stuff like that going on, like my typical solution  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:21):**  would be to literally and metaphorically run away from my problems.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:25):**  You know, I just I would just hit the streets and run uphill and I get a really good workout  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:30):**  in and avoid my problems.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:32):**  But now I'm stuck in bed and I couldn't avoid my problems.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:36):**  And I didn't have the mental tools to deal with all that difficult situation.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:42):**  So I realized that in order to get back to basically because, you know, you're 27, you  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:50):**  haven't worked in years.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:53):**  Your confidence is low.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:55):**  You know, you have an amputated leg.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:57):**  You don't know how you're going to help people are going to take it.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:01):**  You know, like how relationships will be from this point on.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:06):**  I you're definitely at a point that, you know, your confidence is low.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:10):**  And so I decided that in order to boost my confidence, I will get back in great shape  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:16):**  again.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:17):**  I would I will eat healthy, but I will also take care of my spirit, which was something  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:22):**  that I didn't do prior to my accident.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:25):**  So I would also do things to build my mental toughness to, you know, I started reading  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:33):**  things regarding meditation, self-development, psychology, you know, anything I could read  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:40):**  in combination with nutrition and getting back in shape, you know, anything regarding  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:44):**  fitness.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:45):**  So it took me about, I would say, six months.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:49):**  But within six months, I got back in pretty good shape from being like completely skinny  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:57):**  fat, as they call it.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:58):**  And I would say that was my body type at the end of the accident because I wasn't eating  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:02):**  a lot.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:03):**  I was depressed and I didn't I had lost all of my muscle.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:08):**  So I started eating a little bit more, but definitely healthy.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:12):**  I started building muscle.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:14):**  I started developing myself mentally as well.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:18):**  And from that point on, things started to go uphill.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:22):**  And I found my confidence back, my mojo, as I call it, and things started looking better  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:30):**  and better.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:31):**  You know, of course, it's always a journey with a lot of ups and downs.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:35):**  But I would say overall, after the surgery, after my amputation was one, life only got  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:40):**  better and better.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:42):**  Well, let's talk about those ups and downs, because everybody, you know, nobody has like  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:47):**  a linear progression where it's all smooth sailing.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:50):**  It's always moving in a positive direction.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:52):**  And, you know, through some of your content, I've watched you go through a few of those  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:56):**  and I've related to some of my own.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:58):**  I know you've changed prosthetics that your previous one was not helpful or was causing  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:03):**  you pain and you've switched to that.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:05):**  And that caused you, you know, some bumps in the road and some dips in your progression.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:10):**  And I myself, as well as a lot of other people, especially during the pandemic, have gotten  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:14):**  out of some routines, have let themselves go.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:18):**  And what do you find helps you when you're in one of these slumps or starting to go in  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:25):**  a direction you're not hoping to get to?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:27):**  What helps to pull you out of that?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:30):**  And some of the techniques that you've seen help others as well.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:34):**  So like a lot of times, like in movies, you know, you only see like lows and highs and  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:39):**  you know, the hero just goes from being at a low ultimate low and just, you know, going  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:45):**  uphill and accomplishing stuff.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:47):**  But in real life, there are a lot of middle points, right?  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:51):**  There are a lot of in-between zones where you get stuck at a routine.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:55):**  You know, things are not getting better.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:13:58):**  You get bored and life feels a little bit slow, a little bit sticky, a little bit, you  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:06):**  know, I don't know that.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:09):**  You're not basically seeing any progress and you can get caught in a loop pretty often.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:14):**  What happened in the Netherlands, like during the first six months when I got in great shape,  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:19):**  I had all the time in the world.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:20):**  You know, I didn't, I wasn't working, you know, I still focus, I'm going to focus on  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:24):**  my health for six months, complete my recovery.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:26):**  And after that, I'm going to figure out what I'm going to do in terms of work.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:30):**  So I would train like two hours a day, you know, just take my time, have my workout routine  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:35):**  set up in a way that, you know, they took a lot of time, but I didn't care because I  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:40):**  had that time.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:42):**  And then I had, you know, to start working again.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:44):**  So I started having these jobs that were, some of them were quite stressful.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:50):**  You know, I was, I would work nine to five, nine to six, I would say, but on top of that,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:14:56):**  I would have to commute in total three hours a day.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:00):**  So you're, you're basically working more or less like 12 hours and you're coming back  
**[0:15:05-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:05):**  home and you're tired and you know, training for two hours is not practical.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:12):**  You know, you have to cook, you have to do groceries, you have to take care of paperwork  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:16):**  or whatever, you know, adult stuff you have to do.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:20):**  And that's the point that I realized that, okay, like this is not working, you know,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:24):**  in my head, I had to train at least one and a half hour a day, or I wasn't really training,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:29):**  you know, I was really black or white in my head.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:33):**  And that was the point that I started like getting stressed again.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:38):**  I didn't like the jobs that I was doing at that point that much.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:41):**  Boat with muscle was more of a hobby, of a side thing.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:46):**  You know, I was still figuring out how can I make this?  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:49):**  How can I make a living out of this?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:52):**  I had no idea about business, online businesses and stuff like that.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:57):**  So these were things that I had to figure out slowly because I also had to work like  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:02):**  12 hours a day at the same time.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:05):**  So you know, developing your own side business wasn't easy.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:08):**  And that's when I went back to the whiteboard and I started thinking, okay, you know, I  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:14):**  need to change things.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:15):**  I need to, what I did first, it was that I started training early in the morning, but  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:20):**  I was pretty rigid about it.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:22):**  I thought that I had to work out for one and a half hour, you know, like the rock does  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:29):**  or people, you know, Hollywood stars do.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:32):**  And you know, maybe for some people this works, but if you're already stressed, if you're  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:37):**  tired and you've got to wake up like 4 a.m. in the morning to train, you know, that's  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:43):**  probably not something that is practical for a lot of people and realistic.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:47):**  And you know, we do need to sleep.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:49):**  Sleep is healthy.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:50):**  You know, you got these YouTube motivational videos that are like, you know, sleep, I don't  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:54):**  need sleep, you know, quotes like that.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:57):**  But we know now from research on sleep science that one of the biggest reasons, one of the  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:04):**  biggest catalysts regarding health and autoimmune diseases and a bunch of other health problems  
**[0:17:11-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:11):**  is a lack of sleep.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:12):**  So definitely don't neglect your sleep.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:15):**  That's important.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:16):**  And at some point I realized that I wasn't having fun in the northern Europe.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:21):**  You know, I decided to come back in Greece, which was a positive change.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:27):**  But in order to do that, I would have to make my online business, you know, make me a living.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:33):**  So it got to a point that I could make a relatively decent leaving, at least for the place where  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:38):**  I live here, where costs are really low.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:40):**  So I came back to Greece, a really big step.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:43):**  I started coaching people also offline other than online.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:47):**  And the problem there began that, you know, although I thought that I'd be I'd have a  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:52):**  lot of more time here in Greece, where I live, it's a really small town, really slow paced  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:58):**  town.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:59):**  But I started getting more and more clients.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:01):**  And it got to a point that I was training so many and so much, so many people that I  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:06):**  didn't have time to train myself, which is, you know, it's stupid because you're a coach  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:10):**  and you should practice what you preach.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:13):**  And that's the moment I realized that, you know, I have to work out in the morning, because  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:19):**  otherwise I'll just keep postponing my sessions in order to train other people.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:23):**  But I also have to train more smart, you know, I need to figure out ways to train in a small  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:29):**  amount of time and make it effective.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:31):**  So that's when I developed some more high frequency calisthenic routines that were shorter.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:37):**  And turns out, you know, you can get in great shape even with short workouts if you're smart  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:41):**  about the way you train.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:43):**  And I would say that's the point where I started managing life, finding more balance and being  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:51):**  a lot more happy, you know.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:53):**  And after two years, I would say, it turned out that I was getting more stuff done in  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:59):**  less time.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:00):**  You know, I managed to be more productive by training smarter.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:03):**  And the funny thing is that, you know, I took a lot of principles from the way I started  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:08):**  my workouts and applied them also to the rest of my life business and everything.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:14):**  And you know, hard work is important, but smart work is also equally important, I would  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:19):**  say.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:20):**  Now, in terms of getting out of a slump, one of the things that helps me most is training  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:27):**  in the morning.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:28):**  Because when you train in the morning, you know, anytime you train during the day, you'll  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:31):**  feel good, you'll have that post workout feeling of euphoria.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:36):**  And everybody knows that, most people at least.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:39):**  But what happens when you train early in the morning is that you get to ride that wave  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:44):**  of euphoria during the whole day.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:46):**  So that was like a big thing for me, you know, training in the morning, you know, finishing  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:51):**  your workout before most people are still maybe even in bed.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:56):**  You know, you have this feeling that you're already like half of your day successful.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:01):**  You have this motivation that you know, I got that covered.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:05):**  You have that confidence boost from your workout.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:09):**  And you've got that momentum that carries over during the rest of the day.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:12):**  So working out in the morning for me, super helpful for getting out of a slump for getting  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:19):**  back into a groove and building up your your confidence, your your mood and everything.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:25):**  Yeah, I've definitely found that to be the case for me too.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:28):**  And one of the reasons why I got into your workout programs early on, I mean, we talked  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:33):**  when I lived back in Guatemala, and I was living more of a traveling lifestyle, the  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:39):**  inconsistencies and the variables of that lifestyle was often the the blame that I put  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:45):**  on not being able to get into a regular routine and hold on to it for any period of time.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:50):**  But I think one of the ways that your specific programs have taken away points of friction  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:55):**  are because you don't need equipment and you don't need to go to a gym to be able to do  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:00):**  this, which was for me extremely helpful.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:03):**  Not needing to have all of these things with you or having to go to another place helped  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:07):**  to remove a point of friction that would otherwise have kept me from getting these routines started.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:12):**  And also some of the clear start and finish dates of a few of the programs that you have  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:18):**  helped me to see it as, OK, this isn't a permanent forever thing.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:22):**  You know, I can just get through these couple of months.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:25):**  I can put some goals on there.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:27):**  And if there are big changes in my life or things aren't conducive to keeping it going,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:32):**  I can also stop it or take a break to.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:34):**  And being able to see that ahead gave me the confidence that I wasn't getting into more  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:39):**  that I could commit to.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:41):**  So those things were helpful as well.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:43):**  And now you are known mostly for the workout programs that you promote and the physiology  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:49):**  and and body weight training, of course.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:53):**  But I'm interested in your definition of holistic health and the other key disciplines or routines  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:00):**  that have helped you to feel better in lots of different aspects of your life.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:05):**  Yeah, so the things that have helped me holistically, I would say one thing is meditation, mindfulness,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:15):**  which it's not something that I always do, but I definitely reintroduce it during periods  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:22):**  that I need it.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:24):**  One thing that I find that works really well is placing meditation after a workout, because,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:31):**  you know, and especially after a morning workout, because after your workout, you've already  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:35):**  decompressed.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:36):**  You know, your your energy is more stable and your head is clearer.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:43):**  So it's sort of like a shortcut to getting faster, to a more mindful state.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:48):**  So combining meditation after a morning workout for me works miraculously.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:53):**  I would say like five minutes are enough after a workout when in order to reach that same,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:00):**  you know, spot of being mindful, calm and for depending on what type of meditation you're  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:06):**  doing that can vary in terms of, you know, what is the stage you want to reach?  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:09):**  But for me, just clearing my head and getting at a point where I'm peaceful, I have inner  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:16):**  peace usually would take about 15 to 20 minutes.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:21):**  But if I do it after a workout, it takes like three to five minutes, especially a morning  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:25):**  workout when your head is already pretty clear.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:28):**  So one thing is that another thing that is important is my morning ritual, you know,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:35):**  having enough time to wake up and just calmly prepare my morning coffee, sit down, write  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:42):**  my goals of the day on my notebook, plan the whole day.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:47):**  Super important as well.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:50):**  Having a hobby that is unrelated to work helped me a lot.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:55):**  The last two years I started playing the piano, which has been a really fun experience and  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:01):**  something that I find helped me a lot as well.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:05):**  Because, you know, sometimes I find that generally as a person, I like to see daily progress  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:10):**  in my life when I see like daily progress in any kind of area that helps me, it gives  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:17):**  me a positive boost, a mental boost.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:20):**  And you know, your business will won't always be going well, right?  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:24):**  Your workouts won't be always going well.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:28):**  But if you have like, three areas that you're that you had different in your life.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:33):**  So for me, that's business, that's exercise, you know, I like seeing progress in terms  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:39):**  of working out and all that.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:41):**  And my hobby, which is playing music, you know, even if two areas are doing really bad,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:46):**  like my business, let's say, working out, maybe I have an injury or whatever, even if  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:51):**  I have like a little bit of progress with my music practice, for some reason that makes  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:55):**  me happy, and it keeps me motivated to keep on going.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:00):**  And I think that's super essential for people, you know, having a little side hobby, something  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:04):**  you can do every day, that just gets you out of the rest of your life, you know, that out  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:11):**  of the other things that might be stressful.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:14):**  I think it's important that it's something you do with your hands, because I think that's  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:19):**  the way we're wired, you know, our brain detaches from stuff by doing manual work or work that  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:26):**  requires your limbs and some amount of dexterity.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:31):**  So playing music for me is also in a way a form of meditation as well, you know, for  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:37):**  20 minutes every day, that's the minimum amount I have, because I know that's realistic and  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:41):**  practical.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:42):**  And, you know, sometimes I'll have more time to for my hobby, but sometimes I'll have even  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:47):**  less.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:48):**  So I make sure that I get at least like 15 to 20 minutes minimum of practice.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:55):**  And that that has helped me a lot because, you know, up to two to three years ago, my  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:00):**  only daily focus would be like work and exercise.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:04):**  And exercise is also in a way part of my work of my job.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:07):**  So sometimes it's difficult to detach one from the other.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:13):**  So having a hobby, you know, something you do for yourself, I think really important,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:18):**  you know, you shouldn't be just trying, focusing on work and, you know, taking care of other  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:23):**  people, your family, you know, as much as you love them, you should have something that  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:27):**  you do that is more personal, a personal hobby.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:30):**  I find that to be essential for mental health as well.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:34):**  That's really interesting that you mentioned that right now, because that's one of the  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:37):**  things that I in just the last week have identified that is missing from my life at the moment.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:42):**  And one of the reasons why I actually find myself in a little bit of a slump, even though  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:46):**  I just finished the superhero workout program, it's often when you complete something large  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:53):**  and haven't planned the next thing yet.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:55):**  It's easy to drop off and not keep the momentum that you had from before.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:02):**  And you also mentioned, you know, the meditation, which fits into something that you've promoted  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:06):**  for a long time, the mind to muscle connection.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:09):**  And well, first of all, could you explain that slightly and talk about perhaps other  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:14):**  key understandings of physiology that were breakthrough discoveries for you as you learned  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:20):**  to optimize your health?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:24):**  So I would say the first year that I trained, you know, I was focused strictly on numbers,  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:29):**  you know, getting my ribs up and all that and sets and training volume.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:34):**  But I came to a point that I was pretty stuck in terms of progress.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:41):**  You know, I wasn't seeing any progress in the mirror, building more muscle and stuff  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:45):**  like that.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:46):**  So I was like, OK, I can either start doing weighted calisthenics, which is, you know,  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:52):**  in a way, also a little bit that carries over more to weight training than it is calisthenics.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:58):**  Not that I'm against it.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:00):**  You know, I do have a place for weighted calisthenics in my programing as well.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:04):**  But for me, it's essential that you can have a routine that doesn't require anything more  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:09):**  than I would say pull a bar or set of rings.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:12):**  So I was I started looking for more ways to make my workouts challenging.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:18):**  And I started noticing that one thing that was missing, not only from my workout, but  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:25):**  especially from a lot of other people's workouts was that mind to muscle connection.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:29):**  So basically feeling your body work while you're training, you know, feeling the muscles  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:35):**  that are the protagonist muscles, getting that muscle tension, you know, feeling that  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:41):**  muscle contraction.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:43):**  How much of a difference, first of all, that can make for people who are detached from  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:48):**  their bodies.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:49):**  I find that most people who haven't had an athletic background growing up are really  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:54):**  bad.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:55):**  You know, in quotes at mind to muscle connection, they just go through the motion.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:00):**  They don't connect with their bodies at all.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:04):**  And that's one of the reasons they are lacking progress.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:06):**  You know, I had a lot of people that were training, doing getting like a lot of reps,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:11):**  but weren't seeing any difference in building muscle.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:16):**  And I was pretty skeptical about it until one day.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:18):**  I remember I was training at this calisthenics park.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:21):**  And there was a guy who was doing like push ups.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:24):**  He was doing like 60 or 70 push ups and bam, bam, bam, like really fast, really limited  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:32):**  range of motion.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:33):**  And, you know, a little bit of bad form, typical mistakes like riding, rounding the shoulders  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:37):**  and stuff like that.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:39):**  And he came to me and, you know, I was doing 15 max 20 push ups back then, I would say,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:45):**  but I was working on the mind to muscle connection, you know, really slow, focused, contracting  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:50):**  my chest and all of that.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:52):**  And he would see me like do 20 push ups and be like dead after that, you know, I couldn't  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:57):**  get him another rep, but I had a pretty decent body in terms of muscle growth and all that.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:03):**  And he was like, how come am I skinny?  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:05):**  You know, he will, my Dutch wear wasn't that good.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:08):**  At that point, so we're communicating in like in bad mean, bad Dutch.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:12):**  And he was trying to talk to me in simple Dutch so I could figure out what he was saying.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:17):**  He couldn't speak English.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:18):**  So he what he asked me more or less was, you know, how come are you like, how come do you  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:25):**  have all this muscle growth?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:28):**  And I'm so skinny, although I can do like five times more reps than you.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:33):**  And I tried to explain to him that, you know, it's not just about the reps, it's about going  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:38):**  slow using clean form and really connecting to your body, you know, feeling that muscle  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:45):**  activation using my two muscle cues that help you make each rep more difficult, you know,  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:51):**  instead of trying to get more reps and make your reps easier, which is what most people  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:55):**  try to do.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:56):**  So I try to explain that to him.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:58):**  But I think that his ego was a little bit bigger and he didn't want to accept it.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:05):**  And he just went back to training the way he was training.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:08):**  So that was like a light bulb moment for me that I realized that, OK, people are getting  
**[0:31:13-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:13):**  reps and stuff, but they're not really focusing on that mind to muscle connection, which is  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:20):**  essential, because your body doesn't really understand reps, especially if they're really  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:25):**  bad in terms of form.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:26):**  What your body, first of all, understands is muscle tension.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:30):**  You know, that's how your muscles get stimulated in order to trigger hypertrophy and stuff  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:37):**  like that.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:38):**  So there was an aha moment.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:40):**  And that's when I started working on my two muscle cues.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:44):**  I started implementing them, first of all, in my practice and I started seeing progress  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:49):**  again.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:50):**  You know, I was pretty stuck for a while and suddenly I was building more muscle without  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:53):**  by actually doing less reps than I was doing previously.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:58):**  And the great thing was that a lot of people were getting great results.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:02):**  And I remember like a specific email, somebody sent me an email, I already remember this  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:07):**  and told me that, you know, I've been doing push ups for 10 years and it's the first time  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:10):**  that my chest is sore.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:13):**  So that was like a great moment in my training journey.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:17):**  And that's when I got really interested in my muscle connection.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:20):**  Back then, there wasn't a lot of research.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:22):**  It was the point where research was emerging on my muscle connection.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:26):**  You know, of course, you had like the old bodybuilding camp that believes a lot of muscle  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:32):**  mass, my muscle connection in the scientific community of fitness.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:36):**  Some people were supporting it, some not.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:40):**  But it's it's began to grow a lot and we have more and more research showing how important  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:46):**  it is actually.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:47):**  Yeah, it makes sense.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:48):**  And it was a real click for me to and I mean, it makes a lot of sense, right?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:53):**  You're focusing on quality over quantity, which has a lot of returns in so many aspects  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:58):**  of life, including fitness.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:00):**  And it also helped me to realize another thing that you talk about a lot, which is, you know,  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:05):**  training and workouts are great for overall strength, endurance, conditioning and things  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:09):**  like that.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:10):**  But a lot of people expect different results, not realizing that there's an 80 20 principle  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:14):**  that often comes along with diet and nutrition.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:17):**  If you're really looking for body composition and certainly something like aesthetics or  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:21):**  like many people are motivated to either lose or to gain weight, that really that comes  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:26):**  into play with how you're eating a lot more than how you're working out.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:30):**  You talk about that and how you have worked your own nutrition and diet into the plan  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:35):**  of your overall health.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:37):**  Yeah, because I mean, a lot of people might be in great shape and have like really strong  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:43):**  abdominals and a lot of muscle mass.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:46):**  But you know, if that muscle mass and your abs are covered by a lot of adipose tissue,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:51):**  you know, fat, basically, they're not going to show in the mirror.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:56):**  And you know, of course, training is not just about looking good in the mirror, but it is  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:03):**  a part for everybody.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:04):**  You know, we definitely like looking at progress in the mirror.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:07):**  And that helps with motivation as well, especially in the beginning, until you gain some momentum.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:12):**  And that is the reason that I recommend to people that, you know, you always start your  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:17):**  workout routine with a nutritional plan.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:21):**  And if you have a lot of body fat, especially if you're above 20%, definitely work on creating  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:27):**  a caloric deficit so you can start losing some fat.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:34):**  And as you get stronger, especially in the beginning, when you're a beginner, it's pretty  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:37):**  easy to build muscle and lose fat at the same time.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:43):**  So it is important to take advantage of that, you know, beginners, that beginners basically  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:51):**  physiology advanced that you have, the advantage that you have in order to build muscle while  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:56):**  losing fat.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:57):**  And, you know, that will also help you mentally to keep on going.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:01):**  Because if you're just neglecting nutrition, and you're just training a lot, and you see  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:05):**  no difference in the mirror, because you're just, it's just covered by fat, pretty fast  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:10):**  for most people that can be demotivating.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:12):**  But if you focus on the same time, nutrition, and you keep you start seeing results in the  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:16):**  mirror as well, you start losing fat, usually that is a lot more helpful in creating a sustainable  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:23):**  workout routine.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:24):**  Now, in terms of nutrition, first of all, you know, what is key is creating a caloric  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:30):**  deficit, it doesn't matter how healthy you eat, if you're on that caloric surplus, meaning  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:35):**  you're eating more than you're burning, you're never going to lose weight.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:40):**  Now, nutrition is a tricky subject, because people tend to get pretty extreme online about  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:49):**  it because there's there's so many different approaches that you can take.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:53):**  And I've definitely tried most of them, you know, I've tried being vegetarian, I've tried  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:58):**  fasting diets, I've tried paleo diets, I've tried food combining diets, I've tried, I  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:04):**  don't know, I think I've tried most of the popular approaches.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:08):**  And the way I see it nowadays, is that I like to study the the blue zones, you know, the  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:16):**  centurions, the people that live longer.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:18):**  So blue zones, for those who don't know, are parts of the world where people live the longest.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:25):**  And I like to see what are these people doing?  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:27):**  Now the thing is that in different blue zones, there's not like a standard way of eating  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:34):**  that seems to work, you know, it's not that all the centurions are mainly vegetarian,  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:38):**  or are mainly doing paleo, or are doing this type of workout routine.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:44):**  As a matter of fact, you know, in all of the blue zones, not all of them, but in most of  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:49):**  the blue zones, there are no gyms, which is interesting.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:53):**  And although, you know, people are in great shape, at least in terms of health, and leave  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:59):**  the longest.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:00):**  So what we do know from these people is that first of all, their life requires a lot of  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:07):**  manual labor on a daily basis.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:10):**  And even as they get old, because, you know, what happens in a lot of these places is that  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:15):**  you don't have running water, you know, you have to walk all the way to the well and get  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:19):**  it by yourself.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:21):**  In order to have food, you know, you have to take care of your own produce.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:26):**  So in one way or another, these places usually have a lifestyle that requires a lot of manual  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:33):**  labor.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:34):**  And people that eat less than they burn, like that's basically it, you know, people that  
**[0:37:39-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:39):**  eat less food, and in combination with manual labor, stay lean, as lean as possible until  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:47):**  they're as old, you know, as they can get.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:50):**  So that's definitely the key.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:52):**  One thing is, you know, staying lean, definitely a key for staying healthy.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:58):**  And we know from studying all the blue zones, you can do that with most diets, you know,  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:04):**  you can do that with a vegetarian diet, you can do that with a pilot diet, it doesn't  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:08):**  really matter as long as you are eating healthy and you have that caloric deficit.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:13):**  So my approach nowadays is that I eat a little bit of everything, you know, I try to keep  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:20):**  my protein high, because that keeps me satiated.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:23):**  And that also serves my muscle building goals.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:27):**  I don't track everything on a daily basis, you know, I think that is important for you  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:31):**  know, when I when I train people, for example, I will always get them started with tracking  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:37):**  everything for at least a week.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:39):**  So that way they can develop a nutritional consciousness, you know, they know that when  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:46):**  they're eating like a slice of bread with peanut butter, that's not 200 calories, you  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:51):**  know, that might be even 600 calories, if your idea of what a spoon of peanut butter  
**[0:38:56-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:56):**  is, is triple, then you know what the the real peanut butter spoon is, you know, because  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:03):**  some people will fill it up completely, and that can be 300 calories, and some people  
**[0:39:07-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:07):**  will just take a little like a really flat spoon, which is 80 calories or 90 calories.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:16):**  So sorry, so most people, for most people, what I do is I make them track everything  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:22):**  for at least a week, that way they create caloric consciousness, you know, they know  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:28):**  what they're eating on a daily basis, they know more or less how many calories they're  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:31):**  getting in. Most times people are pretty surprised by the amount of calories they get with a  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:36):**  lot of foods that are, you know, caloric bombs, as I call them.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:41):**  And this helps a lot in afterwards, just, you know, having enough knowledge to basically  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:48):**  eyeball your portions and know that, you know, like this amount of food is 400 calories,  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:54):**  it's not like 100 calories, as I might, as people might have thought previously. So I  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:00):**  always start with that, you know, track everything for at least a week. So you understand, you  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:04):**  know, what is the amount of calories you're getting in more or less on a daily basis.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:09):**  What I what I realized with this is that most people that are pretty thin and struggle to  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:14):**  gain weight are underestimating, sorry, are overestimating their caloric intake, and people  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:21):**  who are struggling to lose weight are usually underestimating it. And we've seen that in  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:27):**  research, even with people that are, you know, trained professional nutritionists, you know,  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:32):**  even these people can miscalculate their, their caloric intake if they're not tracking  
**[0:40:39-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:39):**  everything in detail. So, you know, definitely get started with that. Definitely focus on  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:45):**  keeping your protein high. That's because protein is one of the macronutrients that  
**[0:40:49-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:49):**  gives you the most satiation while also being the most metabolic active, metabolically active  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:57):**  macronutrients. So an easy way to explain this is that if you eat 100 calories of protein,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:03):**  your body is going to need three, sorry, 30 calories to burn that, to metabolize that.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:09):**  So no protein has 30%, requires 30% of your energy to break down that food, whereas carbs  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:17):**  need only 10, need 10%. So if you eat 100 calories of carbs, you're only going to spend  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:23):**  10 calories to burn your carbs. So keeping protein high for me is important, especially  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:29):**  if you're athletic, if you're training. A pretty common bias is that people think they  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:34):**  need less protein as they grow older, when the reality is that we know from recent analysis  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:39):**  that you need more. Each year after 30, you need to slightly increase your caloric intake.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:45):**  But of course you also have to decrease your calories a bit, but in terms of how much protein  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:53):**  you need, you need to slowly increase that as you age. That's another important thing.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:59):**  And other than that, just focus on minimally processed foods, go as organically as you  
**[0:42:06-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:06):**  can, biological foods, foods that are real. If it's in a plastic wrap and it's a, it's  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:15):**  square shaped or perfectly round shaped, you know, usually it's not real food. If it's  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:20):**  something that you can pick from the floor or from a tree or something you can kill,  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:26):**  sorry, vegans, by the way, then it is, you know, it's real food. So focus on real food,  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:33):**  focus on having a caloric deficit. If you want to lose weight or being at calorie maintenance,  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:38):**  you know, if you want to be steady or if you want to gain weight, do it slowly and always  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:44):**  do it in a combination with a strength training workout routine so you gain quality mass.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:51):**  I mean, I can talk for hours about nutrition, but maybe you should shoot some more questions  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:56):**  if you want me to be a bit more specific.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah, I know there's some really great stuff in there. I like how you mentioned the blue  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:01):**  zones as reference and that there is a lot of variation within the different areas around  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:06):**  the world, but there are also some recurring patterns that we can gather from, right? That  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:11):**  this is much more of a traditional lifestyle where people are active throughout their entire  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:16):**  life. And maybe it's not really intense bursts of like workouts, but they're always moving  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:21):**  around and there's always some sort of resistance, right? They're not just sitting on a couch  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:26):**  and then doing sprints or doing massive workouts. That's very uncommon in human history and  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:32):**  nature and the same with those takeaways from diet. Like it's mostly locally produced, fresh  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:38):**  food. Maybe it's vegetarian, maybe it includes some meat and the plants are very different  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:44):**  at different parts of the world, but there are commonalities that we can start to suss  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:47):**  out. And this has also been part of what we talked about before about getting back into  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:52):**  routines and seeing this as a longer term commitment to a lifestyle rather than just  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:57):**  a habit that you pick up or you give up for a while and the risk of going in these yo-yo  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:03):**  diets or patterns and applies to workouts as well. And I'm wondering how you see it  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:09):**  in your own mind as this is much more of a lifestyle for you. It's taken a huge transformation  
**[0:44:15-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:15):**  over the accident that you had reinventing yourself. Now this is part of your lifestyle  
**[0:44:22-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:22):**  in many other ways. It's a big part of your business and your work too. Can you talk about  
**[0:44:26-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:26):**  the mindset of seeing this in the long term and what helps you to reduce or avoid entirely  
**[0:44:32-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:32):**  these ebbs and flows that can disrupt regular progress?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:39):**  Yeah. So one of my favorite books on habit formation is by BJ Fogg. It's called Tiny  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:44):**  Habits and in the beginning of the book he says that in order to change, in order to  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:49):**  create a sustainable habit, this habit has to first of all make you feel good. Once you're  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:54):**  done with the habit, it should have some positive effects on you. So one of the key, that was  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:01):**  a really big light bulb moment for me when I read that book. As simple as it sounds,  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:06):**  your workouts shouldn't just be about improving your body, looking better in front of the  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:12):**  mirror. First of all, the first thing, the first essential thing should be that your  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:16):**  workouts make you feel good. They amplify your life. They're not something on your to-do  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:22):**  list that you have to do that feels so mandatory and so like homework, as I like to say.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:30):**  And that was like a big moment for me. I realized that my workouts should first of all make  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:36):**  me feel good. And that's what I focus on nowadays. I do them early in the morning because that's  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:42):**  the time of the day that I enjoy them the most and they're short and they're dynamic.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:47):**  And once I'm done, I have like a cold shower and I feel really good. I know that I'll be  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:54):**  a lot more energetic during the rest of the day. I know that I'll be, my head will be  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:59):**  a lot more focused. I'll be more calm. You know, when I don't train, especially for if  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:05):**  I do that for more than three days, I notice it, you know, my mood drops a little bit.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:10):**  I'm more aggressive. I would say, you know, I snap more easily and yeah, it definitely  
**[0:46:17-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:17):**  affects me mentally. So for me, like a short morning workout is the best dose of exercise  
**[0:46:25-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:25):**  and the way I enjoy training the most. I like doing it on a daily basis or three minimum  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:32):**  five days a week, five to six days a week, but I'll keep it short. And you know, that  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:38):**  way I get the most of it. I enjoy it. I'm not completely drained after the workout.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:43):**  You know, it's not that I'm dragging my feet and I'm tired. On the contrary, I'm more energized.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:51):**  And you know, when I see the effect that my workout has that way and the rest of my day,  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:55):**  how it makes me a better person, it makes me a better coach, a better businessman, a  
**[0:47:00-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:00):**  better boyfriend to my girlfriend, you know, and all these things. That's when exercise  
**[0:47:08-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:08):**  for me is really sustainable, you know, whereas if I had to do like two hours and, you know,  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:16):**  I would get bored at the end of the workout and I'd be trained for the rest of the day  
**[0:47:20-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:20):**  and it would be like strictly to accomplish this amount of goal, you know, gaining that  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:24):**  amount of muscle, it wouldn't be something sustainable anymore for me, for sure. So first  
**[0:47:29-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:29):**  of all, I focus when I coach people, for example, we sit and we talk and we say, okay, like,  
**[0:47:36-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:36):**  what is the best frequency for you? You know, what is the best amount of training that you  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:41):**  enjoy? How can we create a workout routine that leaves you happy? You know, that leaves  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:47):**  you that you do every day without feeling pressured and you enjoy and all of these things.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:53):**  So, you know, training frequency and training dosage is highly important. You know, you  
**[0:47:59-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:59):**  have to figure out what works best for you. Some people like training three times a week  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:03):**  and having something more dynamic. Other people training, prefer training on a daily basis.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:08):**  You know, they find that working out that way is more sustainable. And I think that  
**[0:48:12-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:12):**  for most people, that is true. You know, having like a daily routine, something you do almost  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:18):**  every day is more easy and more sustainable because it sort of becomes automatic, you  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:23):**  know, like brushing your teeth. You know, that's not something that you do some days  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:27):**  and won't do some days. You know, it's something that is standard, you know, every day in the  
**[0:48:32-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:32):**  morning I'll brush my teeth. So training, using a high frequency workout routine works  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:38):**  in the same way. And yeah, first of all, it should amplify your life. You know, it should  
**[0:48:43-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:43):**  give more value, it should improve all of the rest of the areas of your life that are  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:49):**  important. And when your workout does that for you is when your workout will be something  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:54):**  more easily sustainable.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:56):**  Yeah, and it seems like people come to this type of discipline from a lot of different  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:02):**  aspects with different goals and different desired outcomes, right? And it maybe isn't  
**[0:49:07-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:07):**  always a workout routine that they end up with. Maybe like you mentioned before, meditation  
**[0:49:12-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:12):**  or something more like yoga or stretching, and it could be an entirely different discipline,  
**[0:49:16-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:16):**  but it can often be the anchoring point. Like you said, that gives way to a lot of these  
**[0:49:24-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:24):**  other emergent benefits as you start to cultivate a practice of self care of whatever way, right?  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:32):**  Whichever way you're trying to improve in and wherever you're trying to get. But having  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:36):**  something that offers some routine, some consistency, but also a little bit of a challenge. And  
**[0:49:42-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:42):**  pushes you to continue to improve often has these run on effects for other aspects of  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:48):**  your life. And in talking about that, what advice would you give to people who are looking  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:53):**  to start to cultivate holistic health in their lives? So what are some of the entry points  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:59):**  and what are some of the things that beyond just workouts have really made a difference  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:04):**  in your feeling of well being and your interactions with the world outside as well?  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:09):**  Yeah. So first of all, when it comes to exercise, you know, when people ask me, what is the  
**[0:50:15-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:15):**  best body weight exercise? My typical answer is walking, which is not like that doesn't  
**[0:50:21-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:21):**  sound that sexy and amazing. But yeah, if you don't walk, even if you train, like you  
**[0:50:27-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:27):**  have a really dynamic workout in the morning and you do nothing the rest of the day, you  
**[0:50:31-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:31):**  just sit in an office, that's not going to be really effective. You know, that's going  
**[0:50:35-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:35):**  to be you'll still be unhealthy in the long run. And I've noticed this, you know, with  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:40):**  the current quarantine and all that, I would get my workout in the morning. And this year,  
**[0:50:45-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:45):**  I focused a lot on my online business. So I would sit a lot the rest during the rest  
**[0:50:49-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:49):**  of the day. And I realized that, you know, my metabolism is a little bit slower, like  
**[0:50:55-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:55):**  I'm getting more blurry in the abdominal area and my mood is not that good. And I realized  
**[0:51:02-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:02):**  that, you know, it's not just about training, you should move. And that's when I got like  
**[0:51:06-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:06):**  a smartwatch. And I had a goal of walking at least 12,000 steps a day. And that's not  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:16):**  including my workout. So when I work out, I actually take off my fit smartwatch. And  
**[0:51:21-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:21):**  I leave it on the side because, you know, I don't want to count my steps, you know,  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:24):**  I want to have my step goals separate from my workout goal. Because I know even if I  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:29):**  work out, if I don't walk, if I don't move, I'm not going to be healthy. So you know,  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:35):**  we are creatures that have to move, you know, you can sit all day in an office and expect  
**[0:51:40-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:40):**  to be healthy, both physically and mentally. So for me, walking is just essential, you  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:48):**  know, for anybody that wants to lose weight to be healthy. There's no way that you're  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:53):**  going to sit all day, even if you have a daily workout. If you don't move around, things  
**[0:51:59-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:59):**  are you're not going to be ultimately healthy. And I see that effect not only on the body,  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:07):**  as I said, but also mentally, you know, when I stick to my 12,000 steps a day, my mood  
**[0:52:13-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:13):**  is always a lot more stable, a lot more better. So definitely find a way to move on a daily  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:20):**  basis. You know, you don't have to do calisthenics like I do. I mean, I love calisthenics. It's  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:25):**  my way of living my, the most essential part of my fitness routine. But that doesn't mean  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:31):**  that it has to be for you as well. You know, even if you just walk and you watch your diet,  
**[0:52:36-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:36):**  you can be really healthy, you know, and grow old to be even a centurion maybe. But definitely  
**[0:52:44-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:44):**  find a form of movement that you enjoy and you find sustainable. So that would be tip  
**[0:52:50-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:50):**  number one. I'm not a big fan of activities that have you sit at. So for example, I'm  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:58):**  not a big fan of cycling. And I have a lot of friends that are professional cyclists  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:02):**  and stuff like that, and who get a little bit aggravated aggravated when I say that.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:07):**  But you know, when you spent the whole day sitting, and your exercise is also done in  
**[0:53:12-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:12):**  a seated position, you know, I think that's not good. And I can see that in people who  
**[0:53:17-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:17):**  do a lot of cycling with their lower back problems with their shoulder problems. So  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:22):**  I definitely find a form of movement that has you moving in a more upright position,  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:27):**  you know, that gets you out of that seated position, especially if you sit a lot during  
**[0:53:31-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:31):**  the day, and find a form of movement that you enjoy and you can do sustainably. So that's  
**[0:53:39-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:39):**  tip number one in terms of nutrition. Again, you know, find something that a diet that  
**[0:53:45-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:45):**  is as minimally processed as possible, find a way of eating that energizes you, you know,  
**[0:53:52-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:52):**  I find that some people do really well with vegetarian diets, other people need some meat,  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:57):**  I think that it's it's it really depends, you know, on the person on his DNA on what  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:02):**  his ancestors ate. You know, if you're like an Eskimo, who your parents, you know, your  
**[0:54:07-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:07):**  your line, your family line, always ate a lot of fat, you're probably going to need  
**[0:54:12-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:12):**  some fat, you know, you won't do well on a low fat diet. So experiment a little bit and  
**[0:54:18-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:18):**  see what works for you, what works best. And, you know, as long as your calories are in  
**[0:54:24-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:24):**  place, you're getting a decent amount of protein. And you find what works best for you, you'll  
**[0:54:30-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:30):**  be healthy. In terms of being mentally healthy, you know, of course, nutrition and exercise  
**[0:54:36-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:36):**  will support that a lot. But it's also about, for me, especially for men, you know, I mean,  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:45):**  probably for women as well, but I'm going to talk as a guy for men, I think we need  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:49):**  to have a mission in life, you know, because we're hunters, we're, you know, we're used  
**[0:54:55-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:55):**  to getting outside and, you know, having our sword or our bow or something and, you know,  
**[0:55:01-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:01):**  having a mission, I think that is essential. And finding a way to enjoy your work, you  
**[0:55:08-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:08):**  know, I'm not saying that everybody has to be like extremely passionate about his work.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:13):**  Now, I understand that some people can do that, you know, some people have families  
**[0:55:18-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:18):**  and might have to do a type of work that they they don't feel that this was, you know, what  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:25):**  they were meant for. But it's not always practical, you know, to just quit your job and go after  
**[0:55:30-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:30):**  your passion and stuff like that. But I do think that it is possible to learn to enjoy  
**[0:55:36-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:36):**  your work. You know, what I figured out was that the reason I didn't enjoy my work was  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:41):**  because I wasn't trying to be good at it. You know, once you go into this different  
**[0:55:46-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:46):**  mindset that I'll try to do my work in the best way possible, I find that you also start  
**[0:55:53-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:53):**  to enjoy work a lot more because, you know, if you're just hating your job and you're  
**[0:55:58-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:58):**  not trying to improve things, you don't have a goal. You just go to every day to the office  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:03):**  and it's boring and it doesn't give you this purpose. But when you try to do it, OK, how  
**[0:56:08-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:08):**  can I be the best at my job? You know, even if my job is, I don't know, as simple as like  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:16):**  working on a computer or cleaning streets or whatever, you know, I think that if you  
**[0:56:21-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:21):**  get in that mindset of, OK, how can I get as good as possible every day? How can I refine  
**[0:56:26-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:26):**  a little bit the way I do things? You know, how can I get better at these things? I think  
**[0:56:32-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:32):**  that's when even a job that you don't like can be a lot more enjoyable. So then we find  
**[0:56:37-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:37):**  a way to enjoy your work because it's something that takes like one third of your life. So  
**[0:56:42-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:42):**  if you hate it, you know, you I don't see a way that you can't end up being miserable.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:49):**  So find a way to enjoy your work and find something that you do for yourself. You know,  
**[0:56:54-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:54):**  find a hobby, even if that's 15 minutes per day. Find something that you do for yourself.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:00):**  Now, in terms of more spiritual stuff. For me, you know, it's been a lot of I started  
**[0:57:08-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:08):**  my since I was really young, I was pretty not a believer. You know, I was a pretty much  
**[0:57:18-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:18):**  an atheist growing up in a community, in a town where everybody was super Christian Orthodox.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:27):**  You know, it's funny, I was talking about this a few days with my mother when I was  
**[0:57:30-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:30):**  in when I was 10 or 11 years old. You know, I saw this documentary about the Big Bang  
**[0:57:36-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:36):**  Theory. And in school, we had a lot of classes about religion, which wasn't really religion.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:43):**  It was Christian Orthodox religion. And I one time I got up in the class and I said  
**[0:57:49-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:49):**  like, like, all this is false. You know, there is no God. And I believe that everything we  
**[0:57:55-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:55):**  know from science that everything started from the Big Bang. And I started seeing these  
**[0:57:59-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:59):**  things and, you know, seeing those things in 1993 in a super small town with teachers  
**[0:58:05-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:05):**  that were on average 60 years old and not believing in not being a Christian Orthodox  
**[0:58:11-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:11):**  wasn't even an option. I obviously got expelled from school. So I started my life being pretty  
**[0:58:18-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:18):**  much an atheist. And that's the the approach I took until I was 27 when I realized that,  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:26):**  you know, being absolutely, you know, knowing, saying that, you know, I know that there's  
**[0:58:31-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:31):**  nothing else. And, you know, we just come from nothing and go back to nothing. I think  
**[0:58:37-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:37):**  that is as fundamentalist as being like really rigidly believing in some whatever that belief  
**[0:58:45-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:45):**  might be, that belief system. I think it's we have to be open minded. I think we have  
**[0:58:50-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:50):**  to find a way to be spiritual in order to be happy in our lives. I'm not saying that  
**[0:58:56-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:56):**  you have to believe in this God or that religion or you don't even have to be religious, but  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:02):**  you do definitely have to find a spiritual system for yourself, you know, even if that's,  
**[0:59:08-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:08):**  you know, believing in the force of nature or, you know, it can be as Eastern as Taoism,  
**[0:59:15-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:15):**  which, you know, or other forms of Buddhism that don't are not even a theocentric system  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:24):**  belief. You know, you don't have to believe in a God. Just have a way, a system that,  
**[0:59:29-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:29):**  you know, gives you some spiritual support. I think that that is essential if you want  
**[0:59:35-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:35):**  to be happy, if you're just like, you know, I believe in nothing or I'm really rigid in  
**[0:59:40-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:40):**  believing having this faith. I think usually both of those roads lead to unhappiness. But  
**[0:59:49-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:49):**  I think that we definitely need to have a spiritual system to support us because, you  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:56):**  know, life will be pretty tough at times. And as strong as you think you are, life will  
**[1:00:01-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:01):**  find ways to break you down. And if you don't have at least some system of being a little  
**[1:00:09-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:09):**  bit more spiritual, it's going to be pretty hard to get out of that.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:16):**  Those are really interesting insights. And it I'm struck by how much it follows along  
**[1:00:20-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:20):**  with my own line of work, which is working with ecosystems and helping people to restore  
**[1:00:25-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:25):**  their health, regenerate to the potential of what those ecosystems can be. And if we  
**[1:00:31-1:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:31):**  look at the body as the ecosystem that it is a little bit more of on a micro scale,  
**[1:00:36-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:36):**  we do need to take care of it in multiple aspects in order for it to be healthy in all  
**[1:00:41-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:41):**  of the ways that it needs to to flourish. And as you were talking about with diets,  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:46):**  it's very context specific. Everybody's body is different. You're going to have different  
**[1:00:50-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:50):**  needs. And maybe your diet is informed by your moral compass and your bio region and  
**[1:00:57-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:57):**  the history and traditions that you come from. And you need to figure out what works for  
**[1:01:02-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:02):**  you. But you can still follow some guiding principles that are generally true. You know,  
**[1:01:07-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:07):**  you don't have to start from scratch, not eating too much processed food, making sure  
**[1:01:11-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:11):**  that your diet is clean and as fresh and local as possible. I mean, these have really been  
**[1:01:18-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:18):**  key to human development throughout all of our history and don't need to be reinvented  
**[1:01:22-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:22):**  just because we have access to different technologies and food from all over the place and from  
**[1:01:27-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:27):**  factories now. And it goes similarly with exercise routines. I mean, a lot of this is  
**[1:01:32-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:32):**  context specific, but there are some fundamental patterns that can be followed for generally  
**[1:01:37-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:37):**  good results and even into the spiritual and the mindset that you were talking about. And  
**[1:01:43-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:43):**  this is something that you can cultivate over time and is really key for a longer term of  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:48):**  approach. And it works very much like in my own line of work of developing ecosystems  
**[1:01:53-1:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:53):**  back to their full health. You can do some sort of large energy intensive and expensive  
**[1:01:58-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:58):**  interventions to get things kickstarted. But unless you see it as a long term maintenance  
**[1:02:03-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:02:03):**  and interaction of stewardship over time, it's not going to maintain the results you're  
**[1:02:09-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:02:09):**  looking for and it's not going to reach its full potential. And that is just as easily  
**[1:02:15-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:02:15):**  applied to our own physiology, our bodies as it is. Man, it's given me a lot to think  
**[1:02:22-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:02:22):**  about some great insights there. Can you tell our listeners where they can find more of

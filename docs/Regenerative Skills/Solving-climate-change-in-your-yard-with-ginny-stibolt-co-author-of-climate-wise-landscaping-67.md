### Regenerative Skills  (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:35):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:47):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:14):**  Climate change is becoming a major disruptor of ecosystems across the planet with disastrous  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:19):**  effects in many cases.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:21):**  For that reason, I spoke with Ginny Stillbolt, co-author of the book Climate-Wise Landscaping,  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:26):**  to learn about how we can transition our own lawn-centric and synthetic chemical-heavy  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:31):**  landscape maintenance practices into beautiful ecosystems that help to address the issues  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:36):**  of climate change.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:38):**  In this episode, Ginny talks in depth about alternatives to lawns and how adding native  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:43):**  species can bring beauty and health to your yard, while sequestering carbon in the soil  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:47):**  and attracting wildlife too.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:49):**  We talk about reducing the heat island effect in cities by planting appropriate trees and  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:53):**  creating water-permeable surfaces to reduce runoff.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:01:57):**  We also investigate options for growing food, cutting down on maintenance, and much much  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:01):**  more.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:02):**  We cover a lot in this short session, so grab your notebooks and I'll turn things over  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:06):**  to Ginny.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:07):**  Hey Ginny, thank you so much for taking the time to be with me today.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:11):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:12):**  I'm doing fine, Oliver.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:14):**  Thanks for asking me to be part of your podcast.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:16):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:18):**  Now, I just got finished reading your book and I have a ton of questions more relating  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:24):**  to how to make climate-wise decisions in your landscaping, and there are some neat things  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:30):**  that you sort of highlighted that I haven't actually seen addressed in most of the permaculture  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:35):**  forums and stuff.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:36):**  So what do you say we just get into the questions?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:39):**  I'd love to do that.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:40):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:41):**  So, why don't you get us started by talking a little bit about your background, how you  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:44):**  got involved in landscaping, and how you started to specifically look into how to make responsible  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:52):**  decisions for the climate with the landscapes that you got to interact with.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:02:57):**  Okay, well first of all, I'm a botanist and a backyard gardener.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:03):**  I'm really not a landscaper per se.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:07):**  So what happened was that I had, even though I had an advanced degree in botany, when I  
**[0:03:15-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:15):**  retired, well, I retired most of my professional career was in computers.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:23):**  So when I retired, I looked forward to gardening, but we moved from the mid-Atlantic region  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:29):**  to Florida.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:31):**  And even though we're in North Florida, where there are half a dozen killing frogs per year,  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:37):**  I was flummoxed by Florida gardening.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:42):**  And I had bought 64 tulips bulbs from a local store and planted them, but I got only one  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:51):**  leaf, and no tulips flowers at all.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:55):**  And that made me angry.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:03:57):**  So I started writing Adventures of a Transplanted Gardener for the Jacksonville newspaper.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:03):**  And so I began a writing career sort of by accident because I was angry that they were  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:10):**  selling us stuff that was guaranteed to fail.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:15):**  And so that's where I got started.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:17):**  And I then ended up meeting the editor for University Press of Florida, which is a press  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:25):**  for the University of Florida complex.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:30):**  And now I have four Florida gardening books.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:34):**  They've been peer-reviewed, so these are scientifically accurate books.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:40):**  But I started out with Sustainable Gardening for Florida, even though he'd asked me to  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:45):**  write an organic gardening book for Florida, because sustainable is so much more important.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:52):**  And that came out in 2009.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:04:58):**  After that was quite successful, he asked me, he said, well, what are you going to write  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:03):**  for us next, Jenny?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:04):**  I said, well, what do you think?  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:05):**  And he said, well, could you write an organic gardening book for Florida, which is exactly  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:10):**  what he asked me three years earlier.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:13):**  But this time I'd had more experience in Florida, and I'd also met an organic gardener in Miami,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:21):**  which is five planting zones south of us here in North Florida.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:26):**  So I did.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:27):**  The next one I wrote was Organic Methods for Vegetable Gardening in Florida, because in  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:33):**  Florida, because their soil never gets cold enough, which is why the tulips weren't successful,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:39):**  and the bugs never die, you really have to do things differently, and we can grow our  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:44):**  cool weather crops right through the winter.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:47):**  So things are definitely different here.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:51):**  And since she was in Miami, it really covered all of Florida, which was unusual.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:05:58):**  And because I'm a botanist, we arranged the vegetables by plant family and not by the  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:06:03):**  alphabet.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:06:04):**  So then I've written two more books on how to have a native Florida yard, and Sue Reed,  
**[0:06:14-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:06:14):**  who is my co-author on the Climate-Wise Landscaping book, is indeed a landscape architect in Massachusetts.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:06:26):**  So she asked me to be part of her book.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:06:30):**  My background is different than hers.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:06:33):**  So the landscaping part comes from her side of the knowledge base between the two of us.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:06:41):**  And really, I'm more of a botanist and science-oriented garden writer, and that's how I got into it.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:06:51):**  But it was an interesting adventure in researching all of the aspects and thinking about what  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:01):**  we can do as regular people to create a climate-wise landscape.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:06):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:07):**  So that's my long story.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:09):**  Well, like you said, there's so much diversity just in the state in which you live.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:14):**  And I mean, Florida in particular has been seeing a lot of the effects of climate change  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:19):**  just in the last couple of years with extreme storms, flooding and things like that.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:24):**  Why is this more important than ever?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:27):**  And what are some simple steps that people can make?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:30):**  Say they have a conventional, maybe suburban or urban lawn and are just growing grass at  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:37):**  the moment with chemicals and such.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:38):**  What are some of the simple steps that they can take to start to convert to something  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:43):**  that will have a better impact on their local ecology?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:46):**  Well, I'm glad you mentioned lawns because that is actually our first section in the  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:07:53):**  Climate-Wise Landscaping book because converting the lawns, even if you don't get rid of all  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:00):**  of your lawn, we would recommend that you replace your lawn at least a little by little  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:06):**  with butterfly gardens and groves of trees and other habitat.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:13):**  How you treat the lawn, you can do this right now and save money and just let your lawn  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:22):**  go.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:23):**  So some people call those lawns that are free from pesticides of all kinds and free from  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:31):**  fertilizers and free from over-irrigation.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:35):**  Some people call them freedom lawns.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:38):**  So you just mow what grows because once you start, once you stop with the herbicides,  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:45):**  then lots of other plants will grow and not just the grass.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:51):**  So that's the easiest, quickest, most significant thing you can do for the climate is to stop  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:08:57):**  treating your lawns with all those chemicals.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:01):**  And of course, everything's a chemical, but synthetic chemicals, so that would be all  
**[0:09:06-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:06):**  the poisons, the fungicides, the herbicides, the pesticides, the insecticides, all of those  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:14):**  are poisoning something.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:18):**  So we stop with those poisons.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:20):**  And when people spray your yard with that stuff, they have to put up a little sign that  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:27):**  said don't come into the yard for three days.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:29):**  Well, if it's poison to us and our kids and our pets, what is it doing to the butterflies  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:35):**  and birds who can't read the sign?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:39):**  So that's the easiest thing that we can do right now.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:44):**  Everybody can do that right now.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:46):**  And not only just people's home, not just homeowners, but community properties, churches,  
**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:09:54):**  school yards, all of those lawn areas can be converted right now today.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:02):**  I really am glad that you made the distinction between synthetic chemicals and chemicals  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:07):**  in general, because you can break down any natural material into a chemical and it's  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:12):**  important to know the difference.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:14):**  Now taking the next step, once you've allowed your lawn to go more natural and allowing  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:22):**  things that were previously considered weeds to survive, you can take a more active role  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:29):**  in which plants continue to grow and start to take over.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:33):**  So how do you start to select plants for the changing climactic conditions that are quickly  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:39):**  becoming an issue in a lot of growing zones?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:42):**  Yeah, well, if it's still a lawn area, you really don't have to do anything because if  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:50):**  you're mowing it, of course we should mow it less often, but if you're mowing whatever  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:10:55):**  is growing there, you really don't need to worry about the weeds.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:03):**  So that would be one thing, but if there's parts of your yard that you are converting  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:10):**  to something other than a lawn, then you do have to pay attention to known invasives.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:18):**  So that would be the first thing that you should be aware of is the plants that are  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:26):**  invasive for your area, and those need to be removed.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:31):**  So dealing with invasive species, because this is a problem everywhere in the world,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:35):**  especially with global transportation and species being constantly transported from  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:41):**  long distances, whereas they never used to before, how do you sort of manage that within  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:46):**  a healthy ecosystem so that you're not constantly fighting them back with either manual or machine  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:52):**  labor or resorting to chemicals in order to maintain at least a balance in the ecosystem  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:11:58):**  you're trying to cultivate?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:00):**  Well, I think that one of the things that bothers me most about, and Florida's got a  
**[0:12:07-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:07):**  really long list of invasive plants because everything grows here, the thing that bothers  
**[0:12:15-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:15):**  me is that invasives are still being sold in garden centers and big box stores.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:23):**  There's no laws against it.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:25):**  So when you see a known invasive that's for sale, like here in Florida, nandina or heavenly  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:35):**  bamboo, as it's called, is invasive in Florida, but you can still buy it.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:40):**  Mexican petunias, you can still buy those.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:44):**  So when you see those invasives for sale, I'd say, say something, say something to the  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:49):**  store and say, this is a known invasive you should not be selling.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:53):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:54):**  Could you start to go over some of the steps?  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:12:56):**  Because you had mentioned earlier that people are constantly over-watering along with the  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:01):**  chemical applications on these high maintenance lawns.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:05):**  So as you start to allow the native species to take over or possibly even propagating  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:10):**  things like food plants or other ornamentals, how do you start to make the steps to make  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:16):**  your landscape more drought tolerant, especially in certain areas of the country where drought  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:21):**  is a major factor of the climactic conditions?  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:24):**  Right.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:25):**  Now, we say in our book that if you live in an arid situation that you can't, and that  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:34):**  would be 20 inches or less of rainfall per year.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:41):**  If you live in an area like that, that no lawn is going to be sustainable.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:46):**  But if you live in an area where there is more than 20 inches of rain, then some kind  
**[0:13:52-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:52):**  of lawn could be maintained with the natural rainfall.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:13:59):**  And what will happen is that there's going to be some times of the year when the lawn  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:06):**  will go dormant.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:09):**  Like here in Florida, a lawn would normally go dormant in the winter.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:16):**  So we don't even mow our lawn from November to the end of March.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:22):**  So it just sort of goes slow.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:25):**  It slows down.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:26):**  And in other areas, the dormant time might be in the summer.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:31):**  So let the lawn go dormant.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:34):**  And don't overseed it, and don't keep watering it so that it has to be mowed over and over  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:42):**  again.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:43):**  So that does a couple of things, because if you're reducing the amount of mowing that  
**[0:14:48-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:48):**  you're doing, that's also climate wise, because a mower, most mowers are gasoline powered,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:14:59):**  so that if you can just reduce the amount of mowing that you're doing, then that by  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:05):**  itself is going to be a climate wise situation.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:08):**  So allow the lawn to go into its own natural cycles.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:17):**  And don't irrigate it at all.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:21):**  And yes, it will die back, and there's going to be bare spots, especially when you stop  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:26):**  treating it with all those poisons and synthetic fertilizers.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:31):**  When you stop, cold turkey, lawn is going to react, because the soil underneath that  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:37):**  lawn has been injured by all those poisons.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:41):**  So it's going to have dead spots, and it's going to end up not being that beautiful,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:50):**  green, lush, artificial lawn that it was.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:57):**  And pretty soon, though, other plants will come in.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:15:59):**  And it's not going to be necessarily all native plants to grow in.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:04):**  It could be plants like clover and other plants that take to mowing.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:13):**  For those of us who want to keep at least a portion of our lawn, say we've got kids  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:18):**  and they use it for playing, or we just want to maintain some of the aesthetics that we're  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:22):**  used to having, what are some things that we can do to enhance the edges around the  
**[0:16:27-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:27):**  lawn, which create biodiversity and much more resilience in the landscape, by giving biodiversity  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:35):**  not only in the plant life there, but attracting more native species, such as birds and insects  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:42):**  that do a lot of the work and the maintenance for us, ideally?  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:45):**  Well, that's right.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:47):**  So you would want to replace the lawn that you don't need with something else.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:16:54):**  And butterfly gardens would also attract not only the adult butterflies, but the larval  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:05):**  stages of the butterflies, which are the caterpillars.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:09):**  So you would want some milkweed for the monarchs.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:12):**  You would want passion vine for some other kinds of butterflies that need a specific  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:20):**  larval source, so that you would pay attention to what the butterflies need.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:27):**  And you'd have a wide variety of flower types so that you could attract a wide variety of  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:35):**  pollinators.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:37):**  And you would want to do that also near your edible garden so that you have pollinators  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:43):**  ready to go, so that when you're growing something in the squash family that absolutely needs  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:48):**  to be pollinated seven or eight times before squash will mature, then if you already have  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:17:55):**  a butterfly garden, then you've created a situation that's going to make your edible  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:02):**  garden more successful.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:05):**  Also on the edges of the lawns that are left, you'd want to make it easy to mow, so that  
**[0:18:11-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:11):**  you would have gradual curves, you would have a camp-down layer of mulch or even pavers  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:21):**  around the edge of the lawn.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:23):**  So when you do mow, you don't need other tools.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:26):**  You just mow once, and that's it.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:29):**  You don't need to go back with a string trimmer or some other piece of equipment to finish  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:36):**  off the job.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:37):**  So you'd want to create good mowable edges around your lawn, and no vertical edges near  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:45):**  the lawn.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:46):**  So if you have raised planters or some other vertical structure near your lawn, create  
**[0:18:55-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:18:55):**  a path or some kind of a mulched bed around that so that you don't have to come back with  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:03):**  a string trimmer to finish the mowing job.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:06):**  Yeah, I mean, if nothing else, it'll just cut down on the maintenance that you have  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:09):**  to do to maintain your landscape.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:11):**  Well, that's right.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:13):**  So you'd want to think ahead on the maintenance.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:15):**  And actually, one of my Florida gardening books is The Art of Maintaining a Florida  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:21):**  Native Landscape, because if you've got plants, they do, you know, in your landscape, they  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:27):**  do need to be maintained.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:29):**  Even if they're native plants, you still need to maintain them, because while you have a  
**[0:19:36-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:36):**  wilder, mostly wild landscape, it's still a landscape and not a totally wild area, or  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:46):**  at least most of it is.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:48):**  So the hand of the gardener is still there, but you'd want to sort of mimic what would  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:19:55):**  have been there before the development of your neighborhood took place.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:01):**  Certainly, and I would imagine that's different in every bioregion and growing climate around  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:06):**  the world, but certainly around the country and in all the diversity of growing regions  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:11):**  within your state.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:12):**  Leaving something alone and allowing the native species to take over will look different based  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:18):**  on where you are and the soil conditions, the microclimates on your space.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:24):**  And within those, you can kind of work with and manipulate the landscape to get what it  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:29):**  is you want, either aesthetically or through food production or any other number of ways  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:34):**  that you can maintain a landscape like that.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:37):**  Well that's right, and one of the things that makes me angry is that when you go into a  
**[0:20:48-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:48):**  big box store and most garden centers, what you see for sale there are annuals in full  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:20:57):**  bloom, and you are supposed to bring them home and plant them.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:02):**  But those plants, as far as those plants are concerned, they are finished.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:07):**  They have completed their life cycle because they have sprouted, they've grown, they've  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:13):**  developed flowers, and they go to seed, and that's the end of their life cycle.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:18):**  So when you bring those plants home and you put them in your garden to make a beautiful  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:23):**  garden, they're going to die.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:25):**  They're going to die either quickly or slowly, depending upon how you treat them, but those  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:30):**  plants that you see that are so beautiful on the shelves are not for the long term.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:37):**  And so when you are working on a more natural landscape, you want to, for the most part,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:45):**  ignore those flowers that look nice on the shelf of the garden center and create a more  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:21:54):**  long-term solution with native plants that might not be beautiful when you plant them,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:00):**  but they will be there for their full life cycle so that you don't have to replant, replant,  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:06):**  and replant.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:08):**  And when that happens, you also are going to be treating your soil better.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:14):**  And when you treat the soil better, the soil is a huge store of carbon dioxide, of carbon,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:22):**  is stored in our soil.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:25):**  On a global basis, the soil stores four times more carbon than all the terrestrial plants,  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:34):**  including the rainforests and everything else.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:36):**  The soil sequesters four times more carbon than the plants.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:41):**  So I just actually wrote an article saying, soil, we have to stop treating it like dirt.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:47):**  So we need to take care of that soil.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:50):**  Yeah, that's very well said.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:52):**  And for those people who are enticed by those flowers that you see in the big box stores,  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:22:57):**  you can save a ton of money by just buying the seeds, and then you can watch the plant  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:01):**  go through its full life cycle, bloom in your garden rather than buying it at the end of  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:07):**  its life cycle.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:08):**  And no matter how good of a gardener you are, you're just going to kind of watch it die  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:11):**  once it gets home.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:14):**  That's right.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:15):**  Or just use them for planters.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:17):**  So you have something showy right there, but you're not trying to do it in your whole garden.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:24):**  Right.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:25):**  You just have a planter on the porch or something.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:27):**  So you plant those beautiful flowering petunias or whatever in a planter, and then the next  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:35):**  season, you can put pansies or something in the planter.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:40):**  But you're not disturbing the soil with planting and replanting on a seasonal basis.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:46):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:47):**  And you've mentioned a couple of times the importance of soil health, not only for carbon  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:51):**  sequestration, but also for the health of your landscape.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:23:55):**  Can you talk to us about some of the tactics that you recommend for building soil in an  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:01):**  organic and in a healthy way?  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:05):**  Right.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:07):**  Well organic is a tricky word.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:10):**  And organic has a chemical definition, it has a edible garden definition.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:20):**  If you're an organic gardener, that's gone through certification.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:26):**  But anything that has been alive is organic, including some of the most harsh poisons.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:32):**  So just because something is organic doesn't mean that it can't be poisonous.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:40):**  So our original poisons are all organic.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:43):**  Of course the synthetic poisons are also poisons.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:48):**  But a poison is a poison, whether it's organic or synthetic.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:24:54):**  So we want to stay away from poisons even when there are pests.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:01):**  There are other ways to get rid of pests because what you want to do is to encourage the predators  
**[0:25:08-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:08):**  of those pests rather than to kill the pests because that poison cycle is onward and onward.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:16):**  So we need to escape from the poison cycle and use things like for aphids you just spray  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:22):**  them away with water for the time being.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:24):**  Don't use soap, don't use all this other stuff because if it kills the aphids it'll kill  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:29):**  the predators of the aphids.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:32):**  So escaping from the poison cycle is the best thing you can do.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:37):**  So when you do want to enrich the soil, don't try to change the acidity of the soil.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:46):**  So people say, oh, put in lime, it'll be less acidic.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:50):**  Just plant what belongs there and it'll be happy with the acidity of your natural environment  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:25:57):**  so that you're not trying to adjust the soil acidity because that's a never-ending battle  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:03):**  that you will never win.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:05):**  So plant the plants that are going to be happy in your soil no matter how lousy it is.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:13):**  However if you're going to...  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:14):**  Yeah, every time I hear that someone's got acidic soil, especially if it's in a northern  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:18):**  climate, I get really excited about the possibility of blueberries.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:23):**  And you can do it for edibles if you have a confined space, but to try to do lime for  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:35):**  a lawn and stuff like that, you're never going to win that battle.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:40):**  But if you do have blueberries, then you would want to use an acidic mulch, but you really  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:46):**  don't use that synthetic acid that is for sale.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:51):**  Just use whatever acidic mulch like oak leaves and pine needles and things like that so that  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:26:59):**  you can adjust the soil a tiny bit.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:03):**  The blueberries would be okay unless you have a really basic soil.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:07):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:08):**  Now we've covered quite a few things here and we're moving up towards landscaping for  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:14):**  disaster prevention.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:16):**  So now that we've got our personal ecosystems much more in line and much more resilient,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:21):**  how can we address things such as wildfires, floods, and some of the other disasters that  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:28):**  threaten our homes?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:30):**  You mean like hurricanes down here in Florida?  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:32):**  Well certainly where you are.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:33):**  Yeah, I'm here in Guatemala.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:35):**  So we just had a volcano.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:37):**  We're having ash rain down from the sky.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:40):**  That's a pretty severe situation.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:41):**  But yeah, hurricanes and a lot of the more common ones too.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:48):**  So there are a number of things that you can do.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:52):**  And if you are in a fire prone area, you are likely to know that.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:27:59):**  And that means that you would clear all the foundation plantings out because your plant  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:05):**  is growing under your eaves.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:07):**  So if a fire does come through, there won't be anything to burn within 30 feet of your  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:12):**  house.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:15):**  And you would not want to have a burnable fence that leads right up to your house because  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:19):**  that will act like a wick and will bring a wildfire right to your house.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:24):**  So you'd want a clear area around your house.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:28):**  At least 30 feet, a little more is probably better.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:32):**  And then the next zone out, you'd want to keep branches high and a little farther out.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:41):**  So that would help with the spreading of the wildfires right to your house.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:48):**  So there are definitely things that you can do to fight against that.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:52):**  And of course, because there's more drought with our climate change, that means there's  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:57):**  going to be more wildfires.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:28:59):**  And so there are things that we can do right now that would make our houses and our other  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:05):**  buildings more tolerant.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:08):**  There's no guarantees, of course, but will make it more likely that you'll survive that.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:14):**  Also, if you are doing plantings in your yard, we are going to have more severe weather with  
**[0:29:25-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:25):**  more high winds, more tornadic activity if you're not near a hurricane area.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:35):**  And you would want to plant your trees in groups or groves so that you have a whole  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:42):**  area that forms a thicket with shrubbery, ground covers, a number of different trees,  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:49):**  shrubs of different levels, so that when the wind hits it, it's not so vulnerable as a  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:55):**  standalone tree.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:29:57):**  And often the standard landscaping in neighborhoods is foundation shrubs that are going to outgrow  
**[0:30:06-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:06):**  your space and a single lawn tree that may or may not be appropriate.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:14):**  Here in Florida and in the southeast U.S., they often put beautiful magnolias.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:23):**  But if you put a magnolia in your yard, it has those great big leathery leaves that fall  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:30):**  down on your lawn all year round.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:33):**  So it creates a nightmare for maintenance.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:38):**  But what you would do to fight that is to build a thicket around it of shrubbery.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:45):**  Be very careful not to hurt the roots.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:47):**  But shrubbery all around, so when those darn leathery leaves fall down, they're falling  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:52):**  into the thicket and you don't have to pick them up off the lawn.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:57):**  Yeah, that's very important.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:30:59):**  So groupings is one way to have more wind tolerance.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:04):**  There's going to be more drought tolerance because when the plants are together, the  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:11):**  shade in the soil won't dry out so quickly and the roots work together.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:17):**  And we've recently found out that the plants actually communicate through their roots through  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:22):**  mycorrhizae, fungi, and stuff like that.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:25):**  And because the funguses are so important for the roots, the funguses are so important  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:31):**  for the roots, that's why the lawn chemicals that are fungicides are so bad for the soil  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:38):**  because in the area around a root, a plant root for whether it's a tree or a shrub or  
**[0:31:45-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:45):**  anything is called a rhizosphere, and when that root is there, then the fungi in the  
**[0:31:54-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:31:54):**  soil interact with the root and the tree can actually seep out some sugar to keep the fungus  
**[0:32:04-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:04):**  happy, but in turn then the fungus digests some of the soil so that the chemicals, the  
**[0:32:12-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:12):**  nutrients in the soil can be absorbed by the tree because the tree can't absorb the nutrients  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:20):**  in humus without the help of the fungi.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:23):**  So the fungi are extremely important for your plant health, which is why the lawn chemicals  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:29):**  are so darn bad.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:31):**  Certainly.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:32):**  Now, there are a couple of other things regarding, especially in urban areas, of ways to kind  
**[0:32:39-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:39):**  of create a more comfortable and conducive climate for humans, and that involves kind  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:47):**  of reversing the heat island effect, especially in cities, and finding alternatives for sort  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:53):**  of climate-wise driveways and parking.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:32:56):**  Could you talk about those two things and some simple steps that you could do to help  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:00):**  reverse the heat island effect?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:04):**  Plant more trees.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:07):**  The trees are so important, and even a few new trees will add to the global population  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:14):**  of the trees so that the trees extract water from the soil and put it into the atmosphere,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:22):**  and because we are losing our forests, what happens is that the atmosphere doesn't have  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:27):**  as much moisture as it did, which is why we're having more droughts.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:30):**  So we need more trees.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:33):**  When you plant trees in a city, you have to be careful that the tree is not going to outgrow  
**[0:33:39-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:39):**  the space, and that you give it enough room for the roots so that the roots of the tree  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:47):**  are not lifting the sidewalks and that kind of thing, so that you need to have porous  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:53):**  covers for the roots so people are not walking on them, and you need to probably have some  
**[0:33:59-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:33:59):**  way of irrigating the trees more ecologically.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:08):**  Sound ways of doing that is by putting in curb cuts, so you're actually creating a rain  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:14):**  garden in the cities, and you're planting the trees that could live in a rain garden  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:21):**  kind of environment where sometimes it's flooded, sometimes it's dry.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:26):**  But then the water from the roads goes into the rain garden where the trees are and other  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:33):**  plants are, and then the water, instead of going into the storm system, the storm drain  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:39):**  system, will get absorbed by those plants or soak into the ground to replenish our aquifers,  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:46):**  so that planting more trees is important, but it is restricted in a city because of  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:53):**  the room.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:55):**  So you have to be careful in choosing a tree.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:34:58):**  So certainly in a city, we have these tremendously large live oaks down here in southeast Florida,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:06):**  I mean southeast US.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:08):**  They're huge.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:09):**  So you would never plant that tree in the middle of a city.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:12):**  You would plant something that's more vertical so that you're not always having to hack away  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:18):**  at it, because that's not good for the climate either.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:23):**  You'd want to have the tree that is the right shape for the space that you have.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:29):**  And so often I see people planting trees under the wires.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:34):**  You know, professional landscaping jobs along the road, not far from here, people planted  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:42):**  longleaf pines, which is a huge tree, right under the wires.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:47):**  And what bothers me as a native plant enthusiast is that they're going to have to either top  
**[0:35:54-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:35:54):**  those trees or slice off half of them as they grow up next to those wires, and then they're  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:01):**  going to say, the managers of the city or the town where they planted them, they're  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:06):**  saying, well, we tried native plants and they didn't work.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:10):**  And it wasn't because it was native, it's because they planted the wrong plant in that  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:15):**  spot.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:16):**  We need to plant the right plants in the right spot.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:19):**  And that means that we have to consider the infrastructure that's there, especially in  
**[0:36:24-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:24):**  areas where there are overhead wires, buildings, sidewalks, roads, and other things around  
**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:30):**  them.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:31):**  We need to be careful of that infrastructure with our plants.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:34):**  Right.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:35):**  It seems like such a common sense thing, but you know, a simple misjudgment like that.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:40):**  I mean, even if the wires were put in later, that design needs to be considered a lot more  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:45):**  effectively.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:46):**  Right.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:47):**  And now, so it seems like as so many other things are when managing living ecosystems,  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:54):**  all of these decisions that we make have a lot of different functions aside from just  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:36:59):**  their primary ones.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:00):**  So perhaps you're planting something to increase biodiversity and attract insects, but at the  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:06):**  same time, it's building soil and creating edge or buffer zones to reduce the risk of  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:12):**  natural disasters and on and on.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:14):**  So it seems like if you select carefully and design appropriately, you only have to kind  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:21):**  of focus on some of the broad strokes and realize that as your ecosystem develops, many  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:26):**  other functions will be taken care of as the system matures.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:33):**  That's absolutely right.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:34):**  There's a multiplier effect, I would say.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:37):**  So that, yeah, when you plant a butterfly garden, you are attracting the pollinators  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:43):**  and you're also building up soil and you're also allowing the native bees and wasps that  
**[0:37:50-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:50):**  nest in the ground to have an area that they can nest in so that it all multiplies together  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:37:58):**  and enhances the overall effect.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:01):**  Now, the other thing, since you guys are into permaculture, is food.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:07):**  And what we found in the research that we did is that when you grow your own food, it  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:14):**  makes a huge difference for the climate because for every pound of food that you grow or buy  
**[0:38:21-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:21):**  from a local grower, it can offset up to two pounds of greenhouse gases.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:29):**  That's an excellent statistic.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:31):**  Isn't that amazing?  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:33):**  So you can feel really good about growing your own food.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:39):**  I mean, it gives me goosebumps.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:40):**  It just is so exciting that we can support our local growers, even in our yards.  
**[0:38:49-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:38:49):**  And here in Florida, there's a number of ways that you can get food grown in your own yard  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:00):**  when somebody else is the farmer.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:01):**  So we have these bike farmers.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:04):**  So they bike around in a neighborhood and they grow the food in your yard for you and  
**[0:39:10-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:10):**  you get part of the harvest and they get the rest of the harvest to support the organization  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:17):**  that they're working for.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:18):**  So there are a lot of ways that you can get food grown, even if you don't have the time  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:25):**  to do it.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:26):**  Yeah, I love initiatives like that so much.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:28):**  We're currently trying to get underway with a community agricultural cooperative here  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:34):**  in the valley in Sununan on Lake Atitlan in Guatemala, where we live.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:40):**  And you know, there's a lot of intricacies within that.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:43):**  But this small valley has the potential to create a huge surplus of food and high nutrition,  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:50):**  high value crops.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:53):**  If we just start to transition away from some of the destructive land management practices  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:39:59):**  that have pervaded here for a handful of decades.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:02):**  And I would imagine it's the same in many other places, many other neighborhoods and  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:06):**  communities around the world.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:08):**  Right.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:09):**  Actually, I've been to Lake Atitlan a couple of years ago.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:14):**  So we went there and toured the gardens around the lake.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:21):**  There's an amazing number of gardens around that lake.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:25):**  It's just very heartening.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:27):**  We took lots of pictures.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:29):**  Chris had also grown coffee and other things like that.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:32):**  So yeah, it's an interesting place.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:34):**  Yeah, it's an incredibly biodiverse region.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:36):**  I mean, Guatemala is, I believe, number four for biodiversity in any country in the world.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:42):**  I think it's just behind the countries that have Amazon rainforest in it, because there's  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:48):**  just so much edge effect here.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:50):**  We have a little bit of everything.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:51):**  We've got coasts on two major oceans.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:54):**  We've got mountain ridges.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:40:55):**  We have a small desert patch and just about everything in between in those transition  
**[0:41:00-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:00):**  zones.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:01):**  And it's a fantastic place to be experimenting with ecological and living systems around  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:06):**  here.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:07):**  You've got to come and visit us again sometime.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:08):**  Yeah, maybe so.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:09):**  I'll give you the tour of all the permaculture initiatives and the natural buildings that  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:13):**  we're working on here.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:14):**  Well, that's good.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:15):**  I'll let you know next time we're in the area.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:18):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:19):**  So before we let you go, could you tell us a little bit about how our listeners can get  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:22):**  in contact with you and find some of the many other resources that you've put out there,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:27):**  including your books?  
**[0:41:28-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:28):**  Yes, I have a website called greengardeningmatters.com and I have links on there to the five books  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:38):**  that I've written now.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:39):**  I'm supposed to be retired, but that didn't really happen.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:42):**  I turned into something else when I retired.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:46):**  As I said, I was an accidental garden writer and I've written hundreds of articles in various  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:41:56):**  media posts and magazines and blogs and whatever.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:00):**  So I have that list of resources and that links to many of the articles that I've written.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:11):**  But you can also go to climatewiselandscaping.com, which leads to the website that Sue Reed,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:20):**  my co-author, and I are working on right now to make that into a more climate-oriented  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:29):**  resource page.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:30):**  We're not done with it yet, but you can buy our book there, which means that you're buying  
**[0:42:35-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:35):**  it directly from Sue rather than from Amazon.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:43):**  So I'll toss out a little bit more.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:46):**  So it's climatewiselandscaping.com.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:50):**  There's no dash or anything.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:51):**  It's all run together.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:52):**  Perfect.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:53):**  Well, I'll make sure to put all of those links in the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:42:57):**  And Ginny, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:00):**  It's been wonderful and very eye-opening to get your perspective on all of these different  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:05):**  options for transitioning away from chemical-intensive, lawn-centric landscaping.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:12):**  That's good.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:13):**  Synthetic chemicals.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:14):**  Exactly.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:15):**  Yes.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:16):**  Again, thank you for making the distinction.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:17):**  Okay.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:18):**  All right.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:19):**  Thanks very much, Oliver.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:20):**  Hey, it was a pleasure having you.

**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ginny-stibolt/#t=0:43:24):**  Have a good day.

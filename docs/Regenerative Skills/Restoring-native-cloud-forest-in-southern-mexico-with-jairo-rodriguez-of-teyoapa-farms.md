**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright welcome back everybody, today I'm going to kick off a new series focusing on  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:20):**  reforestation and agroforestry.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:22):**  I've been motivated to return to this subject as it seems to be unusually pressing these  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:27):**  days.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:28):**  The wildfires in the western US and the Amazon rainforest are not only destructive to these  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:32):**  regions in isolation, they also have major ripple effects across the globe and in our  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:37):**  collective resiliency.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:38):**  I've been fortunate enough to work directly with people and organizations through my travels  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:44):**  who are working on the front lines of reforestation, and in the next few episodes I'll be sharing  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:48):**  interviews with people who represent private land projects, agroforestry pioneering, corporate  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:53):**  innovation, NGO initiatives, and more in an attempt to understand the challenges and also  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:01:58):**  the potential of bringing trees back into a landscape either in an attempt to reestablish  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:02):**  the native ecology or to adapt it to our economic needs, while still addressing the need for  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:07):**  wild habitat, species diversity, soil health, and so many other benefits of forest and jungle  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:13):**  ecosystems.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:15):**  Given that this is the first episode in the series, I would love to hear from anyone listening  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:19):**  if they know of any reforestation or agroforestry projects that I should know about or think  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:24):**  that I should highlight here on the podcast, especially if anyone knows of initiatives  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:28):**  in the Iberian Peninsula, Spain, Portugal, Andorra, or throughout the Mediterranean and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:33):**  North Africa.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:35):**  As always, you can send information and feedback to me directly at info at abundantedge.com  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:39):**  or through the contact page on the website at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:42):**  So, let's get started.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:45):**  Back in May of this year, I was backpacking through southern Mexico.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:48):**  I learned about Tehuapa Farms in Jico, Veracruz and reached out to them to volunteer for a  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:54):**  short time and get to know their project and help out.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:02:57):**  I spent just over a week with them and was amazed at how they had transformed the land  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:01):**  that they had purchased only about 15 years ago from degraded pasture land into a young  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:06):**  native cloud forest.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:08):**  Jairo Rodriguez, the co-owner and manager along with his family, sat down with me on  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:13):**  a visit up to their land to talk about how they got started.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:17):**  In this interview, we talked about the urgent need for protection in the quickly dwindling  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:21):**  areas of remaining cloud forests in Mexico and around the world.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:25):**  Jairo has a very strong worldview and philosophy that guides his investments in time and energy  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:30):**  and the enterprises that he runs.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:33):**  I had the pleasure of learning how they make yogurt, cheese, ice cream, chocolate, and  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:38):**  many other artisanal products from their farm and the producers around them, but even more  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:43):**  importantly how they use those to build community even more than to generate profit.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:48):**  Jairo also owns a company that makes high quality tents designed to last a long time  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:52):**  and have a light footprint on the land so people can live comfortably in nature without  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:57):**  leaving a scarring impact.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:03:59):**  In general, I left the place inspired by the potential of what a few people can do with  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:03):**  the right motivation and how humans have the power to do as much to heal the land they  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:07):**  interact with as they do to damage it when their hearts are in the right place.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:12):**  As a short preview of my time in Hiko and Teauapa Farms, I also made a short video with  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:17):**  Jairo, which I'm releasing today to accompany this interview.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:20):**  I really encourage you to see the incredible forest that Jairo has helped to create.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:25):**  You can find the video in the show notes for this episode where you'll also find information  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:28):**  on how to contact Teauapa and help contribute to their reforestation goals.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:33):**  So now I'll hand things over to Jairo.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:36):**  Alright so Jairo, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:40):**  Be with us, I'm actually staying at your place.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:42):**  You've hosted me now for almost a week and I've had an amazing time here just outside  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:47):**  of Hiko in Veracruz, Mexico.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:49):**  How's your day going?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:50):**  I'm doing well.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:51):**  It's a very nice day.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:53):**  It's not too hot.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:04:54):**  The clouds seem like it might rain a little bit, so that's a good thing.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:00):**  It is, yeah.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:01):**  We're in a wonderful season this time of year.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:02):**  So there's a ton of material that I'd love to cover with you, especially about reforestation  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:08):**  and all the things that you've been teaching me and sort of showing me in the time that  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:11):**  I've been here.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:12):**  But to get started, why don't you tell us a little bit about your personal background.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:16):**  How you got, or sort of how you grew up between Mexico and the United States and what got  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:21):**  you back into working on the land.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:23):**  Right, well I grew up mostly in Mexico City up till I was about 16.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:29):**  I ran my own business at that time.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:32):**  I was delivering vegetables and fruits to the moms of my friends.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:37):**  And at some point my dad, he had a big ranch, a cattle ranch near Acayucan in the state  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:44):**  of Veracruz.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:46):**  And he suggested to plant chili as a business venture and had a little bit of money saved  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:54):**  up and I saw the numbers and was quite excited about the possibilities.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:05:58):**  I knew nothing about growing crops.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:02):**  But I guess because I didn't know anything, I thought it was a great idea and so I went  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:08):**  and did it.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:09):**  I lost all my savings promptly, but I traded that for a love of the land.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:16):**  It changed my life.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:18):**  I didn't go back to Mexico City after that.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:20):**  I just gained a different perspective of the world and yeah, the city didn't attract me  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:28):**  after living like that.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:31):**  We started a program of reforestation at my dad's farm back then, mostly allowing the  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:39):**  natural vegetation to grow, starting with the repairing areas near the river and all  
**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:46):**  the springs and reducing somewhat the impact of the cattle in this property.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:54):**  It was quite big back then.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:57):**  He was partnered with my uncle.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:06:59):**  It was about 700 acres.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:02):**  So it was a good amount of property to keep trees growing in.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:10):**  After that time, I moved to the States.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:16):**  I had an opportunity to move.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:18):**  My mom had naturalized and she offered me to help me immigrate.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:25):**  I tried that out for a couple of years, but the love for the land never left me, so I  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:32):**  ended up going back to my dad's farm.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:35):**  At that point, I went in business with a friend and we took a course of organic farming just  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:45):**  by chance.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:46):**  We found somebody else on the street and I was telling them what I was doing.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:52):**  She's like, well, guess what?  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:53):**  There's an organic farming course.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:56):**  Why don't you go and check that out?  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:07:57):**  And so we did and it hooked us into organic.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:00):**  That was the first time I started getting into organic.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:05):**  We did much better in that crop.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:09):**  It was also chilly and it completely changed my view of growing crops and taking care of  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:18):**  the land.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:19):**  We were doing composts at an industrial level with tractors and machines and we're using  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:27):**  compost to fertilize the ground for the chili plants.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:30):**  We also were growing at the dry season, which made it a lot more challenging and we were  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:37):**  using motors to pump water and whatnot.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:43):**  We had problems with the motors and the whole crop failed because of that, but the previous  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:50):**  results were obviously much better than my attempt before that.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:08:57):**  So I kept going with this because I'm pretty stubborn and kept going with the organic farming  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:02):**  of chili and I started diversifying also.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:05):**  We started making cheese at my dad's farm back then and offering it as a product.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:12):**  And the third trial for the chili was way more successful.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:16):**  We were more experienced with the organic aspect of the farming and we minimized the  
**[0:09:25-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:25):**  problems we had with bugs, which had been a big issue at the first conventional crop.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:34):**  And this time we had minimal problems with bugs, which is a big issue in the tropics.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:40):**  We also changed our watering system to flooding and that also helped because it was simpler.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:47):**  It was just simpler technology.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:49):**  Fewer things to go wrong.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:51):**  Totally.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:52):**  Totally.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:09:53):**  The least technology one requires in my experience, the more reliable the system is.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:00):**  Once you make it more complex with technology, number one, there's things that are going  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:06):**  to go wrong that you cannot fix.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:09):**  And if it's some crucial system like the watering system, then your whole crop can fail within  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:14):**  days.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:15):**  And that was my experience at that point.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:18):**  This one point of failure.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:20):**  Well, if you don't have redundancy, then that can do you in.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:25):**  So let's switch gears a little bit now and tell me about how you came to acquire the  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:28):**  land that we're sitting on at the moment and how you got the vision to reforest this parcel.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:35):**  Well, specifically after we moved to Hiko, me and my family, we got together with some  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:44):**  friends that we had known in an environmental movement.  
**[0:10:51-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:10:51):**  We used to be camp outs and sweat lodges and workshops all focused in environment.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:02):**  And when we moved to Hiko, we met with them and we had this idea of buying land together.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:08):**  And so we started looking.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:10):**  People were offering me land constantly and we found a pretty good sized property and  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:17):**  a very affordable price.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:19):**  Here's what we see in the background over there.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:23):**  That's that forest that we see back there.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:25):**  It used to be a pasture, not more than 15 years ago.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:30):**  I've seen the pictures from when you first bought it.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:31):**  How long ago was that?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:33):**  That must have been about 13 years ago, I would say.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:42):**  And it was almost entirely barren from the videos that I could see.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:46):**  I'll put pictures on the podcast so that people can see the scenery behind you.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:50):**  But it's a very lush forest right now.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:53):**  Now, certainly it's young.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:54):**  13 years is not enough time for a lot of the more mature trees to get established, but  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:11:59):**  it's still a huge transformation from sort of a barren grassland that must have taken  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:03):**  just an immense amount of energy to maintain at that state because we're in an environment  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:08):**  that desperately wants to go back to forest.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:11):**  That's right.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:12):**  In fact, the grass areas have become minimal.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:16):**  There's a few pasture areas in that property.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:20):**  Everything turned to forest, everything else.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:22):**  There's a lot of water.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:23):**  There's several springs and a stream that runs through it, and the forest just grew  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:30):**  back.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:31):**  We let it be.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:33):**  We stopped putting cows in there because they used to have cows previously, and the forest  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:41):**  just basically grew back again in a very quick manner.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:46):**  Very impressive.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:47):**  Now, some of the forest you see is a subsequent purchase of property by a family of one of  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:12:56):**  the partners in the original purchase.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:01):**  They were very impressed at the growth of the forest in that original purchase, so much  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:06):**  so that they decided to buy the adjacent property.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:10):**  It was totally pasture.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:14):**  I remember when they went to visit, they had just finished chopping everything.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:18):**  There was a few big trees here and there, of course, but that was it.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:24):**  As you can see, it just grew back.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:27):**  That part of the forest is younger yet than the original property that we purchased.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:33):**  It's amazing to think, looking at it now, that this is going to be much larger and more  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:37):**  lush in just another handful of years, and that each step of sequential growth and maturation  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:44):**  of the system is going to bring in a whole other variety of life and diversity to this  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:50):**  area.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:52):**  What other than just kind of neglecting the areas and allowing them to grow back as they  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:13:56):**  naturally would, would you tell someone who's trying to reforest a property of their own?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:01):**  Now obviously, the climate and the variables where they live are going to determine a lot  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:06):**  of what's going to work there, but what have you found has helped this go back to its original  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:13):**  state or its level of health?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:15):**  I must say the one factor that has made the biggest difference, it's inaccessibility.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:24):**  You have to walk.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:25):**  It's not truly inaccessible.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:26):**  You have to walk about half hour from the road to get there.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:31):**  I must say that probably is what has made the most difference because people just don't  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:35):**  mess with it.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:37):**  There's a few locals that might go in and hunt or take some wood, but it's truly minimal.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:43):**  It's just not enough people around here that have enough energy to go and mess with it.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:49):**  As for the owners, the ones that we purchased the property originally, our main focus was  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:14:59):**  conservation from the beginning.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:02):**  That's something we talked about and we agreed on.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:05):**  That's the most important focus of purchasing that property.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:09):**  You just let it grow, let the forest grow.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:13):**  We planted a few trees here and there, but the one suggestion I could make or the one  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:20):**  different thing I would make, I would probably plant more forestry trees, very focused in  
**[0:15:26-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:26):**  subsequent harvest and definitely I would have reintroduced more of the endangered species.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:36):**  Now we planted some fruit trees quite a way from the beginning and they were not successful.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:46):**  They just didn't get the care they were required in terms of manuring or pruning or protecting  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:53):**  them from foraging animals.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:15:59):**  I realized that nature knows what to do to heal itself.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:04):**  In terms of reforestation in this region specifically, I don't think there's a more effective way  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:10):**  or inexpensive at it than letting it be and letting it do itself.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:17):**  Yes, reintroduce some trees that you're interested in, especially if you want to harvest eventually,  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:22):**  but that's about it.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:25):**  Now let's start from the beginning about how you started or you're still in the formation  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:30):**  process of an organization where you're bringing in yourself and multiple friends and collaborators  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:35):**  here in the valley in order to expand this reforestation project.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:41):**  Can you talk a little bit about that?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:43):**  Yes, precisely.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:45):**  When the group, the original purchasers of that property got together, we're all acquaintances  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:52):**  and friends and we had a common vision and we basically started to put that common vision  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:16:59):**  into paper.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:00):**  We started writing down our agreements.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:04):**  What did we agree on?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:07):**  We would get together as potlucks and we had food.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:13):**  We did sweat lodges sometimes and we would just talk and we'd come in with ideas.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:19):**  Sometimes we all agreed on an idea, we just write it down.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:22):**  We dated it and we wrote it down and wrote down who was present at that meeting.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:30):**  We kept that going for years.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:31):**  At some point they became more formal and we followed a protocol that was thanks to  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:38):**  somebody that was experienced on doing this type of things.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:43):**  We decided that we would form a nonprofit organization to transfer the property title  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:53):**  to.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:17:54):**  We figured that eventually any of us could die and we're all going to die and we wanted  
**[0:18:01-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:01):**  to make sure that there was not going to be future problems with inheritance and people  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:10):**  becoming involved that wouldn't have the same focus as the original owners.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:17):**  We did form this nonprofit.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:19):**  It took us years of hacking at the bylaws because they didn't know anything about it.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:27):**  We gathered the bylaws of different nonprofits that were similar or they had a similar focus  
**[0:18:36-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:36):**  as ours and we started taking ideas from some of them and putting our ideas especially we  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:44):**  transferred the reality of how we organized.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:49):**  One of the key points was decisions by consensus and made by a council.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:18:56):**  We decided on two levels of membership in the nonprofit.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:02):**  The one level we call it active members are the people that are in this region and that  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:08):**  are able to attend the meetings where the decisions get made.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:14):**  In order to become an active member you got to show up to six months of meetings basically  
**[0:19:20-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:20):**  to make sure that you're available and that you are involved in the project.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:30):**  The active members they have a right to vote on decisions and of course the obligation  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:38):**  to show up.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:40):**  And then we have a different level of membership which we call it honorary members and that's  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:44):**  the member the people that are also involved in the original land purchase but that are  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:50):**  not within the region and that cannot be directly involved at the meetings.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:19:56):**  We have a protocol specific protocol that allows at least a week between the proposal  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:20:05):**  of a decision and the actual voting for the decision which gives time for the honorary  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:20:12):**  members that are not present to cast their opinion and made it heard to the council.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:20:19):**  So that that's one of the things we figured to allow the honorary members to participate  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:20:24):**  in the decision making process and the honorary membership also allows for people that want  
**[0:20:32-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:20:32):**  to be involved in the in the project that may not want to put money into it or may not  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:20:41):**  want to be fully involved in as a full member as an active member but that would like to  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:20:47):**  offer ideas that would like to make contacts with other organizations etc etc and that  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:20:56):**  space is allowed through the honorary membership also.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:00):**  So talk to me a little bit now about where you see the potential of this organization  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:04):**  going obviously it's been founded to help to preserve this land in a pristine state  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:10):**  or allow it the capacity to continue to regenerate in the way that nature would have normally  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:17):**  managed it.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:19):**  How do you plan to expand perhaps even acquire more land and continue this mission of conservation  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:25):**  and regeneration?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:27):**  Well one thing that has hit me recently I've been reading a lot about the state of the  
**[0:21:34-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:34):**  world in terms of degradation of the environment and global warming and it's pretty clear that  
**[0:21:43-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:43):**  we're at an key point of time where we can still avoid some of the worst catastrophes  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:52):**  that may happen if we don't act on it.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:21:57):**  My experience with this reforestation project tells me that this region and this altitude  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:22:07):**  has an incredible capacity for growing forests and that implies taking carbon out of the  
**[0:22:14-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:22:14):**  atmosphere basically turning it into soil and keeping it there as soil and one of the  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:22:22):**  big advantages of this region is so wet that so far fire has not been an issue.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:22:29):**  Doesn't mean it may not be in the future but this is one of the reasons why the forest  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:22:33):**  can grow so lush and so quickly the amount of humidity.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:22:38):**  Also we're at an altitude where it doesn't hardly ever freeze so it allows trees to keep  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:22:45):**  growing year-round and the summers are the weather is pretty ideal the temperatures which  
**[0:22:51-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:22:51):**  also allows the trees to keep growing at their maximum potential and so my vision in order  
**[0:23:00-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:23:00):**  to potentialize this experience is to be able to purchase more property and allow it to  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:23:10):**  grow for it just as we did through the nonprofit organization.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:23:15):**  I want to allow for donations from people that are conscious and want to participate  
**[0:23:26-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:23:26):**  in the healing of the environment and of the world at large and also allow for memberships  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:23:35):**  for people that want to truly be involved in this project.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:23:40):**  We envision no permanent structures within the area that is protected by the ownership  
**[0:23:49-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:23:49):**  of the nonprofit and we are testing non-permanent structures that can be very comfortable akin  
**[0:23:59-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:23:59):**  to glamping on wooden platforms hanging from trees where people can come and visit.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:08):**  People that get involved with the project that may not want to move into this region  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:11):**  but they want to be involved and perform in the healing and they can come and stay here  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:18):**  for a few weeks of the year and enjoy.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:22):**  In this case it would be the fruit of their labors through the conservation effort.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:29):**  I guess succinctly the vision that I have of growing this forest.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:37):**  Well that is a perfect transition into some of the ways that you are raising funds to  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:41):**  keep this going.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:42):**  Now I know you have a lot of different enterprises between your house, between what you sell  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:47):**  with the organic cooperative around here and the GOMES themselves.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:50):**  So tell me about some of the ways that you have found to create high quality and ethical  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:24:57):**  products with the resources around in this region.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:00):**  Now when you're talking about products you're talking also about the for-profit aspect of  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:07):**  my activities which are also deeply interrelated with the conservation efforts.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:14):**  They are basically a property, several properties that are adjacent to the forest areas and  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:26):**  which are also growing forest.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:28):**  But at the same time we are developing production systems that are friendly with the forest.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:36):**  One of them has been the pasturing of goats in some of the areas of the forest.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:45):**  The goats have a lot of space to pasture and they eat what would be considered weeds.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:51):**  They just grow wild and they know what they like, they know what to eat.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:55):**  They go out every day and they go to different areas.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:25:59):**  They pasture and they come back.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:02):**  We milk the goats, we make cheese and we sell the cheese at the farmers market that have  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:12):**  been developing for about 15 years here in the region.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:15):**  And that's one way that we have kept the project funded.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:23):**  Also we have cows within the farm area which we're developing some intensive pasturing  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:30):**  systems for with electric fence.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:33):**  And right now we are growing coffee crop.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:41):**  We're starting coffee plantation in the areas that used to be pasture.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:47):**  And the idea here is to combine some of the plants that are used in the coffee plantations  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:26:56):**  as shade as a source of forage for the animals.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:01):**  Very specifically we're talking about banana, there's also leumines trees and a type of  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:09):**  sunflower, a wild variety that grows really well and it's good in protein for the animals.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:15):**  So we're developing a system that includes all these plants and can be fed to the animals.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:22):**  And we're using the manure of the animals to make a biodynamic compost and feed them  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:29):**  to the coffee and all these other plants.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:32):**  So there's a system going on.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:34):**  The animals are kept confined in a small area except for the goats and the sheep that go  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:40):**  to pasture in the bigger area.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:42):**  But they deposit the manure where they sleep, in the barns where they sleep.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:48):**  And that is an excellent source of nutrition for the rest of the productive areas.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:27:54):**  Here is specifically in the productive project, I partner up with one of the owners of the  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:02):**  adjacent properties and my brother-in-law which purchased another adjacent property  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:07):**  and is growing forest, productive forest within it with some nut trees, the coffee and a lot  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:15):**  of forestry trees.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:18):**  That was actually one of the reasons why I was first attracted to come to this farm is  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:22):**  because as most of my listeners know, back at our farm in Guatemala, we had goats, we  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:27):**  had chickens and had kind of a polyculture of cultivation in a very small space.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:33):**  And it's been fascinating for me to see how you manage the resources on a much larger  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:37):**  scale than we had, but have also turned some of those products into really excellent value  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:43):**  added products.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:44):**  You mentioned the cheese, your family is also working on getting access to organic cacao  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:51):**  from nearby region, turning it into very, very good chocolate.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:56):**  What else?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:28:57):**  There's the butter, the ghee, the ice cream, the yogurt.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:01):**  We did yogurt, we did some cheeses at our place, but we never had the apparatuses or  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:05):**  the machinery to do hardened or semi-hardened cheese.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:11):**  That process has been fascinating to watch.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:13):**  Really by the time this interview comes out, I'll also have the videos of going through  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:16):**  all of those different steps because that was really eye opening for me to see not only  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:22):**  that it was accessible to do, but also the level of mastery that you can put into it  
**[0:29:26-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:26):**  if you're willing to pay attention, pay close attention really to the variables and keep  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:34):**  detailed records until you get a really high quality product that can be reproduced.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:40):**  Talk a little bit more now about this idea of non-permanent structures and how you came  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:45):**  to the design for the Gomes.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:47):**  Right.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:48):**  The non-permanent structures I was talking about are a type of tent that we developed  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:29:55):**  in Xico, a business partner, my business partner and I.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:02):**  We've been doing it for 10 years.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:03):**  My business partner, he did a horse carton all the way from Costa Rica throughout many  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:09):**  years.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:11):**  I met him at a rainbow gathering near Caramaco here in the state of Veracruz.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:17):**  I was quite intrigued about his effort of doing this riding all throughout Mexico and  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:24):**  third world countries.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:25):**  I was pretty impressed.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:27):**  Well, I met him again at a different gathering also in Veracruz in Chihuapas.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:36):**  One day he came knocking at my door in Xico.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:39):**  He knew we lived here and guess he asked around where we lived exactly.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:43):**  And he asked me to go help him move his horses because he was nearby with 25 horses, only  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:48):**  had like five riders.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:49):**  So I got my family together and some friends.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:30:53):**  When we went to help move the horses, he had found pasture right next to a property.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:01):**  Somehow he figured it out.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:02):**  Just show up, talk to the right people.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:06):**  We allowed him to pasture some of his horses in our property.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:10):**  And he basically stayed here in Xico for a couple of years.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:13):**  He rented a place and took care of his horses.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:16):**  Of course, at some point he was hurting for money.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:20):**  He came and offered me some saddle bags that he had developed.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:28):**  Really good quality.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:29):**  I was quite impressed.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:30):**  I had seen him at the gatherings before and I was like, yes, I'll buy them.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:35):**  These are good stuff.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:36):**  Paid him money, everything good.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:40):**  And at some point I asked him, why are you making this for selling commercially?  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:45):**  This is really good products.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:47):**  He said he thought about it and at some point he proposed me to go into business.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:52):**  He says, look, I don't have money.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:54):**  I had the experience because we've been making this for a while.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:31:57):**  We also made tents and we've also made clothes.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:01):**  Part of his thing is making his own stuff in the trip.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:07):**  I had a little bit of money back then from an internet business.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:10):**  So I said, yeah, that sounds like a good proposal.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:13):**  I figured diversifying at that point was a good idea.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:17):**  And so I put a bit of money into it and he went to buy materials in Mexico City and brought  
**[0:32:25-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:25):**  them back, found a local source to start making the prototypes and basically we started selling  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:34):**  this stuff to friends at first.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:37):**  And the tents were one of the most successful products.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:41):**  We sold some clothes, we sold some saddlebags, we made a website, we promoted the website  
**[0:32:48-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:48):**  and he always attends gatherings and events so he would go to the events and started offering  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:56):**  our products.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:57):**  And well, they started moving a little bit.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:32:59):**  We didn't have a big production at first.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:02):**  We were reinvesting all the money that was coming in.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:06):**  In fact, we did for most of the time the business, the partnership has been working and we started  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:15):**  perfecting the products, especially the tents, the gomes.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:19):**  And well, it's been years just improving and improving on the designs, listening to clients'  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:27):**  feedback.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:29):**  My partner, he actually lives in the gomes.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:34):**  He lives in Tulum right now and he experiences full time living in them.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:41):**  Me and my family, we moved to the farm a few years ago and we lived in gomes for about  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:46):**  six months.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:47):**  It was one of the most wonderful experiences.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:50):**  We could possibly start building something at our property, but the truth is we're not  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:57):**  interested in building.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:33:58):**  We prefer living in the gomes close to nature and being able to put them wherever we like  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:06):**  and maybe change them with the seasons.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:09):**  And well, one of the most recent developments that is very attractive to us and we're also  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:15):**  in a prototyping stage here is the wooden platforms.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:20):**  I was mentioning those ones hung on trees.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:23):**  My partner already did it when he lived in Chiapas and he's doing it right now for glamping  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:29):**  hotels in Mayan Riviera.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:36):**  But we want to do it in the forest.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:39):**  We want to do it in this forest and we want to be able to offer it to like-minded people  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:48):**  who would like to develop minimal impact lifestyles.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:34:55):**  My idea of change in this world is not about getting more stuff or becoming richer or even  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:07):**  successful in the terms that society understands it nowadays.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:13):**  My vision of improving the world is to change our lifestyle where we require less.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:23):**  Less from the environment, less from the world, where we do not need to spew carbon dioxide  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:31):**  into the atmosphere from our activities or from the junk that we buy or from the work  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:38):**  that we do for that matter.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:40):**  I've had experience in gatherings, in rainbow gatherings specifically, living out in the  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:45):**  forest as communities and it works.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:51):**  Maybe the rainbow gathering is not the perfect example of sustainability but I believe it's  
**[0:35:56-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:35:56):**  the most perfect example of low-impact lifestyle that I've seen because you don't require much  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:04):**  to live in the forest.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:07):**  Entertainment is just part of the everyday lifestyle of regular activities.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:15):**  It's one of the most fun experiences I've had in my life, even as a family when we lived  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:22):**  here in the Gomes.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:25):**  My whole family remembers it as one of the most enjoyable and enduring experiences they  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:33):**  have.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:34):**  They look back to this time as some of the best time in their lives.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:38):**  They told me, my kids have told me that.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:41):**  That tells me that definitely it's worth pursuing.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:47):**  Our plan is to do that.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:49):**  We're going to keep making cheese and we're going to keep making chocolate but we want  
**[0:36:54-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:36:54):**  to minimize our carbon footprint and our impact in the world and just learn and be able to  
**[0:37:03-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:03):**  develop a lifestyle that works here in the forest and be able to offer that to other  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:12):**  people to teach it and to welcome people to try it out.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:16):**  See, in my own experience, and you and I have talked a lot about this because you've done  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:19):**  a lot of natural building as well and that used to be my specialty, especially when I  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:23):**  lived back in Guatemala and was traveling more often, but I've gradually come to the  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:28):**  conclusion that the most natural way of building isn't necessarily just with earth materials  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:33):**  or with bamboo or any technique in particular.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:36):**  It's whatever the environment where you're in calls for and what's appropriate for that.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:41):**  In so many cases, it's renovating existing structures or putting up temporary ones.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:46):**  This is one of the first places where I've seen such a positive and potentially replicable  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:52):**  example of a high quality product that you can put out in nature, that you can move periodically  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:37:58):**  so it doesn't choke out the soil, but can also stay there for a significant period of  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:03):**  time under quite heavy weather conditions and be very comfortable, can be altered slightly  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:09):**  for better ventilation, can be shut up in order to keep it warmer inside, can even host  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:15):**  a fire if you're going to be cooking in there.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:17):**  I think that in most cases, especially for people like in my generation who increasingly  
**[0:38:23-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:23):**  are moving around, exploring the world, they're sort of finding themselves travels, we end  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:30):**  up using so many resources in doing that even if our own possessions and our lifestyles  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:35):**  are kind of minimal.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:36):**  I would love to see a temporary structure, community or an option to stay like this when  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:46):**  you're traveling around be available in many more places, especially when the environment  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:51):**  around is so conducive to living close to nature and you don't need very much as far  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:56):**  as shelter during most of the year.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:38:59):**  That's definitely an advantage of this region.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:02):**  The weather is not extreme and at the same time, the gums allow for comfort in even more  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:10):**  extreme weathers.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:12):**  We've designed them like I was explaining through the suggestions of clients that live  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:17):**  in cold weather and clients that live in hot weather.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:21):**  So we've adapted them.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:23):**  Like as an example, the original gum and we keep that feature up to date, it's got 360  
**[0:39:32-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:32):**  degree ventilation.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:33):**  It's got mosquito netting all around.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:36):**  And at the same time, you can close it with a wall made out of material.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:41):**  The materials can change according to the client's requirement.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:45):**  The lightweight materials can be packed on a bag on your back and taken wherever.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:52):**  They're very light.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:39:54):**  And there's a heavier duty material that can last 10, 15 years in full sun.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:01):**  And well, it definitely depends on the requirements of each client.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:06):**  We actually adapt to the client and tells us, I need this and this and this, and we  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:12):**  make it to their specification.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:14):**  If it's for cold, for example, and even for hot, we use a double roof.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:19):**  We have what we call an inner roof of a lightweight material that is visually very nice.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:26):**  It has a hole in the middle that can be used for the ventilation when it's hot.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:31):**  But the advantage is that creates an air space between the outer roof and this inner roof  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:37):**  that insulates the heat when the sun hits the outer roof.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:42):**  At the same time, the middle hole allows for the ventilation.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:47):**  The gum is similar to a yurt in a form, but it only requires one middle pole.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:40:55):**  We make stainless steel poles that are telescopic.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:00):**  You can take them apart and carry them with you.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:04):**  And you can also use a bamboo pole or a piece of wood, or you can hang it from a tree or  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:13):**  anywhere that is above of your roof.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:18):**  So it's very versatile.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:21):**  Like you mentioned, a fire can be made inside the bigger models.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:26):**  That's how we cook when we live with my family here.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:29):**  We had a small fire when it got a little chilly and we also cooked on it.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:35):**  And we ended up putting a few for different things.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:40):**  Like an example, we had a smaller one for a bathroom.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:42):**  We used a composting bucket system.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:48):**  And then we had one for the kitchen.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:51):**  And that's where we had the main fire later on.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:41:55):**  And then we had a small one for equipment like tools and the horse gear, etc. etc.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:02):**  And it worked really well.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:03):**  Now that the kids are grown up, now they start having their own space, their own gum.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:09):**  So we can be in a beautiful place and we can live as a family and collaborate as a family.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:15):**  At the same time, we don't have to be in the same spot sleeping together.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:20):**  That was when they were smaller.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:22):**  Yeah, privacy is necessary for sure.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:26):**  Well, so let's shift gears again a little bit.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:28):**  And kind of we've been building up to this point, but so much of what you and I have  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:32):**  talked about in the short time that I've been here is about your larger philosophy of creating  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:36):**  resilience in your life and securing some of the key resources to make sure that you  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:42):**  can live with a peace of mind that you can provide for yourself and your family.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:46):**  Now I know that this has resulted in what might even seem like counterintuitive practices  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:52):**  on the farm.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:53):**  You mentioned that keeping the animals maintained, especially as you live in town primarily,  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:42:58):**  is costing you more than perhaps the food products would give you in and of themselves.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:02):**  But there's a larger idea behind there that there's a resilience to your life that they  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:08):**  create.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:09):**  So tell me a little bit about how and why you've created the types of resilience for  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:14):**  yourself and your family that you have.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:16):**  Well, most definitely.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:17):**  I must say that the amount of animals that we have, we don't grow enough crops to provide  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:27):**  for them.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:28):**  So yes, I have to spend money outside of the system to purchase that forage.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:35):**  And at the same time, we're developing this coffee plantation system I was telling you  
**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:40):**  about, which I hope and expected to provide those crops in exchange for the manure that  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:47):**  the animals provide in keeping the system stable.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:51):**  And yes, very specifically, I've decided to keep the animals because I see the future  
**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:43:59):**  in a way.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:00):**  Well, number one, I love this lifestyle.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:02):**  I love animals.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:04):**  I love making cheese.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:06):**  I like living out in the forest.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:10):**  And that's the number one reason.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:12):**  But the second reason is a sort of insurance.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:16):**  I don't want to depend on food that has to travel halfway around the world to get to  
**[0:44:22-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:22):**  my plate.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:24):**  I don't think that's right in terms of carbon emissions and in terms of food security.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:31):**  It's terrible.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:33):**  Any time that system gets disrupted, which I believe will happen sooner rather than later,  
**[0:44:39-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:39):**  could be a weather disaster or a financial disaster or the lack of fossil fuels or God  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:48):**  knows what.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:50):**  One will be in a terrible bind to feed oneself and one's family.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:44:56):**  One is depending on the grocery store to provide food for the table.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:03):**  So I feel that it's really basic in terms of a long term survival.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:10):**  And I'm not going to say just survival, but development of a sustainable, regenerative  
**[0:45:16-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:16):**  culture.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:18):**  It's absolutely necessary to have a source of protein.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:21):**  I mean, I don't think we could thrive on grass.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:25):**  Hey, some people have done it.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:27):**  I don't know.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:28):**  But I don't think I know of any culture that has just a grass.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:34):**  I know that we need protein to keep ourselves healthy.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:39):**  At least I follow that diet where I minimize eating empty calories and processed food and  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:47):**  try to maximize my input of protein and healthy fats.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:51):**  I feel better than I felt in the rest of my life.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:55):**  So I know it works.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:45:58):**  And for me, the most secure source of protein is through the animals that can concentrate  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:08):**  those proteins from plants into milk.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:11):**  I mean, our ancestors have done it for thousands of years.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:17):**  Whole cultures have thrived.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:19):**  It's worth mentioning that you're not talking so much about just drinking a lot of milk,  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:24):**  that almost all of the products that you make, all the dairy products that you make are fermented  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:28):**  or cultured in some way.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:30):**  And that at least hopefully will help with the people who are listening to this and say,  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:37):**  oh, humans haven't evolved to consume dairy products or whatnot.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:41):**  But I've definitely noticed a difference in how my own body and how the bodies of many  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:45):**  other people react once it's been fermented, broken down by bacteria, and kind of transformed  
**[0:46:50-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:50):**  in a way.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:51):**  And that's something that you've really mastered, you and your family together.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:54):**  I think it's very simple.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:46:56):**  The one transformation, the most important that's happened is the breakdown from lactose  
**[0:47:03-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:03):**  to lactic acid.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:05):**  And that will improve the digestibility for most people.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:10):**  I mean, it really depends on the intolerance to lactose that each person has.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:16):**  But yes, once you ferment the milk into yogurt and you strain the whey out, then you have  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:24):**  a much higher concentration of protein without the lactose.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:28):**  Same with the fermented cheeses.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:30):**  We culture all our cheeses, and we expect them to have a stronger flavor than a fresh  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:38):**  cheese, but at the same time, much lower lactose content.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:43):**  And I must say that in specific, the milk from goats already has a much lower lactose  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:50):**  content than cow's milk from starters.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:54):**  So maybe it's not the same for everybody.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:47:59):**  Maybe it wouldn't work for everybody.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:02):**  And there's an issue with methane emissions from cows.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:08):**  I'm not entirely convinced yet.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:09):**  I believe the real problem is industrial farming.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:16):**  I believe that's one of the aspects that is affecting the environment in a very negative  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:21):**  way for several reasons.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:23):**  And one of them is that most, I should say, all of the food provided for these animals  
**[0:48:29-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:29):**  come from monocultures that require a high input of energy, fossil fuels, and fertilizers.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:37):**  And in very specific, they require herbicides to upkeep, which also creates a whole other  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:46):**  host of problems.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:47):**  And I believe that having high concentration of animals is just not healthy for anybody,  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:53):**  not the animals and not the people that consume their products either.  
**[0:48:56-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:56):**  Certainly not if they stay in one place.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:48:57):**  I know you know very well about holistic management and rotational grazing techniques where you  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:03):**  can have a more concentrated number of animals on a piece of land as long as you rotate them  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:08):**  and allow the lands to actually, descansar, to rest.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:13):**  Right.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:15):**  And you've got to figure that the concentrations, once you take into account the amount of area  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:21):**  that they utilize, it's actually very small, the concentration of animals.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:26):**  And feedlots, they're way too concentrated.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:31):**  And the quality of products are undesirable, I should say.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:35):**  Certainly.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:36):**  So, yes, going back to the resilience idea of a lifestyle, yes, I believe that animals  
**[0:49:47-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:47):**  are an integral part of a lifestyle, especially when one does not want to depend on industry  
**[0:49:56-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:49:56):**  and fossil fuel derived food.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:00):**  And in this specific environment, they seem to work well.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:05):**  They thrive, they grow well, they eat the natural forage.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:12):**  And it can always be improved, of course.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:14):**  We're always finding better ways to do things, you know.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:19):**  But the very basic aspect of it, which is foraging, that works.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:26):**  Now, there's another element that I've been really impressed to see you, and this definitely  
**[0:50:30-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:30):**  to the credit of your family as well, is the amount of community that you've built around  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:36):**  the aspects of what you're doing here.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:38):**  Not only with the people that you've got on board, first of all, with the reforestation  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:43):**  project, but also your participation in the organics cooperative here in the region, and  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:48):**  how well you've taken the time to get to know and participate as sort of contributors into  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:53):**  your community.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:54):**  Tell me a little bit about how that has changed for you over your life, because you mentioned  
**[0:50:59-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:50:59):**  at first growing up in the city and making a transition into the countryside, and some  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:05):**  of the benefits that you've seen of cultivating that level of connectivity in the life around  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:10):**  you.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:11):**  Well, I would say that since I've been making cheese and actually selling it at the markets,  
**[0:51:18-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:18):**  I've met more people, and I'd say much closer than at any time of my life.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:27):**  It's just allowed to make profound relationships with more people than I ever imagined.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:38):**  Some of the best friendships I've developed have been clients at the beginning.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:45):**  These people that I've had a relationship with through the sales, and I don't just sell  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:51):**  cheese.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:52):**  I talk to people.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:53):**  I ask them.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:54):**  I hear their stories.  
**[0:51:58-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:58):**  Sometimes they want to hear my story.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:51:59):**  I tell them my story, and a lot of people think alike.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:05):**  I think very deep down, we all want the same thing.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:10):**  We all want to be healthy.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:13):**  We all want our families to be healthy.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:15):**  We all want to be happy and our families to be happy.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:19):**  I think it actually breaks down to simple formulas.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:23):**  I personally believe we're being scammed by the industrial system.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:29):**  I think it's a fantasy that things are better or easier when one is hooked and dependent  
**[0:52:41-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:41):**  on the industrial system.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:42):**  I think they just programmed us through education and media to believe that's the best way to  
**[0:52:54-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:54):**  live.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:52:55):**  In fact, when you think about first world countries, a lot of the culture they export  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:02):**  has to do with that.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:04):**  Buy more stuff.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:06):**  Buy consumer stuff.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:09):**  Find more energy, whether moving around or through electronics or travel abroad or whatnot.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:19):**  I call that mental colonization.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:23):**  And I'm not implying that it's only countries that are developing in that sense are the  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:32):**  victims of that colonization.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:34):**  No.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:35):**  I think it's our minds.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:38):**  Everybody that is connected to this system that reads media and that is being educated  
**[0:53:44-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:44):**  is being programmed to follow a lifestyle, a culture where they tell you what is success,  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:54):**  what is right, what you should aspire to.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:53:59):**  And I truly believe it's a scam for the benefit of a few.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:07):**  That culture and that way of looking at things tends to devalue this lifestyle.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:14):**  I've seen it with the community of what they call poor people around here.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:20):**  I'm not saying they don't struggle.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:23):**  I'm not saying they haven't lived miserable lives at different times of their upbringing  
**[0:54:30-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:30):**  or their old age.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:34):**  But I believe there's much more value in that lifestyle, which is a low impact lifestyle,  
**[0:54:42-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:42):**  than what is given credit.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:46):**  The people that have grown up like that, a lot of them, they look to the city as an evolution  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:52):**  of their life.  
**[0:54:53-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:54:53):**  They want to move to the city, get a job, maybe get an education, consume more.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:01):**  I think they're also being programmed.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:03):**  I think in that sense, I may have the advantage of having grown up in the city, experienced  
**[0:55:09-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:09):**  it fully, because I did, and then having the contrast of living out in the countryside  
**[0:55:18-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:18):**  and seeing both of them.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:19):**  I don't think many people have that choice in their lives.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:23):**  Most people grow up in the city, they stay in the city.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:25):**  I have plenty of friends that I grew up with.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:28):**  They're all in the city.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:29):**  They didn't move out.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:31):**  They might have visited, going skiing or going to a safari or whatever.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:37):**  That's not the same.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:39):**  That's not a lifestyle.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:41):**  That's just a trip, a visit, just skim it on the surface.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:45):**  It's beautiful, let's protect it, and maybe I'll donate some money to it, maybe.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:49):**  That's not a lifestyle.  
**[0:55:51-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:55:51):**  Lifestyle is unhooking from the industrial products that we depend on to exist.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:01):**  And I believe nowadays there's very few people that live like that, very few.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:09):**  And very few people that depend on natural systems to exist, exist as a community or  
**[0:56:18-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:18):**  exist as a culture.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:19):**  I look to the indigenous cultures for inspiration on that.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:26):**  Indigenous cultures, they didn't industrialize, they lived mostly in some kind of balance  
**[0:56:35-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:35):**  with the environment.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:36):**  And that's why they kept living for thousands of years and kept cultures, long-living cultures  
**[0:56:43-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:43):**  for all that time.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:45):**  They were in balance with the environment.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:47):**  I'm sure they have terrible hardships, mostly when they get conquered.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:53):**  Well there are also quite a few cultures, especially around here, like the Mayan culture  
**[0:56:56-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:56:56):**  itself was in decline even before the Spanish congregation, mostly because in a lot of places  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:03):**  where there were high population centers, they outstripped the resources available to  
**[0:57:07-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:07):**  maintain those populations.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:10):**  And that doesn't mean that they were going to die out completely, but oftentimes populations  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:15):**  of humans throughout the world and throughout history have gone in sort of waves or fluctuations  
**[0:57:20-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:20):**  where they got bigger than they could sustain and then they would dip in population again.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:25):**  And quite frankly, I think that's going to come in a very severe way to modern culture  
**[0:57:30-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:30):**  as it is.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:31):**  I can be awful.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:32):**  And when you mentioned Mayan cultures in specific, well I think the proof is in the pudding.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:38):**  Mayan culture still exists.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:41):**  In Guatemala, in Chiapas, in Yucatan, people still speak the language.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:47):**  People still dress their typical dresses and clothes that they make and they have made.  
**[0:57:55-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:55):**  I'm not saying it's prevalent and a lot has been lost.  
**[0:57:58-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:58):**  Certainly.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:57:59):**  But we might be at the peak of industrial culture right now.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:03):**  Who knows the future?  
**[0:58:04-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:04):**  Nobody does, but it seems like that.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:07):**  And I must say, yes, from the indigenous cultures that we could think they were lost or they  
**[0:58:17-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:17):**  degraded the environment.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:19):**  Yes, their population must have reduced at some point, but the cultures weren't completely  
**[0:58:27-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:27):**  lost.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:28):**  I think some of the last remnants of people that actually live in a balance with their  
**[0:58:35-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:35):**  environment and depend on their environment for the livelihood without destroying it are  
**[0:58:42-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:42):**  these people, these indigenous people.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:45):**  That's been one of the biggest learning experiences for me interacting and working in this region  
**[0:58:49-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:49):**  of the world, is learning from those cultures and not just the wisdom from before, but how  
**[0:58:56-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:58:56):**  they've sort of grown up and changed and in a lot of cases been degraded, but through  
**[0:59:03-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:03):**  quite a bit of tenacity are still continuing with their traditions despite all of the influences  
**[0:59:13-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:13):**  of modern culture, tourism and everything else that's encroaching on their way of life.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:18):**  That's really tricky and I think that also is the key, is tenacity, resilience, sometimes  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:26):**  just plain stubbornness to know what's right and follow it because the world is going a  
**[0:59:31-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:31):**  different way mostly.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:33):**  And most people are looking to evolving in a different manner.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:38):**  It's programmed into us from our birth.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:44):**  Most people get separated from the mother at birth.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:49):**  That creates fear, brings fear into small baby that is brought into this world.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=0:59:57):**  From being one with its mother to being extracted and separated from the mother into a completely  
**[1:00:06-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:06):**  new and strange world.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:09):**  That fear, I believe, separates us from what would be our source of energy for the rest  
**[1:00:22-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:22):**  of our lives.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:23):**  And the source of energy gets supplanted by money.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:31):**  We learn from very small child, as a very small child that things are acquired through  
**[1:00:40-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:40):**  money.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:42):**  Any sustenance or any product that one may like and want comes through the exchange of  
**[1:00:49-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:49):**  money.  
**[1:00:51-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:00:51):**  So I believe that this system is supplanting our connection with our mother the earth with  
**[1:01:00-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:00):**  money.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:03):**  On that note, before we wrap up today, can you tell our listeners how they can contact  
**[1:01:09-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:09):**  you, learn more about these projects and perhaps even get involved?  
**[1:01:12-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:12):**  Certainly.

**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:25):**  pictures of the farm, the animals, some of the family, etc.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:30):**  And we also have a website called Teyoapa.com or.org.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:37):**  That's going to be the easiest way to contact us.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:40):**  Marvelous.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:41):**  Well, Jay, I can't thank you and the family enough for hosting me in this time that I've  
**[1:01:45-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:45):**  had here.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:46):**  I've learned so much, gained a lot of perspective, and just being able to share in the beauty  
**[1:01:51-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:51):**  of this region has been indescribable.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:54):**  I really hope I get a chance to come back and visit and collaborate again soon.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:01:59):**  Thank you, Oliver.

**[1:02:04-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jairo-rodriguez/#t=1:02:04):**  All right.

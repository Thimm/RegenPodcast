**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:00:12):**  regenerative living, where we walk away knowing a little bit more about humanity, where we  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:00:18):**  know that we have left an impact that ideally is positive on those around us and those that  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:00:24):**  we've met, and ultimately, you know, a greater sense of connection between one another.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:00:29):**  If the past year has anything to say about, you know, our lives, it's we really need to

**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:00:40):**  the amount of purpose and meaning that they had, and figuring out ways to connect more  
**[0:00:45-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:00:45):**  deeply to those elements of humanity and finding ways to expand on that through our travel,  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:00:52):**  through our experiences, and there are so many opportunities to do so.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:00:58):**  It's just a matter of, you know, leading with intention and then following through.

**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:02:14):**  Tokyo, Japan, and then immigrated to the US with my family when I was seven years old,  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:02:19):**  through moving more than nine times when I was a kid to taking off independently when

**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:02:26):**  Travel has been a lifestyle for me more than a hobby or a vacation, and I've often wondered  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:02:30):**  if my actions and contributions to the places that I've lived and visited could justify  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:02:35):**  the environmental impact of that way of living.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:02:39):**  Through reading and mentorship, my understanding of the concept of regeneration has evolved.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:02:43):**  I now understand how true regeneration goes beyond the do-good paradigm to development

**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:03:33):**  the tours and experiences that foster real connections and contributions that go both  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:03:38):**  ways.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:03:39):**  She explains how tours can break out of the mold that often shows local and indigenous  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:03:44):**  people as exotic and in need of help rather than fostering a deeper understanding of the  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:03:48):**  lives of the people that you're visiting.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:03:51):**  We cover some of the uncomfortable observations from having both lived in popular tourist  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:03:55):**  areas in Guatemala for years, and the patterns and assumptions that are often made by visitors  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:00):**  who are just passing through.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:02):**  This is certainly only one part of a much longer conversation that I hope to continue  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:06):**  to have around the subject of regenerative travel, but I think that Leila is the perfect  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:10):**  person to kick off the dialogue through her work and experience.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:14):**  So let's jump right in from the beginning.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:16):**  So Leila, why don't you tell me about this new project you've got with Naturally Smart  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:21):**  Travel?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:23):**  Well, Naturally Smart Travel is really a project that came into play back in 2019.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:31):**  I met a couple of friends who were looking for opportunity for investment down in Guatemala,  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:37):**  and they didn't necessarily know exactly how to approach it.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:41):**  And that's kind of a general understanding that I have in the world is just knowing there  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:45):**  are so many people out there that would like to make an impact, but they don't necessarily  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:49):**  have the opportunity in front of them.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:52):**  So when this opportunity presented itself, it kind of spawned this idea that we can connect  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:04:59):**  people with resources to people who are in need of those resources for growth and development.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:05):**  And this idea of creating these culturally immersive travel tours to bring people to  
**[0:05:13-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:13):**  Guatemala and really show them this beautiful country that's so welcoming and just offers  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:21):**  so much culture from their history all the way up until today to teach people about the  
**[0:05:27-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:27):**  needs of the country itself and all the different ways that they can really make an impact with  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:35):**  every one of their travel dollars.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:38):**  And so through Naturally Smart Travel, it's given opportunity, like I said, to connect  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:46):**  people with resources to those who are in need.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:49):**  And we'll be launching our tours at the end of this year.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:53):**  The first one will be in October, which is really exciting.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:05:56):**  We have a few people who are signed up and a few people signed up in November.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:00):**  And then the big launch will be in January.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:02):**  And that's where we'll start not just having the general tours of coming down and seeing  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:06):**  a little bit about what's happening with natural building and water reclamation and different  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:12):**  aspects of meeting community needs, but also working directly with businesses to bring  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:17):**  them down, to bring travelers in to get to know more about social enterprise directly.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:23):**  And yeah.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:24):**  Wow, that's a lot going on right there.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:29):**  And I know that this is actually part of an offshoot of a parent company that you've been  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:33):**  working with for some time.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:34):**  They used to tell me a lot about when we were in Guatemala together.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:37):**  So tell me how this offshoot ties into the mission of the parent company.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:43):**  Well, yes, this is very much an offshoot of the Pop-Up Foundation.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:49):**  And the Pop-Up Foundation, it was founded in the UK by a mentor of mine named Paul Clark,  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:06:57):**  who I know that you have spoken with and are familiar with.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:02):**  And Paul became a really excellent mentor from an event that we had both attended back  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:08):**  in 2015.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:11):**  And through his, getting to know him and understand him and learn more about the Pop-Up Foundation,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:18):**  the entire purpose was really to just get to know what the needs of individual communities  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:25):**  are around the world and to be able to reconnect them with nature and find different ways to  
**[0:07:31-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:31):**  give greater purpose to life through education and that reconnection with nature, finding  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:39):**  different elements of nature and being able to pull that into our daily lives, whether  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:42):**  you're in an urban setting or in a more rural area.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:48):**  So Paul himself has worked with different educators and indigenous tribes and different  
**[0:07:56-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:07:56):**  governments to find a way to kind of change or reconnect the subconscious of humans to  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:05):**  the greater being that is Earth to kind of evolve or reconnect with our purpose of being  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:12):**  here.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:13):**  And he's done that throughout his 40-plus year career.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:17):**  And I just got to meet him over the past few years and not necessarily ride his coattails,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:22):**  but certainly understand what his vision is and find a different area that he wasn't necessarily  
**[0:08:29-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:29):**  tapping into to kind of increase the exposure to that purpose of his work.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:38):**  And so kind of branching off of the Pop-Up Foundation, Naturally Smart Travel is very  
**[0:08:45-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:45):**  much rooted in all of the values and intent of the Pop-Up Foundation, but we're focused  
**[0:08:55-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:08:55):**  on a specific area to bring people into that purpose rather than bringing that purpose  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:03):**  to the people.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:04):**  Incredible.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:05):**  And so let's get down to what the primary differences are between normal types of travel,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:12):**  sustainable travel, regenerative travel.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:15):**  What does that mean to you, the difference in those words?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:18):**  To me, for a long time, I think it's interesting.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:23):**  For a very long time, I just saw the world as kind of, it's one big playground.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:31):**  And a number of years ago, a friend asked, what's the purpose of us being here anymore,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:37):**  humans as a species?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:39):**  And of course, the first thought is, well, sustainability or not necessarily sustainability  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:44):**  in the way that we think of it now, but just sustaining the species and ensuring our future  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:52):**  as a species.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:53):**  And then thought, as far as population goes, we've certainly got that covered.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:09:58):**  We've met our quota, if not exceeded it incredibly.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:02):**  So really the answer became experience, just to experience so much of what the world has  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:07):**  to offer, to see the beauty, to connect with different cultures, to really understand anthropology  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:13):**  and also how that connects to the future.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:16):**  And so travel early on, just for me at least, and I think that this still exists for a majority  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:24):**  of travelers, is going to different locations that might be new and exciting and fun.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:30):**  And maybe they have a bucket list or maybe it's just some random deal that they find  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:35):**  online and they just want to go and explore and escape where they're getting off the plane  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:41):**  and they're just going through all the highlights and snapping the pictures and then getting  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:46):**  back on the plane and returning to their normal lives.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:49):**  That is certainly, I think, the way that a lot of travel happens now, and it always has.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:10:55):**  But looking to sustainable travel, it's almost like an introduction to self-awareness through  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:00):**  your travel.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:02):**  So if you think of that old adage of, it's take no more than a picture, leave no more  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:10):**  than a footprint, when I think of sustainable travel, it reflects that.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:14):**  It's almost a snapshot in time of when you do get off the plane, you want to make sure  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:18):**  and just be aware of what your impact will be while you're there.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:22):**  You want to make sure that you haven't had any negative impact, and hopefully you've  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:25):**  left it a little bit better, but just knowing that you've done your part to at least preserve  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:31):**  it as it is when you arrive.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:35):**  And that's really great.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:36):**  It can lead to at least start the inner conversation of what it is that your travel can lead to  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:44):**  and what impact you truly have while you're traveling.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:50):**  And so I would say further down that conversation is where regenerative travel comes into play.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:11:57):**  And with regenerative travel, it's almost like you're looking to the future, but you're  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:01):**  doing so from the starting block.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:03):**  And when you think of the starting block, it's more so the blank canvas of virgin land,  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:07):**  untouched land where maybe there's a little bit of civilization, but there's something  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:11):**  beautiful and really intriguing about a location.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:15):**  What does it mean for us to be able to create an experience for others to come in and be  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:20):**  drawn to?  
**[0:12:21-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:21):**  Well, we have to cut down forest more than likely to be able to accommodate any of the  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:29):**  weaknesses that would support whatever the level of tourism is as an introduction, or  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:33):**  maybe it's further down the road a couple of decades, but there's a depletion of natural  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:38):**  resources.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:39):**  There's an introduction of foreign resources, whether that's concrete that's being poured  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:45):**  or foreign woods to support the structures, different metals, just foreign elements like  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:51):**  tar, things that nature otherwise wouldn't have experienced.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:12:57):**  And then as you increase that presence, there is the depletion of the natural resources  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:06):**  by the humans themselves, not just the structures that are supporting them.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:10):**  So loss of water, water contamination from any of the cleaning solvents or anything that  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:18):**  go, the toxins that go into the water, there's waste management and thinking about the waste  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:23):**  creation and if the infrastructure of that location can actually support the waste that's  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:29):**  being produced, and the list goes on.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:32):**  So I think with regenerative travel, you're thinking about this beautiful place, and of  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:38):**  course you're going there and you're experiencing it and it's wonderful, but you also want to  
**[0:13:41-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:41):**  make sure that that integrity isn't damaged, but you're leaving with having given back  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:49):**  so that you can replenish the beauty of that space and it can get more so back into its  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:55):**  natural state that led everyone there to begin with.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:13:58):**  So that's really the different elements of travel in my mind.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:02):**  Yeah, I really love the way you described that.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:05):**  It's a concept that I have been wrestling with for my entire adult life because both  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:10):**  of us lived in Guatemala and have traveled there and have had different professions while  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:15):**  we lived there and thinking about how the time that you spend and the efforts that your  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:22):**  time goes towards, whether or not it's actually contributing to what you want to see more  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:28):**  of there, or if you're facilitating what that highest potential of an area, what of a community  
**[0:14:35-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:35):**  or any of these other holes that we might represent, helping to facilitate that need  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:43):**  and potential within those communities or elements that we're talking about.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:47):**  And I think that's a difficult and nuanced separation between this concept of like doing  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:14:55):**  good in your time and your impact and facilitating higher potential.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:00):**  One being that you have an agenda for what you consider to be good and what you want  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:04):**  to see more of, and the other being allowing it to unfold and develop over time with the  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:10):**  unique elements and essence of the place and the people that you're interacting with.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:15):**  And I think you've really touched on something here, but I'm curious as to how you develop  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:18):**  this into a travel route.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:20):**  What were some of the elements and the holistic considerations that went into planning out  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:25):**  this event?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:29):**  That is a really wonderful question.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:31):**  It's a loaded question for sure.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:33):**  So we'll unpack it the best we can.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:37):**  But really traveling to Guatemala for the first time back in 2017, I didn't know what  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:42):**  to expect.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:43):**  And I can tell you not with a sense of pride, but just to put it in perspective, I couldn't  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:50):**  have picked Guatemala out on a map.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:52):**  I wouldn't have been able to do so.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:54):**  And arriving to it, I had no expectations.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:56):**  I didn't know what laid ahead.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:15:59):**  I was only supposed to be there for a month and ended up absolutely falling in love with  
**[0:16:03-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:03):**  the culture, the opportunity, and just seeing within that month all the different initiatives  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:11):**  or a handful of initiatives, I should say, that were rooted in making an impact and improving  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:17):**  the lives of the general community.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:21):**  And I hadn't really seen that to the scale that I was experiencing it then here in the  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:26):**  States.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:27):**  And it was something that was missing from my life, I think, that sense of purpose and  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:31):**  giving back and the ability to do so.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:34):**  So that month passed and I ended up deciding just to stay.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:38):**  And four and a half years later, I still consider it home.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:43):**  And over the past four and a half years, I've traveled through different parts of Guatemala  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:50):**  and have only learned more and more about people who are on the ground, Guatemalans  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:55):**  and some foreigners who are on the ground.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:16:58):**  And they're working with their communities because they understand what the community  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:02):**  needs are.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:03):**  They understand what the resources are that they can work within, what resources are needed  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:08):**  so that they can continue to grow.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:11):**  And they know exactly what to address.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:13):**  And I essentially think how to address them, the best approach.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:19):**  So learning about those initiatives, understanding the magnitude of the work that lies ahead  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:25):**  of them and how hard they're working to just make a difference in the quality of life.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:32):**  It just seemed like a natural pairing to reach to.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:38):**  I guess I should explain what I call a past life.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:41):**  I worked in the hospitality field for about 11 years as a hospitality manager, building  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:47):**  and cultivating experiences for families, for individuals.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:52):**  And that's always been something that's been kind of passion of mine.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:17:56):**  In another past life, I also worked in the startup industry alongside business executives  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:02):**  to help them grow internationally.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:05):**  And with that came a lot of knowledge and experience and a skill set that I think is  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:09):**  pretty unique.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:10):**  So the coupling of those past lives created opportunity for a future that I think brings  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:17):**  experience, understanding how to build a really memorable experience for individuals, how  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:23):**  to meet them by luxury or level of luxury that they might be interested in experiencing  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:27):**  while they're in this new location.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:30):**  And then also kind of tipping a hat to business itself and being able to see where these individuals  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:37):**  are within their initiatives, helping their communities and how to help them grow and  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:43):**  where that need might be.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:45):**  So introducing travelers to those initiatives and just seeing what we can do and the magic  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:52):**  that we can create by doing so.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:55):**  And that's really naturally smart, I think, kind of in a nutshell.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:18:59):**  It seems like such a logical progression for you, because as I've known you and as we became  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:05):**  friends in Guatemala, you were always putting people together.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:09):**  And I know you still are making connections and making sure that the right people talk  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:14):**  to each other when they're trying to move an initiative forward or trying to get some  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:17):**  work done.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:19):**  And it seems like this is a fantastic way to welcome people into a vision of Guatemala  
**[0:19:25-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:25):**  that is supporting its development through a variety of different projects and locations  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:33):**  that are representative of much more than just the tourist spots that you normally would  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:37):**  go to see.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:39):**  And I know we've already kind of talked about how you've decided and picked out some of  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:43):**  the places and some of the organizations, but what are the relationships that are being  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:49):**  developed even in such a short time as the timeframe that this tour is actually going  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:54):**  on?  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:19:56):**  Ideally, what's happening is, and again, excellent question.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:03):**  It's kind of a question that faces the approach of what are the travelers and the guests getting  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:11):**  out of this this time?  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:14):**  I mean, usually when the tours are happening, they're happening for maybe half a day or  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:18):**  a couple of hours.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:19):**  So it's what can guests really get from that experience besides just knowledge and walking  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:24):**  away knowing that they've experienced something new and exciting.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:30):**  And then also the question addresses what do we leave those initiatives with?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:36):**  What do we leave those projects with?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:38):**  Is it just the memory of someone that's walked through and gone, okay, yes.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:41):**  And another affirmation from a traveler who's saying, you're doing something great, please  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:45):**  keep it up.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:47):**  But ideally, when we bring guests down, we want them to connect with those communities  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:20:55):**  and the individuals who are leading the initiatives to really have an understanding of what the  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:01):**  social impact is, what the solution is, and what the solution, sorry, what it is that  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:06):**  they're solving with their initiative.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:10):**  We want to give opportunity for direct investment if that's something that someone's interested  
**[0:21:15-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:15):**  in just to be able to support or for donation if someone's willing to support monetarily.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:24):**  If they come down and someone has experience in the area of the initiative that we're visiting,  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:34):**  to be able to create a connection that's longer lasting so that if there's any sort of need  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:39):**  for mentorship or expansion or like you just said, connectivity to see if there are any  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:45):**  resources that can be shared, that that's long lasting.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:52):**  And the question kind of taps into as well what the longer goal, like the long-term goals  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:21:58):**  are for Naturally Smart.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:00):**  Of course, we'll host our tours and have impact within them, but further down the road, the  
**[0:22:09-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:09):**  idea has always been to offer capacity building courses and programs for the partners that  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:17):**  we go to visit and the initiatives that we go to visit, language classes to learn a little  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:21):**  bit more about English, which certainly opens up to a completely different market, being  
**[0:22:26-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:26):**  able to offer scholarships for continued education for younger generations, and ultimately investing  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:35):**  in the partnerships to help them grow.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:39):**  So it's not just about coming down and saying hi and seeing what someone's built and just  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:44):**  telling them that it's beautiful.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:46):**  It's about making sure that we're stretching our dollar and we're stretching our time to  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:51):**  cultivate relationships that are built on trust and longer lasting so that we can continue  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:55):**  to invest and continue to grow.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:22:58):**  I don't know if that answered the question quite well.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:02):**  Yeah, well look, it's something that we're always going to have to dance around because  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:06):**  I don't think it has a specific solution or a definition, so to speak.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:10):**  But this is kind of how we often connected back when I lived there is that there are  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:16):**  so many people working on so many different initiatives.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:19):**  It seems to be like the main occupation, especially of expat communities around Guatemala.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:24):**  Everyone's got some sort of foundation or some sort of school that they're trying to  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:28):**  move forward.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:29):**  And you and I would talk a lot about how these problems are a lot more nuanced than often  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:36):**  what people come down there thinking.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:39):**  And the impulse to, I mean, you could even call it like the white savior complex, to  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:44):**  go down there and think, oh, we know how to do this better.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:47):**  And I always point to the example of like seeing trash around in the campo and how people  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:53):**  would come by and, you know, even I remember having this kind of gut reaction when I first  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:23:59):**  came down there.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:00):**  It's like, oh man, this is really a shame.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:02):**  There's trash everywhere.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:03):**  Like we should get this cleaned up.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:04):**  But when you start to explore those underlying issues, it's like, do we really have this  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:10):**  solved in the West?  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:12):**  Because we as individuals per capita generate tons and tons more garbage than anybody living  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:19):**  down there for the most part.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:22):**  And the difference being that we have the riches and the infrastructure to make it somebody  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:28):**  else's problem or to ship it away out of sight and out of mind.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:31):**  And we have somehow gotten into this line of thinking that we are the cleaner culture  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:38):**  just because we consolidate it and put it somewhere else.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:42):**  And just because their trash stays where it gets thrown away or, you know, the infrastructure  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:49):**  does not make it somebody else's problem and it compiles in the neighborhoods, does that  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:54):**  mean that they're consuming more or throwing away more than we are?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:24:58):**  And you know, there are so many other transparent examples of those gut reaction problems that  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:03):**  people are trying to solve, but don't actually get to the root of what the issues are.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:08):**  So with evaluating the projects that you've included on this tour, how have you understood,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:17):**  I mean, I'm sure you have relationships with all of the people who are running them.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:22):**  Where are the impact driven solutions here that are more than just Band-Aid fixes and  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:28):**  go beyond this, we have all this solved in the West, let's bring our ideas over to Guatemala  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:33):**  and fix their societal problem attitude?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:38):**  It kind of, another great question, it kind of goes back to what we shared before, as  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:45):**  far as working directly with community leaders and initiative leaders who are on the ground  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:51):**  in Guatemala.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:53):**  And of course there is, you know, the white saver complex like you shared, and that's  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:25:59):**  the opposite of our goal.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:01):**  We want to make sure that we're going in and we're nurturing the ideas and the initiatives  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:05):**  that know quite directly what the communities need, how to approach it, what the limitations  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:11):**  are, and it's all by experience.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:13):**  It's not by coming in and seeing something on the surface and saying, oh, I've got a  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:17):**  solution for that.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:18):**  And this is exactly how you can do it.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:20):**  It's taking the time to get to know the individuals and building that trust and building that  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:25):**  relationship and trusting that they know their communities well enough to find solutions  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:31):**  that are truly solving, like not just creating a Band-Aid, but truly solving the root issue.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:38):**  A really great example would be there's Magic Classrooms.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:44):**  And so Magic Classrooms, it's an initiative that I connected with earlier this year, and  
**[0:26:50-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:50):**  I'm just now getting to know, but they are focused on teaching young kids who are, I  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:26:59):**  guess, preschool age, how to learn.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:02):**  They give opportunity for employment for an entrepreneur who essentially becomes the leader  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:09):**  or the teacher of anywhere from 10 to 20 kids, often 10 to 15.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:17):**  And those kids come into this classroom.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:20):**  It doesn't have to be a formal space.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:22):**  More often than not, they have found that working with established schools actually  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:27):**  makes it much more difficult.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:28):**  They need to have their own space in a classroom that's developed, that's private, and have  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:34):**  these entrepreneurs who are the leaders of these kids teach them, get them engaged, get  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:39):**  them understanding the value of education and what it can really mean for their future.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:44):**  That way they're prepared to go into first grade.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:47):**  And by the time that they get into first grade, they're excited about learning.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:51):**  And the success rate has been really great for them.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:27:55):**  They've been around for just under a decade, and they have over 75 different classrooms  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:02):**  throughout Guatemala.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:03):**  Their goal is ultimately to grow to just over 150 classrooms.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:10):**  And the success rate for students making it to sixth grade, to ninth grade, to 11th grade,  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:15):**  has been, they've seen a dramatic increase just by getting to them as kids and just saying,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:22):**  this is something that's really important in your life.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:24):**  These are fun ways that you get to be a part of education and how it's going to help you.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:28):**  And those are the kinds of initiatives that are creating opportunity for employment that  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:33):**  are really impacting the future of these children.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:36):**  Those are the kinds of initiatives that we're looking for, things that have proven track  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:40):**  records, that have metrics that they can go by to see what the success rate is for not  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:46):**  just the business itself, but for the impact in the community.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:52):**  And so that's just one example of many that I can probably go into.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:28:56):**  Well, I'm going to put your feet to the fire and get you to explain one more to me, because  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:02):**  I noticed throughout the itinerary that you have included a stop at the farm that I used  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:07):**  to work at and helped to develop in Sununá, right?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:11):**  Yes.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:12):**  And I haven't been in touch with Jeremy, Adriana, and Neil for a couple of weeks now, but why  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:18):**  don't you tell us what that stop represents and some of the activities that they could  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:23):**  imagine doing there in that brief time?  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:27):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:29):**  So Granhátikin is just a beautiful place, you know, just in general.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:38):**  I think, you know, stopping in and seeing a beautiful view of the lake is wonderful  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:43):**  to see these natural buildings is really wonderful.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:47):**  Seeing a bit about permaculture and the importance of kind of shifting away from pesticides and  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:29:53):**  traditional or not traditional, but I should say industrial agriculture and understanding  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:00):**  the importance of diversity and what you can do by using permaculture methods, not just  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:08):**  at home, but also, and I'm sure, you know, in discussing this with Neil, understanding  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:13):**  how it can be applied to larger scale corporations.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:19):**  And I guess, you know, for me, that represents the future, ideally, a really great solution  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:30):**  for the future of agriculture is pulling from these principles and not just, you know, sitting  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:36):**  there and preaching about it, but actually putting it into play and teaching others how  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:41):**  it can be beneficial for them, not just for their bodies and, you know, the communities  
**[0:30:46-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:46):**  and, you know, in nature, but also just for their businesses as a whole, as they reach  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:54):**  out to larger corporations and all of that.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:30:58):**  So ideally, the afternoon or our visit there will be connecting with, you know, Neil and  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:05):**  Jeremy and Adriana and learning about what led them to creating this incredible place.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:12):**  But then also what that represents for them and what that can potentially represent for  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:17):**  the future, not just of Guatemala, but I mean, there's so much potential.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:21):**  And, you know, the whole point of this travel and the tours that we're cultivating is immersion.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:30):**  And so if you're there, if you can see it in front of you, if you can see the beauty  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:33):**  of the space that they've cultivated and understand what the purpose and the meaning is behind  
**[0:31:39-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:39):**  it, then it's much more of an experience, a memorable experience, something that's long  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:47):**  lasting and that really plants the seed for the guests.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:51):**  When they go home, they'll be thinking about, you know, ideally some of their consumption  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:31:56):**  and their habits and just thinking a little bit larger about what that means for, you  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:02):**  know, the world and how we can start to shift into more sustainable, a more sustainable  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:08):**  culture.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:09):**  So that's a really long answer to.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:14):**  Let me add to that real quick, because I've been to so many different permaculture farms.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:18):**  I've worked on a few of them.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:20):**  Goodness knows there's a ton of them at the lake.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:22):**  One thing that I can say for the projects that that group is doing down there is that  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:26):**  they work a lot with local farmers and their site is actually fairly small.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:31):**  And so a big part of the initiatives of that project are helping to bring back poly culture,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:38):**  climate and soil appropriate agriculture systems for the primary crops that that place is already  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:43):**  producing, which for the most part is coffee.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:46):**  But at the same time, bringing back heritage varieties of avocados and bring in all of  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:52):**  the different elements that can create a very healthy ecosystem out of the coffee production  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:32:57):**  that they're already used to and really spreading that throughout the entire community, rather  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:01):**  than just bringing in foreigners and teaching them permaculture and doing some herb spirals  
**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:06):**  and moving on because there's a lot of those, too.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:09):**  But yeah, it's been fantastic to see how much that place has grown and developed over time.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:14):**  And I want to go on that tour just to go back and see my old farm.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:18):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:20):**  I think that you would you would fall in love with it all over again for so many different  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:25):**  reasons.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:26):**  It has changed so much since I've left.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:27):**  I was talking actually to Charlie Rendell the other day and he was talking about how  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:31):**  many people have bought land there and how that community is really starting to come  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:34):**  into its own these days.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:36):**  It is.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:37):**  But back in the day when we first met, I remember there were so many conversations that we had  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:41):**  about the potential for Sununna.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:44):**  And you look at like you said, there are so many different you know, in any of the towns,  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:50):**  there are so many different initiatives that are rooted in permaculture, agriculture and  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:54):**  all of that.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:33:55):**  But there are also a little bit of rifts that come up between the locals and the foreigners  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:03):**  and just making sure that there's a bridge between those communities and that they're  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:08):**  really working in parallel and seeing that opportunity.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:14):**  I think we always talked about how wonderful it would be and how that was really the goal  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:18):**  of the foreigners who are coming in to not necessarily leave behind the local community  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:26):**  and just get by their land and develop their land and just focus on what the benefits are  
**[0:34:30-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:30):**  for them individually, but finding ways to raise the community as well along that path.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:37):**  And I think Sununna is such a shiny example of how you're able to do that while still  
**[0:34:43-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:43):**  staying successful on your own.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:45):**  You're able to bring everyone else to the table so that they can also feast.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:48):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:51):**  Before we wrap up, can you tell our listeners where they can find more information about  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:54):**  these types of tours and follow how this continues to develop?  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:34:59):**  Yeah, absolutely.

**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:35:08):**  I'm hoping as people type in naturallysmart.me, they actually take in a little sense of them

**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/leilani-yats-on-the-nuances-and-aspirations-of-regenerative-travel/#t=0:35:37):**  not just about the locations that we're going to and fun tour highlights, but also
